<b>SUBCHAPTER S. NEWBORN HEARING SCREENING</b>
<P>
The Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services
Commission (HHSC), on behalf of the Department of State Health Services
(DSHS), proposes the repeal of &#167;&#167;37.501 - 37.507, and new
&#167;&#167;37.501 - 37.509, concerning Newborn Hearing Screening.
<P>
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
<P>
The purpose of the proposal is to repeal the rules in Chapter 37,
Subchapter S, and replace with new rules. The repeal and replace is
necessary to comply with amendments to Texas Health and Safety Code
Chapter 47, Hearing Loss in Newborns, made by House Bill 2255 and
Senate Bill 1404 passed during the 86th Legislature, Regular Session,
2019. This proposal also serves as the four-year review of rules required
by Texas Government Code &#167;2001.039. 
<P>
DSHS administers the Newborn Hearing Screening Program and provides
guidance for performing point-of-care hearing screening required for
all newborns in the state. The proposed new rules are structured to
refine roles and responsibilities, update definitions, emphasize required
reporting, and clarify the purpose of consent. The proposed new rules
will also implement new legislative mandates. Referrals to the primary
statewide resource center at the Texas School for the Deaf will be
required for infants who are suspected or confirmed to be deaf or
hard of hearing, and DSHS will make educational resources available
for parents.
<P>
SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.501 describes the purpose and application
of the Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 47 to ensure all babies
born in Texas receive a hearing screening, intervention, and referrals
to services if they are suspected or diagnosed as deaf or hard of hearing.
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.502 provides definitions of terms used within
the subchapter. 
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.503 describes the process of screening and
consent to release individually identifying information. 
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.504 describes the process of required reporting
using the DSHS's Texas Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Management
Information System. 
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.505 describes the birthing facility screening
provider responsibilities. 
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.506 describes the follow-up screening provider responsibilities.
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.507 describes the diagnostic evaluation provider responsibilities.
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.508 describes DSHS responsibilities.
<P>
Proposed new &#167;37.509 describes the authorized newborn hearing
screening services.
<P>
FISCAL NOTE
<P>
Donna Sheppard, Chief Financial Officer, has determined that for
each year of the first five years that the rules will be in effect,
enforcing or administering the rules do not have foreseeable implications
relating to costs or revenues of state or local governments. 
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT 
<P>
DSHS has determined that during the first five years that the rules
will be in effect:
<P>
(1) the proposed rules will not create or eliminate a government program;
<P>
(2) implementation of the proposed rules will not affect the number
of DSHS employee positions;
<P>
(3) implementation of the proposed rules will result in no assumed
change in future legislative appropriations; 
<P>
(4) the proposed rules will not affect fees paid to DSHS; 
<P>
(5) the proposed rules will create new rules;
<P>
(6) the proposed rules will repeal existing rules;
<P>
(7) the proposed rules will not change the number of individuals
subject to the rules; and
<P>
(8) the proposed rules will not affect the state's economy. 
<P>
SMALL BUSINESS, MICRO-BUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMUNITY IMPACT ANALYSIS 
<P>
Donna Sheppard has also determined that there will be no adverse
economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities. 
<P>
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT
<P>
The proposed rules will not affect a local economy.
<P>
COSTS TO REGULATED PERSONS 
<P>
Texas Government Code &#167;2001.0045 does not apply to these rules
because the rules are necessary to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the residents of Texas and the rules do not impose a cost
on regulated persons.
<P>
PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COSTS
<P>
Manda Hall, M.D., Community Health Improvement Associate Commissioner,
has determined that for each year of the first five years the rules
are in effect, the public benefit will ensure all babies born in Texas
receive a hearing screening and receive proper intervention and referrals
to services as early as possible, if suspected or diagnosed as deaf
or hard of hearing.
<P>
Donna Sheppard has also determined that for the first five years
the rules are in effect, there are no anticipated economic costs to
persons who are required to comply with the proposed rules, because
programs are already required to make referrals to early childhood
intervention and DSHS educational materials are distributed free of charge.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
<P>
DSHS has determined that the proposal does not restrict or limit
an owner's right to his or her property that would otherwise exist
in the absence of government action and, therefore, does not constitute
a taking under Texas Government Code &#167;2007.043. 
<P>

Screening Unit, TEHDI Program Mail Code 1918, P.O. Box 149347, Austin,
