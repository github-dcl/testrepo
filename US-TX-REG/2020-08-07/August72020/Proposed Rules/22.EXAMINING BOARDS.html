to the merger of operations of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers
and the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying into the Texas
Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors (TBPELS).
<P>
As required by HB 1523, the operations of the two agencies have
been merged into one and the associated rules regarding operations
of the agency have been merged into Chapter 131 per the guidance of
the Secretary of State. These rules reflect language that has been
expanded to include the name of the new agency, the regulation of
land surveying, and other changes incorporated due to the merger.
Some language has been included from the previous surveying rules
including 22 Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 661.

FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
<P>
Dr. Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E., Executive Director for the Board,
has determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed
rules are in effect, there are no estimated additional costs or reductions
in costs to state or local government as a result of enforcing or
administering the proposed rule.
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five
years the proposed rules are in effect, there is no estimated increase
or loss in revenue to the state or local government as a result of
enforcing or administering the proposed rule.
<P>
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that the proposed rules will not affect
the local economy, so the agency is not required to prepare a local
employment impact statement under Government Code &#167;2001.022.
<P>
PUBLIC BENEFITS
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rules are in effect, the public benefit will be
the efficient and effective merger and operations of the Texas Board
of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors per HB 1523 and clarified
rule language.
<P>
PROBABLE ECONOMIC COSTS TO PERSONS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSAL
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rules are in effect, there are no anticipated
economic costs to persons who are required to comply with the proposed
rules because the changes are related to agency operations as set
forth in HB 1523, Occupations Code 1001 and 1071.
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES, MICRO-BUSINESSES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES
<P>
There will be no adverse effect on small businesses, micro-businesses,
or rural communities as a result of the proposed rules. Since the
agency has determined that the proposed rules will have no adverse
economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities,
preparation of an Economic Impact Statement and a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code &#167;2006.002,
is not required.
<P>
ONE-FOR-ONE REQUIREMENT FOR RULES WITH A FISCAL IMPACT
<P>
The proposed rules do not have a fiscal note that imposes a cost
on regulated persons, including another state agency, a special district,
or a local government. Therefore, the agency is not required to take
any further action under Government Code &#167;2001.0045.
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Pursuant to Government Code &#167;2001.0221, the agency provides
the following Government Growth Impact Statement for the proposed
rules. For each year of the first five years the proposed rules are
in effect, the agency has determined the following:
<P>
1. The proposed rules do not create or eliminate a government program.
<P>
2. Implementation of the proposed rules do not require the creation
of new employee positions or the elimination of existing employee positions.
<P>
3. Implementation of the proposed rules do not require an increase
or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency.
<P>
4. The proposed rules do not require an increase or decrease in
fees paid to the agency.
<P>
5. The proposed rules do not create a new regulation. 
<P>
6. The proposed rules do not expand, limit, or repeal a regulation
except as provided by HB 1532 which transferred the regulation of
land surveying to the TBPELS, and these rules reflect a transfer of
that regulatory authority from the former Board of Professional Land
Surveying to the TBPELS.
<P>
7. The proposed rules do not increase the number of individuals
subject to the rule's applicability. 
<P>
8. The proposed rules do not positively or adversely affect this
state's economy.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
<P>
The Board has determined that no private real property interests
are affected by the proposed rules and the proposed rules do not restrict,
limit, or impose a burden on an owner's rights to his or her private
real property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government
action. As a result, the proposed rules do not constitute a taking
or require a takings impact assessment under Government Code &#167;2007.043.
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL RULE ANALYSIS
<P>
The Board has determined that the proposed rules are not brought
with the specific intent to protect the environment or reduce risks
to human health from environmental exposure; thus, the Board asserts
the proposed rules are not a "major environmental rule," as defined
by Government Code &#167;2001.0225. As a result, the Board asserts
preparation of an environmental impact analysis, as provided by &#167;2001.0225,
is not required.
<P>

<B>CHAPTER 134.<a name=53> LICENSING, REGISTRATION, AND CERTIFICATION FOR SURVEYORS</a></B>
<P>
The Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors
(Board) proposes new rules to 22 Texas Administrative Code, Chapter
134, specifically &#167;&#167;134.1, 134.3, 134.5, 134.11. 134.21,
134.23, 134.25, 134.27, 134.29, 134.31, 134.35, 134.37, 134.41, 134.43,
134.51, 134.53, 134.55, 134.61, 134.65, 134.67 - 134.69, 134.71, 134.73,
134.75, 134.81, 134.83, 134.87, 134.89, 134.91, 134.93, 134.95, and
134.97, regarding the licensure and registration process for professional
land surveyors in Texas. These proposed changes are referred to as
"proposed rules."
<P>
EXPLANATION OF AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RULES
<P>
The rules under 22 Texas Administrative Code Chapter 134 implement
Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1001, the Texas Engineering Practice
Act, and Occupations Code, Chapter 1071, the Professional Land Surveying
Practices Act.
<P>
The proposed rules implement necessary changes as required by House
Bill (HB) 1523, 86th Legislature, Regular Session (2019), related
to the merger of operations of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers
and the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying into the Texas
Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors (TBPELS).
<P>
As required by HB 1523, the operations of the two agencies have
been merged into one, including the registration of Surveyors-in-Training
(SIT) and Registered Professional Land Surveyors (RPLS), and the licensure
of Licensed State Land Surveyors (LSLS). The previous agency rules
(22 Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 661), related to registration
of land surveyors, have been merged into Chapter 134 per the guidance
of the Secretary of State. These rules have been formatted to be similar
to the licensure rules for engineers (Chapter 133) and edits made
for format and clarity.
<P>
SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.1, concerning
the general process for obtaining an SIT designation. Texas Board
of Professional Land Surveying (TBPLS) rule, 22 Texas Administrative
Code &#167;661.41, addresses all land surveyor license types. This
new rule only addresses SIT and provides general information on the
processing of applications to obtain this type of certification, thereby
making it easier for someone interested in this type of certification
to locate the rules that apply to this certification type.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.3, concerning
the requirements to obtain a SIT certification and general information
concerning this certification. This includes the examination required,
expiration of an SIT certification, and certification renewal process.
This rule consolidates requirements for an SIT certification found
in TBPLS rules &#167;661.41 and &#167;661.51, thereby making it easier
to locate the rules applying to this certification type.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.5, concerning
Surveyor-in-Training experience requirements. Many of the SIT experience
requirements found in TBPLS rule &#167;661.50 have been moved to this
new chapter that concerns certification of SITs. This new rule makes
it easier to locate the rules applying to an SIT.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.11, concerning
types of surveyor registrations and licenses. It identifies the types
of licenses and registrations. It states that applications that do
not meet requirements will be denied.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.21, concerning
the application process for a standard registration as a professional
land surveyor (RPLS). It streamlines the application process and adds
the requirement for fingerprinting for criminal background checks.
It conforms with many of the application requirements for obtaining
a professional engineer license.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.23, concerning
the application process for a former standard registration as a professional
land surveyor (RPLS). It describes the application requirements needed
to update information and verify qualifications to issue a new registration.
It makes it easier for former standard registration holders to obtain
a license, thereby removing many of the previous barriers to licensure.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.25, concerning
the application process for an applicant who holds an out-of-state
registration. This new rule streamlines the process for obtaining
a Texas license by consolidating many of the requirements found in
&#167;661.41 and &#167;661.47 of the TBPLS rules concerning out-of-state
applicants. This rule conforms with the requirements of out-of-state
engineers applying for a Texas license.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.27, concerning
the application process for a Licensed State Land Surveyor (LSLS).
The TBPLS surveyor rules did not describe the LSLS process as pointed
out by the TBPLS 2019 Sunset Commission report. These rules document
the current process and requirements utilized by the TBPLS and were
developed in consultation with the General Land Office.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.29, concerning
the temporary license process for military spouses who are licensed
or registered in another state. This section implements Senate Bill
(SB) 1200, 86th Legislature, Regular Session (2019), which amends
Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 55, to authorize a military spouse
to engage in a business or occupation for which a license is required,
without obtaining the applicable license, if the military spouse is
currently licensed in good standing by another jurisdiction that has
licensing requirements that are substantially equivalent to the licensing
requirements in Texas. SB 1200 also authorizes a licensing agency
to issue a license to a military spouse who meets such requirements.
It conforms with the requirements of engineering rule &#167;133.29,
which was adopted in March 2020.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.31, concerning
educational requirements for applicants. Unlike TBPLS rule &#167;661.41
that addressed the multiple requirements for applications, this rule
makes it easier for applicants to find the education requirements
by listing them in a separate rule
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.35, concerning
proof of educational requirements for applicants. Unlike TBPLS rule
&#167;661.41, which addressed the multiple requirements for applications,
this rule makes it easier for applicants to find the necessary proof
of educational qualifications by listing them in a separate rule
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.37, requiring
that educational documents for registration be in English. Unlike
TBPLS rule &#167;661.41, which addressed the multiple requirements
for applications, this rule makes it easier for applicants to find
the requirement that non-English documents supporting application
be translated to English.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.41, concerning
supplementary experience records for applicants. Unlike TBPLS rule
&#167;661.4, which addressed the multiple requirements for applications,
this rule makes it easier for applicants to find the requirements
for supplementary experience by listing them in a separate rule.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.43, concerning
the experience evaluation process for applicants. It consolidates
TBPLS rules &#167;&#167;661.41, 661.50, and 661.53 by providing one
rule that addresses the evaluation of supplementary experience.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.51, concerning
reference providers for applicants. In addition to the requirements
of TBPLS rule &#167;661.43, this rule adds the additional requirement
that the reference must not receive compensation for providing a reference.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.53, concerning
reference statements for applicants. Although this rule is largely
based on TBPLS rule, it provides a more detailed process for submitting
a reference, states that there are repercussions if an applicant retaliates
against a reference, and permits an NCEES record reference document
to serve as a reference statement.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.55, concerning
references for applicants. It conforms with TBPLS rule &#167;661.43.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.61, concerning
examinations and the general examination process for applicants. Unlike
TBPLS rule &#167;661.45, which addressed the multiple requirements
for examinations, this rule makes it easier for applicants to find
the process requirements for surveying exams.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.65, concerning
the examination on the Fundamentals of Surveying. It consolidates
portions of TBPLS rules &#167;661.41 and &#167;661.45 by creating
a rule that only addresses the Fundamentals of Surveying exam. This
makes it easier for an applicant to locate the rule that addresses
this exam because the information is contained in one rule.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.67, concerning
the examination on the Principles and Practice of Surveying. It consolidates
portions of TBPLS rules &#167;661.41 and &#167;661.45 by creating
a rule that only addresses the Principles and Practice of Surveying
exam. In addition to the examination developed by the TBPELS, the
proposed rules expand the examination options to include the Principles
and Practice of Surveying exam offered by the National Council of
Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES). This addition was
noted by the TBPLS 2019 Sunset Commission report. After review of
the various examination options, the Surveying Advisory Committee
and the Board concurred to move forward with moving to this exam option.
By creating a single rule that addresses the Principles and Practice
of Surveying exam, it easier for an applicant to locate the rule.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.68, concerning
the examination required for licensure as a Licensed State Land Surveyor
(LSLS). Unlike TBPLS rule &#167;661.45, which addressed the multiple
examinations, this rule makes it easier for applicants to find the
requirements for LSLS exam by addressing the exam in a single rule.
This rule was developed in consultation with the General Land Office.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.69, concerning
the process for waiver of examination requirements for the Fundamentals
of Surveying. Waiver of exams is permitted for out-of-state land surveyors,
as authorized by Texas Occupations Code &#167;1071.259, provided they
meet certain requirements
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.71, that states
that a land surveyor registered in Texas may take the principles and
practice of surveying examination for record purposes only if her
or she has not passed the exam.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.73, concerning
examination results and analysis. This language has been added to
implement Texas Occupations Code &#167;1001.273 for surveying examinations. 
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.75, concerning
examination irregularities. The rule sets out the process and penalties
for violations of examination policies.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.81, concerning
the process for reviewing surveyor applications. The rule sets out
the procedure and requirements for staff to process a surveyor application
that was not previously described in TBPLS rules. This rule conforms
with the engineering application processing rule &#167;133.81.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.83, concerning
the process for the review and evaluation of surveyor applications.
The rule sets out the procedure and requirements for staff to review
and evaluate a surveyor application that was not previously described
in TBPLS rules. This rule conforms with the engineering application
processing rule &#167;133.83.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.87, concerning
final actions that can be taken on surveyor applications. The rule
sets out the procedure and requirements for staff to review and evaluate
a surveyor application that were not previously described in TBPLS
rules. This rule conforms with the engineering application processing
rule &#167;133.87.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.89, concerning
the processing of administratively withdrawn surveyor applications.
The rule sets out the procedure and requirements for staff to review
and evaluate a surveyor application that was not previously described
in TBPLS rules. This rule conforms with the engineering application
processing rule &#167;133.89.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.91, concerning
the reconsideration of denied surveyor applications. This rule describes
when a denial may be reconsidered or not reconsidered. The rule sets
out the procedure and requirements for staff to review and evaluate
a surveyor application that was not previously described in TBPLS
rules. This rule conforms with the engineering application processing
rule &#167;133.91.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.93, concerning
the process for personal interviews of surveyor applicants and when
it is available. The rule sets out the procedure and requirements
that were not previously described in TBPLS rules. This rule conforms
with the engineering application processing rule &#167;133.93.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.95, concerning
the handling and storage of application files. The rule sets out the
procedure and requirements for staff to store and handle surveyor
application files that was not previously described in TBPLS rules.
This rule conforms with the engineering application processing rule &#167;133.95.
<P>
The proposed rules create a new section, &#167;134.97, concerning
the issuance of a surveyor registration. The rule sets out the procedure
and requirements that were not previously described in TBPLS rules.
This rule conforms with the engineering application processing rule &#167;133.83.
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
<P>
Dr. Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E., Executive Director for the Board,
has determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed
rules are in effect, there are no estimated additional costs or reductions
in costs to state or local government as a result of enforcing or
administering the proposed rules. The rules impose no additional costs.
HB 1523 transferred regulatory authority from TBPLS to TBPELS, and
these rules merely reflect that transfer of authority.
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five
years the proposed rules are in effect, there is no estimated increase
or loss in revenue to the state or local government as a result of
enforcing or administering the proposed rule.
<P>
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that the proposed rules will not affect
the local economy, so the agency is not required to prepare a local
employment impact statement under Government Code &#167;2001.022.
<P>
PUBLIC BENEFITS
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rules are in effect, the public benefit will be
the clear requirements for the efficient and effective registration
and licensure of professional land surveyors by the Texas Board of
Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors in accordance with HB 1523
and Texas Occupations Code chapters 1001 and 1071.
<P>
PROBABLE ECONOMIC COSTS TO PERSONS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSAL
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rules are in effect, the rules related to registration
do not make substantive changes to the registration process and have
no additional costs for registrants or the agency. The National Professional
Surveying examination is more expensive than the current RPLS exam
($150 for current exam; National exam is $300) and will impact new
RPLS applicants (&lt;100 applicants annually).
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES, MICRO-BUSINESSES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES
<P>
There will be no adverse effect on small businesses, micro-businesses,
or rural communities as a result of the proposed rules. Since the
agency has determined that the proposed rules will have no adverse
economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities,
preparation of an Economic Impact Statement and a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code &#167;2006.002,
is not required.
<P>
ONE-FOR-ONE REQUIREMENT FOR RULES WITH A FISCAL IMPACT
<P>
The proposed rules do not have a fiscal note that imposes a cost
on regulated persons, including another state agency, a special district,
or a local government. Therefore, the agency is not required to take
any further action under Government Code &#167;2001.0045.
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Pursuant to Government Code &#167;2001.0221, the agency provides
the following Government Growth Impact Statement for the proposed rules.
<P>
HB 1532 transferred the regulation of land surveying to the TBPELS,
and these rules reflect a transfer of that regulatory authority from
the former Board of Professional Land Surveying to the TBPELS without
any growth in government. Therefore, for each year of the first five
years the proposed rules are in effect, the agency has determined
the following:
<P>
1. The proposed rules do not create or eliminate a government program.
<P>
2. Implementation of the proposed rules does not require the creation
of new employee positions or the elimination of existing employee positions.
<P>
3. Implementation of the proposed rules does not require an increase
or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency.
<P>
4. The proposed rules do not require an increase or decrease in
fees paid to the agency.
<P>
5. The proposed rules do not create a new regulation.
<P>
6. The proposed rules do not expand, limit, or repeal a regulation,
except as provided by HB 1532, which transferred the regulation of
land surveying to the TBPELS, and these rules reflect a transfer of
that regulatory authority from the former Board of Professional Land
Surveying to the TBPELS.
<P>
7. The proposed rules do not increase the number of individuals
subject to the rule's applicability.
<P>
8. The proposed rules do not positively or adversely affect this
state's economy.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
<P>
The Board has determined that no private real property interests
are affected by the proposed rules and the proposed rules do not restrict,
limit, or impose a burden on an owner's rights to his or her private
real property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government
action. As a result, the proposed rules do not constitute a taking
or require a takings impact assessment under Government Code &#167;2007.043.
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL RULE ANALYSIS
<P>
The Board has determined that the proposed rules are not brought
with the specific intent to protect the environment or reduce risks
to human health from environmental exposure; thus, the Board asserts
the proposed rules are not a "major environmental rule," as defined
by Government Code &#167;2001.0225. As a result, the Board asserts
preparation of an environmental impact analysis, as provided by &#167;2001.0225,
is not required.
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENTS
<P>
Any comments or request for a public hearing may be submitted,
no later than 30 days after the publication of this notice, to Lance
Kinney, Ph.D., P.E., Executive Director, Texas Board of Professional
Engineers, 1917 S. Interstate 35, Austin, Texas 78741, faxed to his

<P>
The Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors (Board) proposes new rules to 22 Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 136, specifically &#167;&#167;136.1, 136.3, and 136.5 regarding the registration process for professional land surveying firms in
Texas. These proposed changes are referred to as "proposed rules."
<P>
EXPLANATION OF AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RULES
<P>
The rules under 22 Texas Administrative Code Chapter 136 implement
Texas Occupations Code, Chapter 1001, the Texas Engineering Practice
Act, and Occupations Code, Chapter 1071, the Professional Land Surveying
Practices Act.
<P>
The proposed rules implement necessary changes as required by House
Bill (HB) 1523, 86th Legislature, Regular Session (2019), related
to the merger of operations of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers
and the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying (TBPLS) into the
Texas Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors (TBPELS).
<P>
As required by HB 1523, the operations of the two agencies have
been merged into one, including the registration of surveying firms.
The previous agency rules (22 Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 661),
related to registration of land surveying firms, have been merged
into Chapter 136 per the guidance of the Secretary of State. These
rules have been formatted to be similar to the licensure rules for
engineers (Chapter 135) and edits made for format and clarity. 
<P>
SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY
<P>
The proposed rules create a new &#167;136.1 concerning the Board's
general authority to register surveying firms and its authority to
deny a firm registration if board requirements are not met in conformance
with TBPLS rule &#167;661.55. 
<P>
The proposed rules create a new &#167;136.3 concerning the application
process to register surveying firms. Like TBPLS rule &#167;661.55,
it provides the details for the application process. 
<P>
The proposed rules create a new &#167;136.5 concerning the renewal
of surveying firms. This rule directs firm registrants to Chapter
138 for guidance on the firm renewal process and requirements for
land surveying firms. 
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
<P>
Dr. Lance Kinney, Ph.D., P.E., Executive Director for the Board,
has determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed
rules are in effect, there are no estimated additional costs or reductions
in costs to state or local government as a result of enforcing or
administering the proposed rules. These proposed rules impose no additional
costs. HB 1523 transferred regulatory authority from TBPLS to TBPELS,
and these rules merely reflect the transfer of authority.
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five
years the proposed rules are in effect, there is no estimated increase
or loss in revenue to the state or local government as a result of
enforcing or administering the proposed rules.
<P>
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that the proposed rules will not affect
the local economy, so the agency is not required to prepare a local
employment impact statement under Government Code &#167;2001.022.
<P>
PUBLIC BENEFITS
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rules are in effect, the public benefit will be
clear requirements for the efficient and effective registration of
land surveying firms by TBPELS in accordance with HB 1523 and Texas
Occupations Code chapters 1001 and 1071.
<P>
PROBABLE ECONOMIC COSTS TO PERSONS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSAL
<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rules are in effect, the rules related to registration
do not make substantive changes to the firm registration process and
have no additional costs for registrants or the agency. 
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES, MICRO-BUSINESSES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES
<P>
There will be no adverse effect on small businesses, micro-businesses,
or rural communities as a result of the proposed rules. Since the
agency has determined that the proposed rules will have no adverse
economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities,
preparation of an Economic Impact Statement and a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code &#167;2006.002,
is not required.
<P>
ONE-FOR-ONE REQUIREMENT FOR RULES WITH A FISCAL IMPACT
<P>
The proposed rules do not have a fiscal note that imposes a cost
on regulated persons, including another state agency, a special district,
or a local government. Therefore, the agency is not required to take
any further action under Government Code &#167;2001.0045.
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Pursuant to Government Code &#167;2001.0221, the agency provides
the following Government Growth Impact Statement for the proposed rules. 
<P>
HB 1532 transferred the regulation of land surveying to TBPELS,
and these rules reflect a transfer of that regulatory authority from
the former Texas Board of Professional Engineers to the TBPELS without
any growth in government. Therefore, for each year of the first five
years the proposed rules are in effect, the agency has determined
the following:
<P>
1. The proposed rules do not create or eliminate a government program.
<P>
2. Implementation of the proposed rules does not require the creation
of new employee positions or the elimination of existing employee positions.
<P>
3. Implementation of the proposed rules does not require an increase
or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency.
<P>
4. The proposed rules do not require an increase or decrease in
fees paid to the agency.
<P>
5. The proposed rules do not create a new regulation. 
<P>
6. The proposed rules do not increase the number of individuals
subject to the rules' applicability. 
<P>
7. The proposed rules do not positively or adversely affect this
state's economy.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
<P>
The Board has determined that no private real property interests
are affected by the proposed rules and the proposed rules do not restrict,
limit, or impose a burden on an owner's rights to his or her private
real property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government
action. As a result, the proposed rules do not constitute a taking
or require a takings impact assessment under Government Code &#167;2007.043.
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL RULE ANALYSIS
<P>
The Board has determined that the proposed rules are not brought
with the specific intent to protect the environment or reduce risks
to human health from environmental exposure; thus, the Board asserts
the proposed rules are not a "major environmental rule," as defined
by Government Code &#167;2001.0225. As a result, the Board asserts
preparation of an environmental impact analysis, as provided by &#167;2001.0225,
is not required.
<P>

has determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed
rules are in effect, there are no estimated additional costs or reductions
in costs to state or local government as a result of enforcing or
administering the proposed rule. HB 1523 transferred regulatory authority
from TBPLS to TBPELS, and these rules merely reflect that transfer
of authority.
<P>

<P>
Dr. Kinney has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rules are in effect, there are no anticipated
economic costs to persons who are required to comply with the proposed
rules because the changes are related to agency operations as set
forth in HB 1523, Occupations Code 1001 and 1071.
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES, MICRO-BUSINESSES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES
<P>
There will be no adverse effect on small businesses, micro-businesses,
or rural communities as a result of the proposed rules. Since the
agency has determined that the proposed rules will have no adverse
economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities,
preparation of an Economic Impact Statement and a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code &#167;2006.002,
is not required.
<P>
ONE-FOR-ONE REQUIREMENT FOR RULES WITH A FISCAL IMPACT

on regulated persons, including another state agency, a special district,
or a local government. Therefore, the agency is not required to take
any further action under Government Code &#167;2001.0045.

4. The proposed rules do not require an increase or decrease in
fees paid to the agency.
<P>

<P>
6. The proposed rules do not expand, limit, or repeal a regulation,
except as provided by HB 1532, which transferred the regulation of
land surveying to the TBPELS, and these rules reflect a transfer of
that regulatory authority from the former Board of Professional Land
Surveying to the TBPELS
<P>
7. The proposed rules do not increase the number of individuals
subject to the rule's applicability. 
<P>
8. The proposed rules do not positively or adversely affect this
state's economy.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
<P>
The Board has determined that no private real property interests
are affected by the proposed rules and the proposed rules do not restrict,
limit, or impose a burden on an owner's rights to his or her private
real property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government
action. As a result, the proposed rules do not constitute a taking

<B>PART 36.<a name=70> COUNCIL ON SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT</a></B><P>
<B>CHAPTER 810.<a name=71> COUNCIL ON SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT</a></B><P>
<b>SUBCHAPTER A. LICENSED SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT PROVIDERS</b><P>
<a name=72><B>22 TAC &#167;810.4</B></a>
<P>
The Council on Sex Offender Treatment (Council) proposes an amendment to Title 22, Texas Administrative Code, &#167;810.4,
concerning License Issuance and/or Renewal, in order to provide licensed
sex offender treatment providers with the flexibility to obtain additional
online continuing education hours for renewal requirements.
<P>
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
<P>
The Council is required to adopt rules for procedures and eligibility
and other requirements for renewal of a sex offender treatment provider
license, including requirements related to continuing education.
<P>
At its regularly scheduled meeting on June 12, 2020, the Council
approved the amendment to &#167;810.4(7) to increase the maximum number
of allowable online continuing education hours for license renewal
from six hours to 12 hours. Online hours accrued to satisfy the continuing
education ethics requirement do not count toward the maximum of 12
online hours.
<P>
SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY
<P>
The proposed amendment to &#167;810.4(7) increases the maximum
number of online continuing education hours for license renewal from
six hours to 12 hours. There are no further changes to &#167;810.4.
<P>
FISCAL NOTE
<P>
Council staff has determined that for each year of the first five
years the proposed rule will be in effect, there will be no fiscal
implications to state or local governments as a result of the proposed
rule changes.
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
As required by Texas Government Code, &#167;2001.0221, relating
to government growth impact statements, Council staff has determined
that during the first five years the rule will be in effect, the proposed
rule neither creates nor eliminates a government program; implementation
of the proposed rule requires neither the creation of new employee
positions nor the elimination of existing employee positions; implementation
of the proposed rule requires neither an increase nor decrease in
future legislative appropriations to the agency; the proposed rule
requires neither an increase nor decrease in fees paid to the agency;
the proposed rule neither expands, limits, nor repeals an existing
regulation; the proposed rule neither increases nor decreases the
number of individuals subject to the rule's applicability; and the
proposed rule neither positively nor adversely affects this state's economy.
<P>
SMALL BUSINESS, MICRO-BUSINESS AND RURAL ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
<P>
Council staff has also determined there will be no adverse economic
effect on small businesses, micro-businesses or rural communities
required to comply with the section as proposed. This was determined
by interpretation of the rules that small businesses and micro-businesses
or rural communities will not be required to alter their business
practices to comply with the section. The rule does not impose any
additional costs on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities
required to comply with the rule.
<P>
IMPACT ON LOCAL EMPLOYMENT
<P>
The proposal will not affect a local economy. There is no anticipated
negative impact on local employment.
<P>
COSTS TO REGULATED PERSONS
<P>
Texas Government Code, &#167;2001.0045 does not apply to this rule
because the rule does not impose a fee on regulated persons.
<P>
PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COSTS
<P>
In addition, Council staff has also determined that for each year
of the first five years the section is in effect, the public will
benefit from adoption of the section. The public benefit anticipated
as a result of enforcing or administering the section is to continue
to ensure public health and safety through the effective licensing
and regulation of sex offender treatment providers.
<P>
Council staff has determined that there are no anticipated economic
costs to persons who are required to comply with the rule as proposed.
<P>
REGULATORY ANALYSIS
<P>
Council staff has determined this proposal is not a "major environmental
rule" as defined by Texas Government Code, &#167;2001.0225. "Major
environmental rule" is defined to mean a rule the specific intent
of which is to protect the environment or reduce risk to human health
from environmental exposure and that may adversely affect, in a material
way, the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment or the public health and safety of a state or
a sector of the state. This proposal is not specifically intended
to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
<P>
Council staff has determined the proposed rule does not restrict
or limit an owner's right to his or her property that would otherwise
exist in the absence of government action and, therefore, does not
constitute a taking under Texas Government Code, &#167;2007.043.
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENT
<P>
Comments on the proposed rule may be submitted to Sarah Faszholz,
Interim Executive Director, Council on Sex Offender Treatment, Mail

or a holiday, comments must be postmarked, shipped, or emailed before
midnight on the following business day to be considered.
<p>
