<b>SUBCHAPTER CC. COMMISSIONER'S RULES CONCERNING SCHOOL FACILITIES</b><P>
<a name=43><B>19 TAC &#167;61.1038, &#167;61.1039</B></a>
<P>
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) proposes amendments to &#167;61.1038 and &#167;61.1039, concerning bond enhancement programs
for school districts and open-enrollment charter schools. The proposed
amendments would update cross references to state and federal statute
and align language for open-enrollment charter schools to the rule
on the Bond Guarantee Program for charter schools. 
<P>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND JUSTIFICATION: Texas Education Code
(TEC), Chapter 45, Subchapter I, establishes an intercept program
to provide credit enhancement for school district bonds. Section 61.1038
sets out the statutory provisions for the intercept credit enhancement
program; provides definitions; sets out the data sources used for
prioritization of applications; explains application and approval
requirements; provides a description of how applications would be
processed; and sets out eligibility requirements, limitations on access
to the credit enhancement, financial exigency provisions, and credit
enhancement restrictions. The section also explains what effect defeasance
would have on bonds approved for credit enhancement, the responsibilities
of school districts that are unable to make payments on enhanced bonds,
how payments would be made under the program, and how the Foundation
School Program would be reimbursed for payments. In addition, the
section describes penalties for repeated failure of a district to
make payments on enhanced bonds.
<P>
TEC, Chapter 45, Subchapter J, establishes a charter school facilities
credit enhancement program to help charter holders obtain financing
to purchase, repair, or renovate real property for facilities. Section
61.1039 sets out the statutory provisions for the credit enhancement
program, provides definitions, and explains the requirements of and
policies related to the program's application and approval process.
The section also provides limitations on access to the program and
explains program payment conditions and restrictions.
<P>
House Bill 3, 86th Texas Legislature, 2019, recodified TEC, Chapter
41, to Chapter 49 and Chapter 42 to Chapter 48. The proposed amendments
to &#167;61.1038 and &#167;61.1039 would update the statutory references
to conform to the recodification. 
<P>
In addition, the amendment to &#167;61.1039 would eliminate references
to a repealed federal statute regarding tax credit bonds and make
the reference more encompassing of state or federal definitions of
debt service. The amendment would also modify the statement regarding
obligation of entities under control of the charter holder to conform
to 19 TAC &#167;33.67(e)(2)(A)(iii) relating to the Bond Guarantee
Program for charter schools.
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT: Leo Lopez, associate commissioner for school finance,
has determined that for the first five-year period the proposal is
in effect there are no additional costs to state or local government,
including school districts and open-enrollment charter schools, required
to comply with the proposal beyond what the authorizing statute requires.
<P>
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT: The proposal has no effect on local economy;
therefore, no local employment impact statement is required under
Texas Government Code, &#167;2001.022.
<P>
SMALL BUSINESS, MICROBUSINESS, AND RURAL COMMUNITY IMPACT: The
proposal has no direct adverse economic impact for small businesses,
microbusinesses, or rural communities; therefore, no regulatory flexibility
analysis, specified in Texas Government Code, &#167;2006.002, is required.
<P>
COST INCREASE TO REGULATED PERSONS: The proposal does not impose
a cost on regulated persons, another state agency, a special district,
or a local government and, therefore, is not subject to Texas Government
Code, &#167;2001.0045.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT: The proposal does not impose a burden
on private real property and, therefore, does not constitute a taking
under Texas Government Code, &#167;2007.043. 
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT: TEA staff prepared a Government Growth
Impact Statement assessment for this proposed rulemaking. During the
first five years the proposed rulemaking would be in effect, it would
not create or eliminate a government program; would not require the
creation of new employee positions or elimination of existing employee
positions; would not require an increase or decrease in future legislative
appropriations to the agency; would not require an increase or decrease
in fees paid to the agency; would not create a new regulation; would
not expand, limit, or repeal an existing regulation; would not increase
or decrease the number of individuals subject to its applicability;
and would not positively or adversely affect the state's economy.
<P>
PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COST TO PERSONS: Mr. Lopez has determined that
for each year of the first five years the proposal is in effect, the
public benefit anticipated as a result of enforcing the proposal would
be the reflection of correct state and federal statutory references
and clarification for open-enrollment charter schools on the implementation
of the Bond Enhancement Program for charter schools. There is no anticipated
economic cost to persons who are required to comply with the proposal.
<P>
DATA AND REPORTING IMPACT: The proposal would have no data and
reporting impact.
<P>
PRINCIPAL AND CLASSROOM TEACHER PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS: TEA has
determined that the proposal would not require a written report or
other paperwork to be completed by a principal or classroom teacher.
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENTS: The public comment period on the proposal begins
August 7, 2020, and ends September 21, 2020. A request for a public
hearing on the proposal submitted under the Administrative Procedure
Act must be received by the commissioner of education not more than
14 calendar days after notice of the proposal has been published in
the <I>Texas Register</I> on August 7, 2020.

TEC, &#167;45.263, which gives the commissioner authority to adopt

and procedures substantially similar to the program for school districts;
TEC, &#167;45.303, which gives the commissioner authority to limit
participation to charter schools that meet standards established by
