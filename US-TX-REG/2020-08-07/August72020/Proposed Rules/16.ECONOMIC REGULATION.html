<B>PART 4.<a name=34> TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATION</a></B><P>
<B>CHAPTER 75.<a name=35> AIR CONDITIONING AND REFRIGERATION</a></B><P>
<a name=36><B>16 TAC &#167;75.110</B></a>
<P>
The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation
(Department) proposes amendments to an existing rule at 16 Texas Administrative
Code (TAC), Chapter 75, &#167;75.110, regarding the Air Conditioning
and Refrigeration Program. These proposed changes are referred to
as the "proposed rule."
<P>
EXPLANATION OF AND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RULE
<P>
The rules under 16 TAC, Chapter 75, implement Texas Occupations
Code, Chapter 1302, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractors.
<P>
The Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Contractor License Law,
Tex. Occ. Code &#167;1302.101(a), requires the Commission to adopt
rules for the practice of air conditioning and refrigeration contracting
that are at least as strict as the standards provided by the Uniform
Mechanical Code and the International Mechanical Code. These codes
define the standard of practice for air conditioning and refrigeration
contracting and are used by Department staff to evaluate the mechanical
integrity and proper installation and service of air conditioning
and refrigeration systems. The proposed amendments are necessary to
align the program's applicable codes with currently recognized national
standards and to provide clarity and consistency for the Department's licensees.
<P>
The proposed rule updates the applicable code editions from 2015
to 2018 for the International Residential Code, International Mechanical
Code, International Fuel Gas Code, and Uniform Mechanical Code. The
proposed rule also adopts by reference the edition of the International
Energy Conservation Code (IECC) adopted by the State Energy Conservation
Office pursuant to Chapter 388 of the Texas Health and Safety Code
and 34 TAC &#167;19.53. As of the time of this writing, the State
Energy Conservation Office has adopted the 2015 edition of the IECC.
<P>
The proposed rule was presented to and discussed by the Air Conditioning
and Refrigeration Contractors Advisory Board at its meeting on July
15, 2020. The Advisory Board did not make any changes to the proposed
rule. The Advisory Board voted and recommended that the proposed rule
be published in the <I>Texas Register</I> for public comment.
<P>
SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY
<P>
The proposed rule amends &#167;75.110(a) to adopt the 2018 editions
of the International Residential Code, International Mechanical Code,
International Fuel Gas Code, and Uniform Mechanical Code. Proposed
&#167;75.110(a) also adopts the edition of the IECC adopted by the
State Energy Conservation Office pursuant to Chapter 388 of the Texas
Health and Safety Code.
<P>
The proposed rule amends subsection (b) to state that the currently
adopted code editions will remain in effect through December 31, 2020.
Further, proposed subsection (b) states that air conditioning and
refrigeration work permitted or begun before January 1, 2021 may be
performed in accordance with the 2015 edition of the applicable codes.
<P>
The other proposed amendments remove outdated or unnecessary language
from the rule.
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
<P>
Tony Couvillon, Policy Research and Budget Analyst, has determined
that for each year of the first five years the proposed rule is in
effect, there are no estimated additional costs or reductions in costs
to state or local government as a result of enforcing or administering
the proposed rule.
<P>
Mr. Couvillon has determined that for each year of the first five
years the proposed rule is in effect, there is no estimated increase
or loss in revenue to the state or local government as a result of
enforcing or administering the proposed rule.
<P>
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Mr. Couvillon has determined that the proposed rule will not affect
the local economy, so the agency is not required to prepare a local
employment impact statement under Government Code &#167;2001.022.
<P>
PUBLIC BENEFITS
<P>
Mr. Couvillon has also determined that for each year of the first
five-year period the proposed rule is in effect, the public benefit
will be consistency in the health and safety, installation, and maintenance
requirements for air conditioning and refrigeration work performed
in Texas.
<P>
PROBABLE ECONOMIC COSTS TO PERSONS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSAL
<P>
Mr. Couvillon has determined that for each year of the first five-year
period the proposed rule is in effect, there may be some economic
costs to persons, including small or micro-businesses, required to
comply with the proposed rule. However, adoption of the updated codes
may also result in cost savings for licensees and customers. The Department
is unable to provide an estimate of costs or cost savings attributable
to the updated codes, as those costs or cost savings will be determined
by the market for air conditioning and refrigeration services.
<P>
FISCAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES, MICRO-BUSINESSES, AND RURAL COMMUNITIES
<P>
There will be no adverse economic effect on small businesses, micro-businesses,
or rural communities as a result of the proposed rule. Since the agency
has determined that the proposed rule will have no adverse economic
effect on small businesses, micro-businesses, or rural communities,
preparation of an Economic Impact Statement and a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code &#167;2006.002,
is not required.
<P>
ONE-FOR-ONE REQUIREMENT FOR RULES WITH A FISCAL IMPACT
<P>
The proposed rule does not have a fiscal note that imposes a cost
on regulated persons, including another state agency, a special district,
or a local government. Therefore, the agency is not required to take
any further action under Government Code &#167;2001.0045.
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Pursuant to Government Code &#167;2001.0221, the agency provides
the following Government Growth Impact Statement for the proposed
rule. For each year of the first five years the proposed rule will
be in effect, the agency has determined the following:
<P>
1. The proposed rule does not create or eliminate a government program.
<P>
2. Implementation of the proposed rule does not require the creation
of new employee positions or the elimination of existing employee positions.
<P>
3. Implementation of the proposed rule does not require an increase
or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency.
<P>
4. The proposed rule does not require an increase or decrease in
fees paid to the agency.
<P>
5. The proposed rule does not create a new regulation.
<P>
6. The proposed rule does not expand, limit, or repeal an existing regulation.
<P>
7. The proposed rule does not increase or decrease the number of
individuals subject to the rule's applicability.
<P>
8. The proposed rule does not positively or adversely affect this
state's economy.
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT ASSESSMENT
<P>
The Department has determined that no private real property interests
are affected by the proposed rule and the proposed rule does not restrict,
limit, or impose a burden on an owner's rights to his or her private
real property that would otherwise exist in the absence of government
action. As a result, the proposed rule does not constitute a taking
or require a takings impact assessment under Government Code &#167;2007.043.
<P>

<B>PART 8.</B>
<a name=37><B>TEXAS RACING COMMISSION</B><P>
<B>CHAPTER 323.<a name=38> DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND ENFORCEMENT</a></B>
<P>
The Texas Racing Commission ("the Commission") proposes amendments
to 16 TAC &#167;323.101, Administrative Penalties, and &#167;313.201,
Reporting of Criminal Activity and Convictions. The proposed amendments
to &#167;323.101 would delete text that is duplicative of a provision
in the Texas Racing Act ("Act") and would update a reference to a
section of the Act to refer to the Occupations Code instead of Vernon's
Civil Statutes. The proposed amendments to &#167;323.201 would delete
an outdated reference to Vernon's Texas Codes Annotated.
<P>
FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
<P>
Chuck Trout, Executive Director, has determined that for the first
five-year period the amendments are in effect, there will be no fiscal
implications for local or state government as a result of enforcing
the amendments. Enforcing or administering the amendments does not
have foreseeable implications relating to cost or revenues of the
state or local governments.
<P>
ANTICIPATED PUBLIC BENEFIT AND COST
<P>
Mr. Trout has determined that for each year of the first five years
that the amendments are in effect, the anticipated public benefit
will be clarity of these provisions. There is no probable economic
cost to persons required to comply with the amendments.
<P>
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Mr. Trout has determined that the proposed amendments will not
adversely affect the local economy, so the agency is not required
to prepare a local employment impact statement under Government Code &#167;2001.022.
<P>
GOVERNMENT GROWTH IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
For each year of the first five years that the proposed amendments
are in effect, the government growth impact is as follows: the amendments
do not create or eliminate a government program; the amendments do
not create any new employee positions or eliminate any existing employee
positions; implementation of the amendments does not require an increase
or decrease in future legislative appropriations to the agency; the
amendments do not require an increase or decrease in fees paid to
the agency; the amendments do not create new regulations; the amendments
do not expand existing regulations; the amendments do not repeal existing
regulations; the amendments do not increase or decrease the number
of individuals subject to the rule's applicability; and the amendments
are not expected to have an adverse effect on this state's economy.
<P>
EFFECT ON SMALL AND MICRO-BUSINESSES
<P>
The proposed amendments will have no adverse economic effect on
small or micro-businesses, and therefore preparation of an economic
impact statement and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.
<P>
IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS
<P>
There are no negative impacts upon employment conditions in this
state as a result of the proposed amendments.
<P>
ADVERSE ECONOMIC EFFECT ON RURAL COMMUNITIES
<P>
There will be no adverse effect on rural communities as a result
of the proposed amendments. Because the agency has determined that
the proposed amendments will have no adverse economic effect on rural
communities, preparation of an Economic Impact Statement and a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis, as detailed under Texas Government Code &#167;2006.002,
is not required.
<P>
REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL RULES
<P>
Mr. Trout has determined that these proposed amendments do not
constitute a "major environmental rule" as defined by Government Code,
&#167;2001.0225. Accordingly, an environmental impact analysis is
not required. 
<P>
TAKINGS IMPACT STATEMENT
<P>
Mr. Trout has determined that the proposed amendments will not
affect private real property and will not restrict, limit, or impose
a burden on an owner's right to his or her private real property and,
therefore, will not constitute a taking. As a result, a takings impact
assessment is not required, as provided by Government Code &#167;2007.043.
<P>
EFFECT ON AGRICULTURAL, HORSE, AND GREYHOUND 
INDUSTRIES
<P>
The proposed amendments will not have an adverse effect on the
state's agricultural, horse breeding, horse training, greyhound breeding,
or greyhound training industries.
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENTS
<P>
All comments or questions regarding the proposed amendments may
be submitted in writing within 30 days following publication of this
notice in the <I>Texas Register</I> by mail
