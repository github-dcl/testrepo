<a name=2><b>Proclamation 41-3752</b></a>
<P>
<B>TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME:</B>
<P>
WHEREAS, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, issued a disaster proclamation
on March 13, 2020, certifying under Section 418.014 of the Texas Government
Code that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) poses an imminent threat
of disaster for all counties in the State of Texas; and
<P>
WHEREAS, in each subsequent month effective through today, I have
renewed the disaster declaration for all Texas counties; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health
Services, Dr. John Hellerstedt, has determined that COVID-19 continues
to represent a public health disaster within the meaning of Chapter
81 of the Texas Health and Safety Code; and
<P>
WHEREAS, pursuant to legislative authorization under Chapter 418
of the Texas Government Code, I have issued executive orders, proclamations,
and suspensions of Texas laws in response to the COVID-19 disaster,
aimed at using the least restrictive means available to protect the
health and safety of Texans and ensure an effective response to this
disaster; and
<P>
WHEREAS, Section 41.001(a) of the Texas Election Code provides
that a general or special election in this state shall be held on
a uniform election date, and the next uniform election date is occurring
on November 3, 2020; and
<P>
WHEREAS, I issued a proclamation on March 18, 2020, suspending
Sections 41.0052(a) and (b) of the Texas Election Code and Section
49.103 of the Texas Water Code to the extent necessary to allow political
subdivisions that would otherwise have held elections on May 2, 2020,
to move their general and special elections for 2020 only to the November
3, 2020, uniform election date; and
<P>
WHEREAS, Texas law provides that eligible voters have a right to
cast a vote in person; and
<P>
WHEREAS, as counties across Texas prepare for the upcoming elections
on November 3, 2020, and establish procedures for eligible voters
to exercise their right to vote in person, it is necessary that election
officials implement health protocols to conduct elections safely and
to protect election workers and voters; and
<P>
WHEREAS, in order to ensure that elections proceed efficiently
and safely when Texans go to the polls to cast a vote in person during
early voting or on election day for the November 3, 2020, elections,
it is necessary to increase the number of days in which polling locations
will be open during the early voting period, such that election officials
can implement appropriate social distancing and safe hygiene practices; and
<P>
WHEREAS, Section 85.001(a) of the Texas Election Code provides
that the period for early voting by personal appearance begins 17
days before election day; and
<P>
WHEREAS, Section 86.006(a-1) of the Texas Election Code provides
that a voter may deliver a marked mail ballot in person to the early
voting clerk's office while the polls are open on election day; and
<P>
WHEREAS, in consultation with the Texas Secretary of State, it
has become apparent that for the November 3, 2020, elections, strict
compliance with the statutory requirements in Sections 85.001(a) and
86.006(a-1) of the Texas Election Code would prevent, hinder, or delay
necessary action in coping with the COVID-19 disaster, and that providing
additional time for early voting will provide Texans greater safety
while voting in person; and
<P>
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 418.016 of the Texas Government Code,
the legislature has expressly authorized the Governor to suspend the
provisions of any regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for
conduct of state business or the orders or rules of a state agency
if strict compliance with the provisions, orders, or rules would in
any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with
a disaster;
<P>
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GREG ABBOTT, Governor of Texas, under the authority
vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas, do
hereby suspend Section 85.001(a) of the Texas Election Code to the
extent necessary to require that, for any election ordered or authorized
to occur on November 3, 2020, early voting by personal appearance
shall begin on Tuesday, October 13, 2020, and shall continue through
the fourth day before election day. I further suspend Section 86.006(a-1)
of the Texas Election Code, for any election ordered or authorized
to occur on November 3, 2020, to the extent necessary to allow a voter
to deliver a marked mail ballot in person to the early voting clerk's
office prior to and including on election day.
<P>
The Secretary of State shall take notice of this proclamation and
shall transmit a copy of this order immediately to every County Judge
of this state and all appropriate writs will be issued and all proper
proceedings will be followed to the end that said elections may be
held and their results proclaimed in accordance with law.
<P>
IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereto signed my name and have officially
caused the Seal of State to be affixed at my office in the City of
Austin, Texas, this the 27th day of July, 2020.

<P>
<B>TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME:</B>
<P>
WHEREAS, I, GREG ABBOTT, Governor of the State of Texas, do hereby
certify that the severe weather from Hurricane Hanna, which began
on July 25, 2020, poses a threat of imminent disaster, including property
damage and loss of life, due to widespread flooding, storm surge,

Section 418.014 of the Texas Government Code, I do hereby declare
a state of disaster in the previously listed counties;
<P>
Pursuant to Section 418.017 of the code, I authorize the use of
all available resources of state government and of political subdivisions
that are reasonably necessary to cope with this disaster.
<P>
Pursuant to Section 418.016 of the code, any regulatory statute
prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business or any order
or rule of a state agency that would in any way prevent, hinder, or
delay necessary action in coping with this disaster shall be suspended
upon written approval of the Office of the Governor. However, to the
extent that the enforcement of any state statute or administrative
rule regarding contracting or procurement would impede any state agency's
emergency response that is necessary to protect life or property threatened
by this declared disaster, I hereby authorize the suspension of such
statutes and rules for the duration of this declared disaster.
<P>
In accordance with the statutory requirements, copies of this proclamation
shall be filed with the applicable authorities.
<P>
IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto signed my name and have officially
caused the Seal of State to be affixed at my office in the City of
Austin, Texas, this the 25th day of July, 2020.
