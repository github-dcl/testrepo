<a name=126><b>Notice of Public Meeting on Proposed Remedial Action</b></a>
<P>
Notice of a virtual public meeting on September 17, 2020, concerning
the proposed remedial action at the McBay Oil and Gas state Superfund
site in Grapeland, Texas (the site).
<P>
The public meeting will be held for the purpose of obtaining additional
information regarding the facility and the identification of additional
potentially responsible parties and to invite public comment concerning
the proposed remedy for the site. The public meeting is not a contested
case hearing under the Texas Government Code, Chapter 2001.
<P>
The executive director (ED) of the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ) issues this public notice of the proposed remedy for
the site. In accordance with Texas Health and Safety Code, &#167;361.187
and 30 Texas Administrative Code &#167;335.349(a), a public meeting
regarding the TCEQ's selection of a proposed remedy for the site shall
be held. This notice was also published in the Grapeland Messenger
and the Houston County Courier on August 6, 2020. 
<P>
This meeting was originally scheduled for April 9, 2020, but was
postponed. On March 16, 2020, in accordance with Texas Government
Code, &#167;418.016, Governor Abbott suspended various provisions
of the Open Meetings Act that require government officials and members
of the public to be physically present at a specified meeting location.
Pursuant to that suspension, the public will not be able to attend
the public meeting in person but may attend via the Microsoft Live
application at no cost.
<P>
The public meeting will be held on September 17, 2020, at 6:00
p.m. This public meeting can be accessed through a Microsoft Live
link and access code. Both the link, access code, and reference documents
for the public meeting will be available by August 7, 2020 at the
TCEQ's website, accessible at https://www.tceq.texas.gov/remediation/superfund/state/mcbay.html. 
<P>
The site was proposed for listing on the state registry of Superfund
sites in the July 25, 1986, issue of the <I>Texas
Register</I> (11 TexReg 3421) and listed on the state registry
of Superfund sites in the January 16, 1987, issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (12 TexReg 205). On August
12, 1999, commercial/industrial land use was selected for remediation
of the site. 
<P>
The site is located on Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 1272, two miles
west of the intersection with FM 2968 (North Olive Street), Grapeland,
Texas, in a rural area of Houston County. The site is approximately
20 acres in size. A facility operated on the site until 1987, and
at different times was an oil processing facility, an oil refinery,
and an oil reclamation facility. 
<P>
The TCEQ completed its investigation of the site and documented
the results in an Affected Property Assessment Report. Groundwater
contamination consisting of total petroleum hydrocarbons and several
aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants is present on- and off-site in the
uppermost groundwater-bearing unit, the Sparta Formation, which occurs
approximately 22 to 50 feet below the ground surface. 
<P>
The TCEQ has also completed a Focused Feasibility Study that evaluated
remedial alternatives for remediating the site groundwater according
to the Texas Risk Reduction Program (TRRP) rules. The process used
to evaluate the remedial alternatives and the proposed remedy are
documented in the Proposed Remedial Action Document (PRAD), which
is available at the TCEQ's website, accessible at https://www.tceq.texas.gov/remediation/superfund/state/mcbay.html.
The proposed remedy is an on- and off-site Plume Management Zone (PMZ).
The PMZ will be established with institutional controls filed in county
real property records in accordance with TRRP. Institutional controls
will remain in place until it is demonstrated that chemicals of concern
in groundwater no longer exceed the applicable Protective Concentration Levels. 
<P>
All persons desiring to comment may do so prior to or at the meeting.
All comments submitted prior to the meeting must be received by 5:00
p.m. on September 16, 2020,<B> and should be sent

<a name=135><b>Notice to Public and to All Interested Mortgage Lenders Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs Mortgage Credit Certificate Program</b></a>
<P>
The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (the "Department")
intends to implement a Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (the "Program")
to assist eligible very low, low, and moderate income first-time homebuyers
with the purchase of a residence located within the State of Texas.
Under the Program, a first-time homebuyer who satisfies the eligibility
requirements described herein may receive a federal income tax credit
in an amount equal to the product of the certificate credit rate established
under the Program and the interest paid or accrued by the homeowner
during the taxable year on the remaining principal of the certified
indebtedness amount incurred by the homeowner to acquire the principal
residence of the homeowner; provided that, if the certificate credit
rate established under the Program exceeds 20%, the amount of such
credit allowed in any taxable year may not exceed $2,000. In order
to qualify to receive a mortgage credit certificate, the homebuyer
must qualify for a conventional, FHA, VA, USDA or other home mortgage
loan from a lending institution and must meet the other requirements
of the Program. 
<P>
The mortgage credit certificates will be issued to qualified mortgagors
on a first-come, first-served basis by the Department, which will
review applications from lending institutions and prospective mortgagors
to determine compliance with the requirements of the Program and determine
that mortgage credit certificates remain available under the Program.
No mortgage credit certificates will be issued prior to ninety (90)
days from the date of publication of this notice or after the date
that all of the credit certificate amount has been allocated to homebuyers,
and in no event will mortgage credit certificates be issued later
than the date permitted by federal tax law.
<P>
In order to satisfy the eligibility requirements for a mortgage
credit certificate under the Program: (a) the prospective residence
must be a single-family residence located within the State of Texas
that can be reasonably expected to become the principal residence
of the mortgagor within a reasonable period of time after the financing
is provided; (b) the prospective homebuyer's current income must not
exceed, (1) for families of three or more persons, 115% (140% in certain
targeted areas or in certain cases permitted under applicable provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) of
the area median income; and (2) for individuals and families of two
persons, 100% (120% in certain targeted areas or in certain cases
permitted under applicable provisions of the Code) of the area median
income; (c) the prospective homebuyer must not have owned a home as
a principal residence during the past three years (except in the case
of certain targeted area residences or in certain cases permitted
under applicable provisions of the Code); (d) the acquisition cost
of the residence must not exceed 90% (110%, in the case of certain
targeted area residences or in certain cases permitted under applicable
provisions of the Code) of the average area purchase price applicable
to the residence; and (e) no part of the proceeds of the qualified
indebtedness may be used to acquire or replace an existing mortgage
(except in certain cases permitted under applicable provisions of
the Code). To obtain additional information on the Program, including
the boundaries of current targeted areas, as well as the current income
and purchase price limits (which are subject to revision and adjustment
from time to time by the Department pursuant to changes in applicable
federal law and Department policy), please contact Cathy Gutierrez
at the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, 221 East
11th Street, Austin, Texas 78701-2410; telephone (512) 475-0277.
<P>
The Department intends to maintain a list of single family mortgage
lenders that will participate in the Program by making loans to qualified
holders of these mortgage credit certificates. Any lender interested
in appearing on this list or in obtaining additional information regarding
the Program should contact Cathy Gutierrez at the Texas Department
of Housing and Community Affairs, 221 East 11th Street, Austin, Texas
78701-2410; (512) 475-0277. The Department may schedule a meeting
with lenders to discuss in greater detail the requirements of the Program.
<P>
This notice is published in satisfaction of the requirements of
Section 25 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.25-3T(j)(4)
and 1.25-4T promulgated thereunder regarding the public notices prerequisite

Ticket presented for payment; or
<P>

pending payment of the claim.
<P>

sign the back of the Scratch Ticket in the space designated on the
Scratch Ticket and may present the winning Scratch Ticket to any Texas
Lottery Retailer. The Texas Lottery Retailer shall verify the claim
and, if valid, and upon presentation of proper identification, if

void the Scratch Ticket; provided that the Texas Lottery Retailer
may, but is not required, to pay a $30.00, $40.00, $50.00, $100, $200
or $400 Scratch Ticket Game. In the event the Texas Lottery Retailer
cannot verify the claim, the Texas Lottery Retailer shall provide
the claimant with a claim form and instruct the claimant on how to
file a claim with the Texas Lottery. If the claim is validated by
the Texas Lottery, a check shall be forwarded to the claimant in the
amount due. In the event the claim is not validated, the claim shall
be denied and the claimant shall be notified promptly. A claimant
may also claim any of the above prizes under the procedure described

the claim is validated by the Texas Lottery, payment will be made
to the bearer of the validated winning Scratch Ticket for that prize
upon presentation of proper identification. When paying a prize of
$600 or more, the Texas Lottery shall file the appropriate income
reporting form with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and shall withhold
federal income tax at a rate set by the IRS if required. In the event
that the claim is not validated by the Texas Lottery, the claim shall
be denied and the claimant shall be notified promptly.
<P>

Ticket Game prize the claimant may submit the signed winning Scratch
Ticket and a thoroughly completed claim form via mail. If a prize
value is $1,000,000 or more, the claimant must also provide proof
of Social Security number or Tax Payer Identification (for U.S. Citizens
or Resident Aliens). Mail all to: Texas Lottery Commission, P.O. Box
16600, Austin, Texas 78761-6600. The Texas Lottery is not responsible
for Scratch Tickets lost in the mail. In the event that the claim
is not validated by the Texas Lottery, the claim shall be denied and
the claimant shall be notified promptly.

C. if there is any question regarding the validity of the Scratch
Ticket presented for payment; or
<P>
D. if the claim is subject to any deduction from the payment otherwise
due, as described in Section 2.3.D of these Game Procedures. No liability
for interest for any delay shall accrue to the benefit of the claimant
pending payment of the claim.
<P>

of a Scratch Ticket in the space designated, a Scratch Ticket shall
be owned by the physical possessor of said Scratch Ticket. When a
signature is placed on the back of the Scratch Ticket in the space
designated, the player whose signature appears in that area shall
be the owner of the Scratch Ticket and shall be entitled to any prize
attributable thereto. Notwithstanding any name or names submitted
on a claim form, the Executive Director shall make payment to the
player whose signature appears on the back of the Scratch Ticket in
the space designated. If more than one name appears on the back of
the Scratch Ticket, the Executive Director will require that one of
those players whose name appears thereon be designated by such players
to receive payment.
