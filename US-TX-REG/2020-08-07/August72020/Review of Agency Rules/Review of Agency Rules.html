<B>Title 1, Part 12</B>
<P>
The Commission on State Emergency Communications (CSEC) is conducting
its annual review of the definitions of the terms "local exchange
access line" and "equivalent local exchange access line" as required
by Health and Safety Code &#167;771.063(c). Due to the potentially
disruptive changes resulting from advancements in technology, particularly
with respect to mobile Internet Protocol-enabled services, CSEC takes
no position on whether current &#167;255.4 sufficiently defines the
foregoing terms.
<P>
Persons wishing to comment on CSEC's initial determination or recommend
amendments to &#167;255.4 may do so by submitting written comments
within 30 days following publication of this notice in the <I>Texas Register</I> to Patrick Tyler, General
Counsel, Commission on State Emergency Communications, 333 Guadalupe
Street, Suite 2-212, Austin, Texas 78701-3942; by facsimile to (512)
305-6937; or by email to patrick.tyler@csec.texas.gov. Please include
"Comments on Rule 255.4" in the subject line of your letter, fax,
or email. Any proposed changes to &#167;255.4 will be published in
the Proposed Rules Section of the <I>Texas Register
</I> and will be open for an additional 30-day public comment period.
