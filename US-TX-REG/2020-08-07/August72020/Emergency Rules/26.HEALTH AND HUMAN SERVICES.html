<b>SUBCHAPTER Z. EMERGENCY RULEMAKING</b><P>
<a name=12><B>26 TAC &#167;306.1351</B></a>
<P>
The Executive Commissioner of the Health and Human
Services Commission (HHSC) adopts on an emergency basis in Title 26,
Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 306, Behavioral Health Delivery
System, new Subchapter Z, Emergency Rulemaking, &#167;306.1351, concerning
an emergency rule in response to COVID-19 in order to reduce the risk
of transmission of COVID-19. As authorized by Government Code, &#167;2001.034,
the Commission may adopt an emergency rule without prior notice or
hearing if it finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety,
or welfare requires adoption on fewer than 30 days' notice. Emergency
rules adopted under Government Code, &#167;2001.034, may be effective
for not longer than 120 days and may be renewed for not longer than
60 days.
<P>
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
<P>
The purpose of the emergency rulemaking is to support the Governor's
March 13, 2020, proclamation certifying that the COVID-19 virus poses
an imminent threat of disaster in the state and declaring a state
of disaster for all counties in Texas. In this proclamation, the Governor
authorized the use of all available resources of state government
and of political subdivisions that are reasonably necessary to cope
with this disaster and directed that government entities and businesses
would continue providing essential services. The Commission accordingly
finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, and welfare
of the state requires immediate adoption of these emergency rules
for Behavioral Health Services in response to COVID-19.
<P>
To protect individuals receiving mental health services and the
public health, safety, and welfare of the state during the COVID-19
pandemic, HHSC is adopting an emergency rule to establish flexibility
of certain requirements to: allow alternative methods other than face-to-face
contact or in-person interactions, such as the use of telehealth,
telemedicine, video-conferencing, or telephonic methods; allow virtual
platforms instead of a private physical space for certain in-person
interactions, such as the use of a telephone or video-conferencing;
and allow a child or adolescent participating in the YES Waiver Program
to reside with another responsible adult as the child or adolescent
may not be residing with his or her legally authorized representative
due to COVID-19.
<p>
STATUTORY AUTHORITY
<P>
The emergency rulemaking is adopted under Government Code, &#167;2001.034
and &#167;531.005 and Health and Safety Code &#167;&#167;533.014,
533.035, 533.0356, 534.052, 534.058, 572.0025, 571.006, and 577.010.
Government Code &#167;2001.034 authorizes the adoption of emergency
rules without prior notice and hearing, if an agency finds that an
imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare requires adoption
of a rule on fewer than 30 days' notice; and Government Code, &#167;531.0055,
authorizes the Executive Commissioner of the Health and Human Services
Commission to adopt rules and policies necessary for the operation
and provision of health and human services by health and human services
system. Health and Safety Code &#167;533.014 requires the Executive
Commissioner of HHSC to adopt rules regarding certain responsibilities
for LMHAs; &#167;533.035 authorizes HHSC to contract with LMHAs for
the delivery of mental health services; &#167;533.0356 allows the
Executive Commissioner of HHSC to adopt rules governing Local Behavioral
Health Authorities (LBHAs); &#167;534.052 authorizes the Executive
Commissioner of HHSC to adopt rules to ensure the adequate provision
of community-based mental health services; &#167;534.058 authorizes
the Executive Commissioner to develop standards of care for services
provided by LMHAs and their subcontractor; &#167;572.0025 authorizes
the Executive Commissioner of HHSC to adopt rules governing the voluntary
admission of a patient to an inpatient mental health facility; &#167;571.006
authorizes the Executive Commissioner to adopt rules to ensure the
proper and efficient treatment of persons with mental illness; and &#167;577.010
authorizes the Executive Commissioner to adopt rules to ensure the
proper care and treatment of patients in a private mental hospital
or mental health facility.
<P>
The emergency rule implements Government Code &#167;531.0055 and
Health and Safety Code &#167;&#167;533.014, 533.035, 533.0356, 534.052,
534.058, 572.0025, 571.006, and 77.010.

by and does not conflict with other law or obligation of the provider.
Providers must ensure the selected method of contact complies with
all applicable requirements related to security and privacy of information.
