<B>PART 17.<a name=104> TEXAS STATE BOARD OF PLUMBING EXAMINERS</a></B><P>
<B>CHAPTER 361.<a name=105> ADMINISTRATION</a></B><P>
<b>SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS</b><P>
<a name=106><B>22 TAC &#167;361.1</B></a>
<P>
The Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners (Board)
adopts amendments to 22 Texas Administrative Code &#167;361.1 without
changes to the proposed text as published in the May 22, 2020, issue
of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 3730).
The rule will not be republished.
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION
<P>
The amendment to &#167;361.1, concerning definitions, indicates
that although cleaning a drain or sewer line constitutes "service"
of plumbing (and therefore the act of plumbing), inspection, alone,
of a drain, of a sewer line, or of other plumbing, using a scope or
camera, does not constitute the service of plumbing or the act of
plumbing. The adopted rule clarifies the definition of plumbing and
is consistent with Texas Occupations Code chapter 1301.
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENT
<P>
The Board published the proposed amendments to 22 Texas Administrative
Code &#167;361.1 in the May 22, 2020, issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 3730). No comments
were received. A public hearing in accordance with Texas Government
Code &#167;2001.029 was not required.
<p>
STATUTORY AUTHORITY
<P>
Amended &#167;361.1 is adopted under the authority of &#167;1301.251(2)
of the Texas Occupations Code, which requires the Board to adopt and
enforce rules necessary to administer and enforce chapter 1301 of
the Occupations Code (Plumbing License Law) and under the authority
of, and to implement Plumbing License Law &#167;1301.002(7), concerning
definitions. This adoption affects the Plumbing License Law.

adoption and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

<B>CHAPTER 367.<a name=107> ENFORCEMENT</a></B><P>
<a name=108><B>22 TAC &#167;367.10</B></a>
<P>
The Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners (Board)
adopts amendments to 22 Texas Administrative Code &#167;367.10 without
changes to the proposed text as published in the June 5, 2020, issue
of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 3730).
The rule will not be republished.
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION
<P>
The amendment to &#167;367.10 states when a plumbing company must
disclose the license information of the Master Plumber acting as the
Responsible Master Plumber (RMP) for the company and requires that
documents including proposals, invoices, and contracts inform the
public of the Board's regulatory authority and provide Board contact
information. The rule eliminates the requirement to display an RMP's
certificate of licensure in the place of business and stringent requirements
including the font size of text in invoices, proposals, and other
contracts. With respect to advertising, the proposed amendments make
changes to modernize the rule and account for changes in technology,
such as the Internet and digital advertising platforms, and changes
in the marketplace such as the proliferation of franchisor/franchisee
relationships. The amendment will expand the advertising and promotional
activities expressly deemed to be exempt from the rule's requirements,
thereby limiting existing regulations.
<P>
