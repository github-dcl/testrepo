<B>CHAPTER 251.<a name=78> 9-1-1 SERVICE--STANDARDS</a></B><P>
<a name=79><B>1 TAC &#167;251.1</B></a>
<P>
The Commission on State Emergency Communications
(CSEC) adopts amended &#167;251.1, concerning Regional Planning Commission
(RPC) strategic planning, without changes to the proposed text as
published for comment in the June 5, 2020, issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 3711). The adopted
rule will not be republished.
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION
<P>
Amended &#167;251.1 implements Health and Safety Code &#167;771.055
requirement for an RPC to submit for CSEC approval a regional strategic
plan describing how 9-1-1 service is to be administered in the RPC's
region, including at a minimum how money allocated to the RPC is to
be allocated in the region; projected financial operating information
for the two state fiscal years following the submission of the plan;
and strategic planning information for the five state fiscal years
following submission of the plan.
<P>
As amended, &#167;251.1 disentangles CSEC strategic planning policy
in the rule from the details of implementing such policy and addresses
requirements--including those demanded by changes in technology, reporting,
etc.--at a higher, policy level that is technology neutral. Reflecting
these changes is the rule's replacement of specific public safety
answering point (PSAP) requirements with the requirement to include
a PSAP Network plan and the addition of new plan requirements for
an information security program, plans for call routing/local monitoring/capital
assets/database/equipment, Text-to-911 service, and financial reporting.
The specific details and instructions for submitting or amending a
regional strategic plan are included in CSEC Program Policy Statements.
As a result, the amended rule is considerably shorter, with most changes
being deletions of text and revising the outline schema to reconcile
with the deletions.

<a name=80><B>1 TAC &#167;251.3</B></a>
<P>
The Commission on State Emergency Communications
(CSEC) adopts amended &#167;251.3, concerning a Regional Planning
Commission (RPC) requests for Use of Revenue, without changes to the
proposed text as published for comment in the June 5, 2020, issue
of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 3713).
The adopted rule will not be republished. 
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION
<P>
Amended &#167;251.3 implements Health and Safety Code &#167;&#167;771.075,
771.0751, and 771.0751 regarding the use of CSEC-allocated 9-1-1 service
fees and equalization surcharge by an RPC in its largest county/county
with at least one million population. The amendments clarify in &#167;251.3(a)
that an RPC's use of revenue is limited to the amount of unexpended
and unencumbered allocated grant funds from 9-1-1 service fees (wireline/VoIP,
wireless, and prepaid wireless) and equalization surcharge remitted
to the Comptroller of Public Accounts from the RPC's service region
for the fiscal year use of revenue is requested. Allocated grant funds
exceeding an RPC's 9-1-1 service fee and equalization surcharge revenues
are not eligible for use of revenue. 
<P>
Amended &#167;251.3(a) also clarifies that allocated grant funds
remitted from an RPC's 9-1-1 service region are expended and encumbered
first before any other source of funding of an RPC's grant--including
grant funds allocated from General Revenue Dedicated (GRD) fund balances.
<P>
As amended, &#167;251.3 will result in CSEC lapsing 9-1-1 service
appropriations back to the Texas Treasury GRD accounts equal to any
remaining unexpended and unencumbered RPC grant amounts funded from
GRD account balances. 
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENT AND AGENCY RESPONSE

<B>CHAPTER 254.<a name=81> REGIONAL POISON CONTROL CENTERS</a></B><P>
<a name=82><B>1 TAC &#167;254.2</B></a>
<P>
The Commission on State Emergency Communications
(CSEC) adopts amended &#167;254.2, concerning the establishment and
governance of CSEC's Poison Control Coordinating Committee (PCCC),
without changes to the proposed text as published for comment in the
June 5, 2020, issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45
TexReg 3715). The adopted rule will not be republished.
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION
<P>
Amended &#167;254.2 is primarily adopted to extend the duration
of the PCCC to September 1, 2023. As amended, the rule also incorporates
by reference new coordinating, partnering, and evaluation activities
recently adopted by CSEC in the PCCC bylaws; changes the requirement
of quarterly reporting by the PCCC to a September 1 of each year annual
report; and makes conforming changes for clarification.
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENT AND AGENCY RESPONSE
<P>
CSEC received no comments on proposed amended &#167;254.2.
<p>
STATUTORY AUTHORITY
<P>
The amended section is adopted under Health and Safety Code &#167;777.008
and Government Code Chapter 2110. The former establishes the PCCC
and the latter requires state agencies to describe by rule an advisory
committee's purpose and tasks, the manner in which the Committee reports
to CSEC, and the duration of the Committee.
<P>
No other statutes, articles, or codes are affected by the adoption.
<p>
The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the
adoption and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

<B>PART 15.<a name=83> TEXAS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION</a></B><P>
<B>CHAPTER 372.<a name=84> TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS</a></B><P>
<b>SUBCHAPTER F. BENEFITS</b><P>
<B>DIVISION 1.<a name=85> BENEFITS IN GENERAL</a></B><P>
<a name=86><B>1 TAC &#167;372.1513</B></a>
<P>
The Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and
Human Services Commission (HHSC) adopts an amendment to &#167;372.1513,
concerning Availability of Monthly Benefits. The amendment is adopted
without changes to the proposed text as published in the May 8, 2020,
issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg
2957). The rule will not be republished.
<P>
BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION
<P>
The amendment is necessary to comply with House Bill 1218, 86th
Legislature, Regular Session, 2019, which requires HHSC to distribute
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits across a
28-day period for new SNAP households certified on or after September
1, 2020.
<P>
The amendment to &#167;372.1513 changes the benefits distribution
schedule for SNAP and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
SNAP benefits will be available during the first 28 days of the month,
rather than the first 15 days. The amendment also clarifies that TANF
benefits are available during the first 3 days of the month and removes
the correlated SNAP and TANF distribution schedules.
<P>
COMMENTS
<P>
The 31-day comment period ended June 8, 2020. 
<P>
During this period, HHSC did not receive any comments regarding
the proposed rule. 
<p>
STATUTORY AUTHORITY
<P>
The amendment is adopted under Texas Government Code &#167;531.0055,
which provides that the Executive Commissioner of HHSC shall adopt
rules for the operation and provision of services by the health and
human services agencies and Human Resources Code &#167;33.002(c-1),
which requires the Executive Commissioner to adopt rules related to
distribution of SNAP benefits.
<P>
The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the
adoption and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.
<p>
Filed with the Office of the Secretary of State on July 22, 2020.
