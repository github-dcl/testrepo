<B>PART 1.<a name=91> TEXAS HIGHER EDUCATION COORDINATING BOARD</a></B><P>
<B>CHAPTER 1.<a name=92> AGENCY ADMINISTRATION</a></B><P>
<b>SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS</b><P>
<a name=93><B>19 TAC &#167;1.18</B></a>
<P>
The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board adopts
amendments to Chapter 1, Subchapter A, &#167;1.18, concerning the
Operation of Education Research Centers, without changes to the proposed
text as published in the June 19, 2020, issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 4133). The rule
will not be republished.
<P>
Specifically, this amendment will allow for improved access to
data for education researchers while maintaining controls for data
security. By law, up to three Education Research Centers (ERCs) are
authorized to operate in Texas. The ERCs are under the oversight of
the THECB and are governed by an Advisory Board which meets at least
quarterly and includes representation from the Texas Education Agency
and the Texas Workforce Commission and each ERC, among others. Researcher
proposals are reviewed and acted upon by the Advisory Board, and research
must be of benefit to the state of Texas. The ERCs are self-funded.
<P>
Currently, researchers must access the P-16/Workforce Data Repository
available through the ERCs by physically accessing special terminals
at the ERC locations. The rule amendments would allow a researcher
or researchers, when approved by the Advisory Board, to access the
de-identified data approved for their project via remote access. Security
guidelines for this access, including required Virtual Private Network
(VPN) and multifactor authentication have been developed and approved
by the ERC Advisory Board. All FERPA and other federal and state education
privacy law requirements must be met, as stipulated by existing ERC
law and rule.
<P>
There would be minimal costs to public institutions of higher education
to adjust to the revised rules given the security measures that the
authorized ERCs already have in place and the self-supporting nature
of the Education Research Centers.
<P>
The following comments were received within the public comment period.
<P>
COMMENTS: Researchers commented in favor of the amendments to allow
remote access to data at the Education Research Centers for researchers
so approved. Researchers who submitted comments are affiliated with
organizations and higher education institutions including the: Houston
Education Research Consortium at Rice University, Yale University's
Economics Department, the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford
School of Public Policy, Michigan State University, and the University
of California-Davis. Another researcher who submitted written testimony
has prior affiliations with the Texas Education Agency and Texas State
University. The comments and written testimony, all in favor of the
rule change, centered on a few common themes.
<P>
Researchers anticipate the proposed rule changes will lead to increased
use of the ERC data to address key policy questions across educational
and workforce sectors since researchers will now have the potential
to access the data remotely. Further, remote access can occur while
maintaining the rigorous data security standards that already are
in place under ERC onsite data access policies, without researchers
having to travel or schedule time to use limited physical facilities
onsite at the ERCs. In addition, risks and challenges due to the potential
spread of COVID-19, while not expected to be long-term, can be mitigated
for both researchers and ERC staff under approved remote access policies.
Otherwise, many researchers' projects may remain on hold or even if
restarted, may have to be halted again due to travel, shelter-in-place,
safety, or other restrictions.
<P>
The proposed changes allow for enhanced ERC capacity and self-sufficiency
without compromising researcher access to data or creating the need
for ERCs to acquire more physical space, which were limitations even
before the current pandemic restrictions began. Among the researchers
who commented, there is agreement that the value of the ERC data holdings
will increase, along with greater production of high-quality research
focused on improving educational policy and practice and enhancing,
thereby, the state's academic and workforce competitiveness. They
also observed that some research studies have been funded from federal
and foundation sources that also support ERC operations and staff,
along with faculty and graduate students at universities hosting the
ERCs. Thus, these changes in rule can foster the sustained presence
of the ERCs in the long run, in addition to other statewide benefits.
<P>
Finally, in the written testimony that was submitted, it was noted
that when the ERCs were created 13 years ago, VPN technology did not
meet the desired standards for functionality and security that were
deemed necessary to protect the confidentiality of the ERC data, which
was of paramount concern. Thus, providing researchers physical access
to the data onsite at an ERC under established policies and controls
mitigated concerns about compromised data confidentiality that would
have arisen in the early years with less secure, offsite VPN access.
Under current VPN technology, functionality and security features
are vastly improved, and the rule changes continue to reinforce the
necessity for ERCs to train researchers on policies and procedures
for ensuring that the confidentiality of the ERC data remains paramount
in researcher use of the data, even when data are accessed remotely.
In addition, while approved researchers will still pay fees to access
ERC data, due to the self-sustaining nature of the ERCs, they no longer
need to incur additional costs due to travel and time away from their
organizations or academic institutions.
<P>
STAFF RESPONSE: Staff agree with the comments.
<p>
The amendment is adopted under the Texas Education Code,
Title 1, Chapter 1, Sections 1.005 and 1.006. Section 1.005(b) authorizes
the Coordinating Board to establish up to three Education Research
Centers. Section 1.006 requires the establishment of an Advisory Board
for the purpose of reviewing study or evaluation proposals and ensuring
appropriate data use.
<P>
The amendments affect Texas Education Code, Sections 1.005 and 1.006.
<p>
The agency certifies that legal counsel has reviewed the
adoption and found it to be a valid exercise of the agency's legal authority.

<B>PART 2.<a name=94> TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY</a></B><P>
<B>CHAPTER 62.<a name=95> COMMISSIONER'S RULES CONCERNING THE EQUALIZED WEALTH LEVEL</a></B>
<P>
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) adopts the repeal of &#167;62.1071
and an amendment to &#167;62.1072, concerning the equalized wealth
level. The repeal and amendment are adopted without changes to the
proposed text as published in the April 24, 2020 issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 2631) and will
not be republished. 
<P>
The adopted repeal of &#167;62.1071 removes outdated provisions.
The adopted amendment to &#167;62.1072 implements House Bill (HB)
3, 86th Texas Legislature, 2019, by adopting as part of the Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) new manuals that describe the processes
and procedures that TEA will use in the administration of the provisions
of Texas Education Code (TEC), Chapter 49, and the fiscal, procedural,
and administrative requirements that must be met by school districts
subject to TEC, Chapter 49. 
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION: TEA has adopted the procedures contained
in each yearly manual for districts subject to wealth equalization
as part of the TAC since 2011. Manuals adopted for previous school
years remain in effect with respect to those school years. Each school
year's manual for districts subject to wealth equalization explains
how districts subject to wealth equalization are identified; the fiscal,
procedural, and administrative requirements those districts must meet;
and the consequences for not meeting requirements. The manual also
provides information on using the online Foundation School Program
(FSP) System to fulfill certain requirements. 
<P>
HB 3, 86th Texas Legislature, 2019, transferred, redesignated,
and amended TEC, &#167;41.006 as &#167;49.006, authorizing the commissioner
to adopt rules necessary for implementation of TEC, Chapter 49. Provisions
from TEC, Chapter 41, Equalized Wealth Level, were transferred to
TEC, Chapter 49, Options for Local Revenue Levels in Excess of Entitlement.
<P>
To align with changes made by HB 3, the title for 19 TAC Chapter
62 was changed from "Commissioner's Rules Concerning the Equalized
Wealth Level" to "Commissioner's Rules Concerning Options for Local
Revenue Levels in Excess of Entitlement."
<P>
The adopted repeal of &#167;62.1071, Manual for Districts Subject
to Wealth Equalization, removes outdated provisions from the 2016-2017
school year. The rule is obsolete. 
<P>
The adopted amendment to &#167;62.1072, Manual for Districts Subject
to Wealth Equalization, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 School Years, adopts
in rule the official TEA publications <I>Options
and Procedures for Local Revenue in Excess of Entitlement 2019-2020
School Year</I> as Figure: 19 TAC &#167;62.1072(a) and <I>Options and Procedures for Local Revenue in Excess
of Entitlement 2020-2021 School Year</I> as Figure: 19 TAC &#167;62.1072(b).
Additionally, the section title was changed from "Manual for Districts
Subject to Wealth Equalization, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 School Years"
to "Options and Procedures for Local Revenue in Excess of Entitlement,
2019-2020 and 2020-2021 School Years."
<P>
Significant changes addressed in the new publications are as follows.
<P>
<I>Chapter 41 Provisions</I>
<P>
TEC, Chapter 41, was renumbered to TEC, Chapter 49, and amended
by HB 3, 86th Texas Legislature, 2019. 
<P>
<I>Early Agreement Credit Provision</I>
<P>
Districts purchasing attendance credits from the state in accordance
with former TEC, Chapter 41, Subchapter D (Option 3), were able to
obtain a discount in the form of an early agreement credit in accordance
with former TEC, &#167;41.098. The discount was limited to 4.0% of
the computed cost of Option 3 before any discounts were applied or
$80 multiplied by the number of weighted average daily attendance
(WADA) purchased, whichever was less. To qualify, the district subject
to the provisions of TEC, Chapter 41, was to submit a signed Option
3 agreement to TEA with a postmark on or before September 1 of the
applicable year. TEC, &#167;41.098, was repealed by HB 3, and no equivalent
provision was enacted in TEC, Chapter 49. Therefore, this provision
will not continue. 
<P>
<I>Current Year Values</I>
<P>
As established in TEC, &#167;48.269, this determination is based
on estimates of enrollment for school year 2019-2020 and estimated
property values for tax year 2019. Because TEA does not yet have final
state certified property values for tax year 2019, it is using 2018
state certified property values increased by 5.76%, in accordance
with the 2020-2021 General Appropriations Act, as a proxy for tax
year 2019.
<P>
<I>Netting Provision</I>
<P>
TEC, &#167;41.0041, which provided certain districts the option
of authorizing the commissioner to withhold state aid in lieu of holding
an election, was repealed. However, provisions in TEC, &#167;48.257(c),
allow districts to offset the reduction of excess local revenue against
TEC, Chapter 48, Subchapter F, funds. All districts will have the
option to use state aid calculated under TEC, Chapter 48, Subchapter
F, as an offset to their attendance credit for purposes of reducing
their local revenue level. Districts using this option are required
to submit the district intent/choice selection form and complete an
Option 3 netting contract. 
<P>
<I>92-93 Hold Harmless Provision </I> 
<P>
The <I>Chapter 41 hold harmless provision</I> allowed
a district to retain more wealth than it would otherwise keep at the
equalized wealth level (EWL). A district was eligible for this provision
if the revenue per WADA generated by applying a $1.17 rate to the
tax base at the EWL was less than what the district's revenue per
WADA was in 1992-1993. This provision, which allowed a district to
keep a higher tax base, referred to as the hold harmless tax base,
so that its 1992-1993 revenue per WADA was maintained, was repealed
by HB 3. 
<P>
HB 3 created the Equalized Wealth Transition Grant, which will
be phased out over the next five years. A school district is entitled
to receive an annual allotment in an amount equal to the amount of
additional revenue a school district received for the 2018-2019 school
year under former TEC, &#167;41.002. Beginning in school year 2020-2021,
estimates of local property values for the current year will be collected
from districts for use in determinations for districts with local
revenue levels in excess of entitlement.
<P>
For purposes of calculating a district's allotment under the Equalized
Wealth Transition Grant, the amount to which a district is entitled
will be reduced by 20% for the 2020-2021 school year; 40% for the
2021-2022 school year; 60% for the 2022-2023 school year; and 80%
for the 2023-2024 school year.
<P>
The adopted amendment addresses new and revised provisions as applicable
in the publication for each school year, Figure: 19 TAC &#167;62.1072(a)
for the 2019-2020 school year and Figure: 19 TAC &#167;62.1072(b)
for the 2020-2021 school year.

<B>CHAPTER 101.<a name=98> ASSESSMENT</a></B><P>
<b>SUBCHAPTER CC. COMMISSIONER'S RULES CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACADEMIC CONTENT AREAS TESTING PROGRAM</b><P>
<B>DIVISION 1.<a name=99> IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS</a></B><P>
<a name=100><B>19 TAC &#167;101.3011</B></a>
<P>
The Texas Education Agency adopts an amendment to
&#167;101.3011, concerning the implementation and administration of
academic content area assessment instruments. The amendment is adopted
without changes to the proposed text as published in the May 8, 2020
issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg
3009) and will not be republished. The adopted amendment modifies
the rule to clarify testing requirements for accelerated students
who have completed end-of-course (EOC) assessments before entering
high school. 
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION: Section 101.3011 addresses state and federal
requirements relating to the implementation and administration of
academic content area assessment instruments. The adopted amendment
to 19 TAC &#167;101.3011 clarifies state and federal testing requirements
relating to accelerated students. 
<P>
In alignment with federal testing and accountability requirements,
all students are required to be tested at least once in high school.
To satisfy federal requirements, students who complete their state
required EOC assessments before entering high school are now required
to take the ACT&reg; or SAT&reg;. In accordance with House Bill 3,
86th Texas Legislature, 2019, Texas Education Code (TEC), &#167;39.0261(a)(3)(A),
College Preparation Assessment, now provides for students to take
a nationally norm-referenced assessment used by colleges and universities
one time during high school at state cost. The scores of these tests
will be used for federal accountability purposes if a student has
completed EOC assessments prior to entering high school. 
<P>
The adopted amendment adds new subsection (a)(2) to require students
in Grades 3-8 who are accelerated and are on track to complete EOC
assessment requirements prior to entering high school to take either
the ACT&reg; or SAT&reg; at least once in high school for federal
accountability purposes. District may choose to have these students
test between January of Grade 11 through graduation at state cost
in accordance with TEC, &#167;39.0261(a)(3)(A). 
<P>
The adopted amendment deletes language that references the previous
statewide assessment program, the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and
Skills (TAKS). With the implementation of Senate Bill (SB) 463 and
SB 1005, 85th Texas Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, TAKS is no
longer administered. As such, this language is no longer applicable.
<P>
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS AND AGENCY RESPONSES: The public comment period
on the proposal began May 8, 2020, and ended June 22, 2020. Following
is a summary of public comments received and corresponding agency responses. 
<P>
Comment: The Texas School Alliance (TSA) and the College Board
both agreed with the proposed amendment, indicating that it will benefit students.
<P>
Response: The agency agrees.
<P>
Comment: TSA requested that clarification be added regarding testing
requirements for students who are accelerated by more than one grade level.
<P>
Response: The agency disagrees that clarification is needed regarding
students who are accelerated by more than one grade level. TEC, &#167;39.023(a),
and &#167;101.3011(a)(1) require all students to be tested on grade
level unless the student is accelerated and taking a corresponding
test. In most cases, students who are accelerated by more than one
grade level do not have a corresponding test to take. Therefore, these
students must take their enrolled grade level assessment. This testing
policy has been included in testing manuals and has not changed. 
<P>
Comment: TSA requested modifying the amendment to indicate how
and when ACT&reg; and SAT&reg; scores would be used for accountability. 
<P>
Response: This comment is outside the scope of the proposed rulemaking
since accountability reporting requirements are not addressed in &#167;101.3011.
<P>
Comment: TSA requested that Advanced Placement (AP) and International
Baccalaureate (IB) exams be included to provide accelerated students
more testing options in high school. 
<P>
Response: The agency disagrees. Although including AP and IB exams
would provide accelerated students more testing options, ACT&reg;
and SAT&reg; were identified for this purpose to alleviate the financial
burden of testing from students and districts. TEC, &#167;39.0261(a)(3)(A),
provides for high school students to take once at state cost a nationally
norm-referenced assessment used by colleges as part of their undergraduate
admissions process. 
<P>
Comment: An educator expressed concern about the increased burden
to school districts to track these students. 
<P>
Response: The agency provides the following clarification. Annually,
the agency plans to provide districts with a list of accelerated students
who have completed EOC assessments by the end of Grade 8 and who do
not have a corresponding ACT&reg; or SAT&reg; score on file.
<P>
Comment: An educator expressed concern about the cost to the state. 
<P>
Response: The agency provides the following clarification. Funding
for reimbursement under &#167;101.3001 was allocated by HB 3, 86th
Texas Legislature, 2019, through TEC, &#167;48.155, College Preparation
Assessment Reimbursement.
<P>
STATUTORY AUTHORITY. The amendment is adopted under Texas
Education Code (TEC), &#167;28.0211(o) and (p), which provide that
accelerated students in Grades 5 and 8 are not required to take their
grade-level assessment and may not be denied promotion based on their
performance on an advanced assessment; TEC, &#167;39.023(a), (a-2),
(b), (c), and (l), which specify the required testing for students
in Grades 3-8, accelerated students, students who are significantly
cognitively disabled, students enrolled in high school courses, and
students whose primary language is Spanish, respectively; TEC, &#167;39.0238,
which establishes Algebra II and English III EOC assessments as measures
of postsecondary readiness; TEC, &#167;39.0261(a)(3)(A), which provides
for high school students to take a nationally norm-referenced assessment
one time at state cost; and the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act, &#167;1111(b)(2)(C),
which allows states to exempt Grade 8 students from their grade-level
mathematics assessment and instead take and use a score from the state's
EOC mathematics assessment for accountability purposes as long as
a more advanced assessment is taken to fulfill accountability requirements
in high school.
<P>
CROSS REFERENCE TO STATUTE. The amendment implements Texas Education
Code, &#167;&#167;28.0211(o) and (p); 39.023(a), (a-2), (b), (c),
and (l); 39.0238; and 39.0261(a)(3)(A); and the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act,
&#167;1111(b)(2)(C).
