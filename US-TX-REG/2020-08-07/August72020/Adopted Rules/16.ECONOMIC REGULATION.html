<P>
The Texas Racing Commission ("the Commission") adopts
amendments to 16 TAC &#167;&#167;303.321, Allocations to Breed Registries;
303.322, Limitations on Use of Funds by Breed Registries; and 303.325,
Quarterly Reports. The amendments clarify certain provisions of the
rules that were adopted in October 2019 regarding the horse industry
escrow account ("account") created by House Bill 2463 (86th Legislature,
Regular Session, 2019).
<P>
The amendments to Sections 303.321 and 303.325 are adopted without
changes from the text as proposed in the June 5, 2020, issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 3725) and will
not be republished. Amendments to Section 303.321 require events funded
from the account to serve certain types of public purposes, require
breed registries to use forms approved by the executive director when
applying for funding from the account, and delete a provision regarding
executive director approval of requests prior to January 1, 2020.
Amendments to Section 303.325 clarify the quarterly reporting requirements.
<P>
The amendments to Section 303.322 are being adopted with changes
from the text as proposed in the June 5, 2020, issue of the <I>Texas Register</I> (45 TexReg 3725). The proposed
amendments to this section clarify the 5% limitation on administrative
costs paid from the fund and the requirement to comply with the Texas
Uniform Grant Management Standards and require unused funds from canceled
events to be repaid within 45 days. In response to public comments,
the provisions regarding unused funds from canceled events were moved
to a new subsection (f) and subsection (g) was added to address unused
funds from events that took place. These changes are not so substantial
as to constitute a different rule or to involve parties not already
on notice of the changes.
<P>
REASONED JUSTIFICATION
<P>
The reasoned justification for these amendments is clarity regarding
requirements for applying for, using, and reporting on funding from
the account.
<P>
PUBLIC COMMENTS
<P>
Comments regarding Section 303.322, were submitted jointly by the
Texas Quarter Horse Association, Texas Thoroughbred Association, Texas
Arabian Breeders Association, and Texas Paint Horse Association, requesting
that the rule address funds remaining after an event takes place.
New subsection (g) addresses that situation, allowing the Commission
to require the return of funds in that instance.
<P>
STATUTORY AUTHORITY
<P>
The amendments are adopted under Tex. Occ. Code &#167;2023.004,
which authorizes the Commission to adopt rules to administer the Act,
and &#167;2028.201, which requires the Commission to adopt rules relating
to Tex. Occ. Code Subchapter E, Chapter 2028.
<P>
No other statute, code, or article is affected by the amendments.
