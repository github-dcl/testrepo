                      <p>As a guide to the interpretation and application of this division the public policy of this State is declared as follows:</p>
                      <p>Experience has shown that large numbers of the population of California do not enjoy permanent employment by reason of which their purchasing power is unstable. This is detrimental to the interests of the people of California as a whole.</p>
                      <p>The benefit to all persons resulting from public and private enterprise is realized in the final consumption of goods and services. It is contrary to public policy to permit the supply of consumption goods and services at prices which do not provide against that harm to the population consequent upon periods of unemployment of those who contribute to the production and distribution of such goods and services.</p>
                      <p>Experience has shown that private charity and local relief cannot alone prevent the effects of unemployment. Experience has shown that if the State awaits the coming of excessive unemployment it can neither create immediately the organization necessary to orderly, economical and effective relief nor bear the financial burden of relief without disrupting its whole system of ordinary revenues and without jeopardizing its credit.</p>
                      <p>The Legislature therefore declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of the State require the enactment of this measure under the police power of the State, for the compulsory setting aside of funds to be used for a system of unemployment insurance providing benefits for persons unemployed through no fault of their own, and to reduce involuntary unemployment and the suffering caused thereby to a minimum.</p>
                      <p>It is the intent of the Legislature that unemployed persons claiming unemployment insurance benefits shall be required to make all reasonable effort to secure employment on their own behalf.</p>

                      <p>This part is a part of a national plan of unemployment reserves and social security, and is enacted for the purpose of assisting in the stabilization of employment conditions. The imposition of the tax herein imposed upon California industry alone, without a corresponding tax being imposed upon all industry in the United States, would, by the corresponding penalty upon California industry, defeat the very purposes of this law as set forth in this article. Therefore when existing federal legislation which provides for a tax upon the payment of wages by employers in this State, against which all or any part of the employer contributions required under this part may be credited is repealed, amended, interpreted, affected or otherwise changed in such manner that no portion of such contributions may be thus credited, then upon the date of such change, the provisions of this part requiring employer contributions and providing for payment of unemployment compensation benefits shall cease to be operative and any assets in the Unemployment Fund or Unemployment Administration Fund shall in the discretion of the State Treasurer be held in the then existing depositaries or otherwise in the State Treasury. In the case of the Unemployment Administration Fund, such money may thereafter be dealt with by the State Treasurer pursuant to the conditions of the grant thereof to the State by the United States Government or agency thereof.</p>

The director and the appeals board administrative law judges shall be controlled by those precedents except as modified by judicial review. If the appeals board issues decisions other than those designated as precedent decisions, anything incorporated in those decisions shall be physically attached to and be made a part of the decisions.

                        <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when motion picture production workers are employed by one or more affiliated entities of a motion picture payroll services company that has elected to be treated and is being treated as the employer of those motion picture production workers pursuant to Section 679, the motion picture payroll services company may apply to the director for approval of the extension of an existing voluntary plan or plans for the payment of disability benefits to all motion picture production workers employed by all of the affiliated entities of the motion picture payroll services company. The director shall approve the extension of the voluntary plan to all of the motion picture production workers of all of the affiliated entities if he or she finds all of the following exist:</p>
                        <p>(1) The voluntary plan to be extended was in existence at the time of the election of the motion picture payroll services company to be treated as the employer of motion picture production workers pursuant to Section 679.</p>
                        <p>(2) The rights afforded to the covered employees are greater than those provided for in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 2625) and Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 3300) of Part 2 of Division 1.</p>
                        <p>(3) The plan has been made available to all of the motion picture production workers of the employer employed in this state.</p>
                        <p>(4) If the plan provides for insurance, the form of the insurance policies to be issued has been approved by the Insurance Commissioner and the policies are to be issued by an admitted disability insurer.</p>
                        <p>(5) The motion picture payroll services company has consented to the extension of the plan and has agreed to make the payroll deductions required, if any, and transmit the proceeds to the plan insurer, if any.</p>
                        <p>(6) The plan provides for the inclusion of future employees in the manner described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).</p>
                        <p>(7) (A) The plan will be in effect for a period of not less than one year and, thereafter, continuously, unless the director finds that the motion picture payroll services company or a majority of motion picture production workers employed in this state covered by the plan has given notice of withdrawal from the plan. The notice shall be filed in writing with the director and shall be effective only on the anniversary of the effective date of the plan next following the filing of the notice, but in any event not less than 30 days from the date of the filing of the notice.</p>
                        <p>(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or on the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal from the plan is transmitted to the director not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of that law or change. If the plan is not withdrawn on 30 days’ notice because of the enactment of a law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or because of a change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, the plan shall be amended to conform to that increase or change on the operative date of the increase or change.</p>
                        <p>(8) The amount of deductions from the wages of an employee in effect for any plan shall not be increased on a date other than an anniversary date of the effective date of the plan, except to the extent that any increase in the deductions from the wages of an employee allowed by Section 3260 permits that amount to exceed the amount of deductions in effect. The amount of deductions, for the purpose of providing coverage under the plan, shall not exceed that which would be required by Sections 984 and 985 if the employee were not covered by the plan.</p>
                        <p>(9) The approval of the extension of the plan will not result in a substantial selection of risks adverse to the Disability Fund.</p>

                        <p>The extension of a plan approved by the director pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be deemed to have also met the consent requirements of Section 3257 if both of the following requirements are met:</p>
                        <p>(1) The plan met the consent requirements of Section 3257 when initially adopted.</p>
                        <p>(2) The plan provides for both of the following:</p>
                        <p>(A) Each employee to whom the plan is applicable shall be given written notice of his or her right to reject coverage under the plan and a written statement setting forth the essential features of the plan prior to or at the time of employment. The form of the notice and of the statement shall be approved by the director.</p>
                        <p>(B) On or before January 31 of each calendar year, each employee shall be given written notice, in a form approved by the director, of his or her right to withdraw from the plan at the beginning of any calendar quarter upon giving reasonable notice in writing directed to the motion picture payroll services company.</p>

                        <p>Any individual who is an employer under this division or any two or more individuals who have so qualified may file with the director a written election that their services shall be deemed to be services performed by individuals in employment for an employer for all the purposes of this division. Upon the approval of the election by the director, the services of those individuals shall be deemed to constitute employment for an employer for all of the purposes of this division. Regardless of their actual earnings, for the purposes of computing benefit rights and contributions under this division, they shall be deemed to have received the following remuneration for each calendar quarter:</p>
                        <p>(1) For purposes of unemployment insurance, the highest amount of wages required to be entitled to the maximum benefit amount provided in Section 1280.</p>
                        <p>(2) For purposes of disability insurance, the highest amount of wages required to be entitled to the maximum benefit amount provided in Section 2655.</p>
                        <p>(A) For disability insurance contributions on or after July 1, 1994, the quarterly contribution shall be the product of one-fourth of the amount of net profit, but not less than one thousand one hundred fifty dollars ($1,150) except when subparagraph (B) applies, reported on or before April 15 of the preceding year as declared on the Internal Revenue Service Schedule SE filed by an individual who is an employer under this division and the contribution rate established pursuant to Section 984.5, except as provided by Section 985. On January 1, 1995, quarterly income credits for the period from July 1, 1993, to June 30, 1994, inclusive, shall be changed to one-fourth of the amount of the net profit or four thousand six hundred dollars ($4,600), whichever is greater, reported on or before April 15, 1993, as declared on the Internal Revenue Service Schedule SE for the 1992 taxable year filed by each individual having an elective coverage agreement in effect for that period or any portion thereof. If no Internal Revenue Service Schedule SE was filed, the individual shall be assigned a quarterly income credit of one thousand one hundred fifty dollars ($1,150). Quarterly income credits for this period shall not exceed seven thousand nine hundred forty-two dollars ($7,942). If any quarterly income credit for the period from July 1, 1993, to June 30, 1994, inclusive, was reduced prior to January 1, 1995, the amended income credit shall be reduced proportionately. Benefits payable for periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 1995, shall be based on Section 2655. For purposes of this division, income credits shall be included in the term “wages.”</p>
                        <p>(B) The self-employed individual shall not pay contributions for periods of any disability, including periods for which some services are performed while disabled. The self-employed individual shall file a quarterly report of wages and certify as to the period of disability in order to maintain eligibility for elective disability insurance coverage and benefits. During periods of disability, the self-employed individual shall reduce his or her quarterly contributions by dividing the quarterly contribution amount by 91 to compute the daily contribution amount, and the daily contribution amount shall be multiplied by the number of days disabled to compute the amount by which the quarterly contributions shall be reduced. The department shall reduce income credits utilizing the same calculation method.</p>

The rate shall be determined by dividing the estimated benefits and administrative costs paid in the prior year by the product of the annual remuneration deemed to have been received under Sections 708 and 708.5 and the estimated number of persons who were covered at any time in the prior year. The resulting rate shall be rounded to the next higher one-hundredth percentage point. The rate may also be reduced or increased by a factor estimated to maintain as nearly as practicable a cumulative zero balance in the funds contributed pursuant to Sections 708 and 708.5. Estimates made pursuant to this subdivision may be made on the basis of statistical sampling, or another method determined by the director.</p>

                        <p>Effective January 1, 1994, the director shall prepare a statement on or before November 30 of each calendar year, which shall be a public record, declaring the rate of contributions of the succeeding calendar year for all employers and self-employed individuals covered under Section 708 or 708.5 and shall notify promptly the employers and self-employed individuals of the rate. For calendar years 1994 to 1996, inclusive, worker contributions required under Section 708 or 708.5 shall be at a rate determined by the director to reimburse the Disability Fund for the sum of estimated administrative costs due to those sections and unemployment compensation disability benefits estimated to be paid to all employers and self-employed individuals covered by those sections. The rate shall be determined by dividing the sum of the benefits expected to be paid in the following calendar year and the administrative costs expected to be incurred under Section 708 or 708.5 during that calendar year by earnings estimated to be reported under those sections for that same calendar year. The resulting rate shall be rounded to the next higher one-hundredth percentage point. This rate may also be reduced or increased by a factor estimated to maintain as nearly as practicable a cumulative zero balance in funds contributed pursuant to Section 708 or 708.5.</p>
                        <p>For calendar year 1997, and each calendar year thereafter, the rate established each November 30 shall be determined by multiplying the current year’s rate by the ratio of 1.10 times the current year disbursements divided by contributions for the same period, under Sections 708 and 708.5. If in any calendar year the cumulative balance of contributions minus disbursements equals or exceeds 20 percent of annual disbursements, the contribution rate for the succeeding year shall be adjusted to a level necessary to maintain revenues at no more than 20 percent over annual disbursements. If legislation is enacted necessitating adjustments in the benefit levels for employers and self-employed individuals covered under Section 708 or 708.5, the rate may be adjusted by a factor estimated to provide that funds contributed pursuant to Section 708 or 708.5 cover disbursements pursuant to these sections.</p>
                        <p>For the purpose of this subdivision, disbursements are defined as the sum of unemployment compensation disability benefits paid to employers and self-employed individuals covered under Section 708 or 708.5, plus administrative costs related to those sections. Estimates made pursuant to this subdivision shall be available for public inspection.</p>

Such records shall be open to inspection and shall be subject to being copied by the director or his authorized representative at any time during the business hours of the employing unit.

If so established by other evidence upon default of the employer, after notice, such lesser total amount of benefits thus determined shall be conclusive.

If the administrative law judge or the board, on appeal from an administrative law judge’s decision, decides that the assessment should not have been levied under Section 1137, the assessment shall automatically become, and shall have the effect of, an assessment pursuant to Section 1126 or 1127, whichever is applicable. If the administrative law judge or the board decides that the assessment was properly levied under Section 1137, this decision shall be incorporated in any decision rendered following the hearing pursuant to subdivision (d).

                        <p>(1) The director may approve a settlement of a civil employment tax matter in dispute involving a reduction of tax in settlement of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) or less. However, once an appeal of an employment tax matter dispute has been filed with the appeals board, the appeal has been assigned to an administrative law judge, and a notice of hearing has been issued, approval of the settlement by the assigned administrative law judge shall be obtained. If the decision of the administrative law judge has been appealed, approval of the appeals board shall be obtained. A proposed settlement shall be grounds for continuance of the scheduled hearing until the Attorney General has completed a review of the proposed settlement. “Civil employment tax matters in dispute” means those matters that are the subject of protests, appeals, or refund claims.</p>
                        <p>(2) Except as provided by paragraph (3), each proposed settlement shall be submitted to the Attorney General. Within 30 days of receiving that proposed settlement, the Attorney General shall review the recommendation and advise, in writing, of his or her conclusions as to whether the recommendation is reasonable from an overall perspective. If the Attorney General determines that the settlement is reasonable from an overall perspective, the director, and the administrative law judge or the appeals board, as applicable, may then determine if a settlement will be approved.</p>
                        <p>(3) A settlement of any civil employment tax matter dispute involving a reduction of tax or penalties in settlement, the total of which reduction of tax and penalties in settlement does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000), may be approved by the director, and the administrative law judge or the appeals board, as applicable, without prior submission to the Attorney General.</p>

                        <p>No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any amount of contributions, interest or penalties alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected unless a claim for refund or credit has been filed pursuant to this chapter. Within 90 days after the service of the notice of the decision of the appeals board upon an appeal, the claimant may bring an action against the director on the grounds set forth in the claim in a court of competent jurisdiction in the County of Sacramento for the recovery of the whole or any part of the amount with respect to which the claim has been denied. The director may, in writing, extend for a period of not exceeding two years the time within which such action may be instituted if written request for such extension is filed with the director within the 90-day period. Failure to bring action within the time specified constitutes a waiver of any demand against the state on account of alleged overpayments. If the appeals board fails to serve notice of its decision on the appeal within 90 days after an appeal is filed, the claimant may consider the claim denied and may bring an action against the director under this section.</p>

                        <p>(1) Commence or continue to pursue any administrative or judicial action to collect benefits where there has been a final determination that these benefits have been overpaid or chargeable to the alien, because of the alien’s immigration status at the time he or she performed the services compensated by his or her base period wages.</p>
                        <p>(2) Determine that the alien was overpaid benefits in the current benefit year or in any prior benefit year, if the basis for the determination is the assumption that because the alien is an applicant for temporary resident status he or she was not, while performing the services compensated by base period wages, lawfully admitted for permanent residence, lawfully present for purposes of performing the services that were compensated by his or her base period wages, or permanently residing in the United States under color of law.</p>

                      <p>Experience has shown that the ability of a large number of the population of California to compete for jobs in the labor market is impaired by advancement in technological improvements, the widespread effects of automation and relocation in our economy, and foreign competition as set forth in petitions certified under the federal Trade Act of 1974, as amended (Title 19, United States Code, Sections 2101 et seq.). The Legislature finds that many individuals in California are lacking in skills that would make them competitive in the labor market. They are in need of training or retraining to upgrade their skills required in demand occupations. It is the policy of this state to assist these individuals by providing unemployment compensation benefits, extended duration benefits, and other federally funded unemployment compensation benefits, including those available under the federal Trade Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-618), as amended by the federal Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-210), during a period of retraining to qualify them for jobs in demand occupations and thus avoid long-term unemployment.</p>

                      <p>“Benefit year”, with respect to any individual, means the 52-week period beginning with the first day of the week with respect to which the individual first files a valid claim for benefits and thereafter the 52-week period beginning with the week in which such individual again files a valid claim after the termination of his or her last preceding benefit year. As used in this section, “valid claim” means any claim for benefits made in accordance with this division and authorized regulations if the individual filing the claim is unemployed and has met the requirements of subdivision (a) of Section 1281. For the purpose of determining whether a claim is a “valid claim” within the meaning of this section, an individual otherwise unemployed shall be deemed unemployed even though wages, as defined in Section 1252, which are for a period subsequent to the termination of performance of services are payable with respect to the week for which he or she files the claim.</p>

The application for approval of a plan shall require the employer to briefly describe the circumstances requiring the use of work sharing to avoid a layoff. Normal weekly hours of work means the number of hours in a week that the employee normally would work for the regular employer or 40 hours, whichever is less. The plan must involve the participation of at least two employees and include not less than 10 percent of the employer’s regular permanent work force involved in the affected work unit or units in each week, or in at least one week of a two-consecutive-week period. A plan approved by the director shall expire six months after the effective date of the plan.</p>

                        <p>This section shall apply to work sharing plans that become effective before July 1, 2014. No work sharing plan that becomes effective before July 1, 2014, shall be renewed on or after July 1, 2014. Any work sharing plan that is entered into on or after July 1, 2014, shall be subject to Section 1279.5 as added by Assembly Bill 1392 of the 2013-14 Regular Session.</p>
                        <p><i>(Amended by Stats. 2013, Ch. 141, Sec. 1. (AB 1392) Effective January 1, 2014. Applicable, by its own provisions, to work sharing plans in effect before July 1, 2014. See later operative version added by Sec. 2 of Ch. 141.)</i></p>
                        <p>1279.5.</p>
                        <p>(a) As used in this section:</p>
                        <p>(1) “Affected unit” means a specified plant, department, shift, or other definable unit that includes two or more workers and not less than 10 percent of the employer’s regular permanent work force involved in the affected unit or units in each week, or in at least one week of a two-consecutive-week period, to which an approved work sharing plan applies.</p>
                        <p>(2) “Health and retirement benefits” means employer-provided health benefits and retirement benefits under a defined benefit pension plan, as defined in Section 414(j) of the Internal Revenue Code, or contributions under a defined contribution plan, as defined in Section 414(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, that are incidents of employment in addition to the cash remuneration earned.</p>
                        <p>(3) “Work sharing compensation” means the unemployment compensation benefits payable to employees in an affected unit under an approved work sharing plan, as distinguished from the unemployment compensation benefits otherwise payable under this part.</p>
                        <p>(4) “Work sharing plan” means a plan submitted by an employer, for approval by the director, under which the employer requests the payment of work sharing compensation to employees in an affected unit of the employer in lieu of layoffs.</p>
                        <p>(5) “Work sharing program” means the program described by this section.</p>
                        <p>(6) “Usual weekly hours of work” means the usual hours of work for full- or part-time employees in the affected unit when that unit is operating on its regular basis, not to exceed 40 hours and not including hours of overtime work.</p>
                        <p>(7) “Unemployment compensation” means the unemployment compensation benefits payable under this part other than work sharing compensation and includes amounts payable pursuant to an agreement under federal law providing for compensation, assistance, or allowances with respect to unemployment.</p>
                        <p>(b) Notwithstanding Section 1252 or 1252.2 or any other provision of this part, for the purposes of this section an employee is “unemployed” in any week if the employee works less than their usual weekly hours of work for the employee’s regular employer, as the result of the regular employer’s participation in a work sharing plan that meets the requirements of this section and has been approved by the director, pursuant to which the employer, in lieu of layoff, reduces employment and stabilizes the workforce.</p>
                        <p>(c) Except as provided in Section 1279.7 an employer wishing to participate in the work sharing program, on and after July 1, 2014, shall submit a signed written work sharing plan to the director for approval. The director shall develop an application form to request approval of a work sharing plan and an approval process that meets the requirements of this section. The application shall include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) The affected unit covered by the plan, including the number of full- or part-time employees in the unit, the percentage of employees in the affected unit covered by the plan, identification of each individual employee in the affected unit by name, social security number, and the employer’s unemployment tax account number and any other information required by the director to identify plan participants.</p>
                        <p>(2) A description of how employees in the affected unit will be notified of the employer’s participation in the work sharing plan if the application is approved, including how the employer will notify those employees in a collective bargaining unit as well as any employees in the affected unit who are not in a collective bargaining unit. If the employer does not intend to provide advance notice to employees in the affected unit, the employer shall explain in a statement in the application why it is not feasible to provide that notice.</p>
                        <p>(3) A requirement that the employer identify, in the application, the usual weekly hours of work for employees in the affected unit and the specific percentage by which their hours will be reduced during all weeks covered by the plan. The percentage of reduction of usual weekly hours of work for which a work sharing plan may be approved shall not be less than 10 percent or more than 60 percent. If the plan includes any week for which the employer regularly does not provide work, including, but not limited to, incidences due to a holiday or plant closing, then that week shall be identified in the application.</p>
                        <p>(4) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), certification by the employer, if the employer provides health and retirement benefits to any employee whose usual weekly hours of work are to be reduced under the plan, that the benefits will continue to be provided, to the extent permitted by federal law, to employees participating in the work sharing plan under the same terms and conditions as though the usual weekly hours of work of these employees had not been reduced or to the same extent as other employees not participating in the work sharing plan. For defined benefit retirement plans, to the extent permitted by federal law, the hours that are reduced under the work sharing plan shall be credited for purposes of participation, vesting, and accrual of benefits as though the usual weekly hours of work had not been reduced. The dollar amount of employer contributions to a defined contribution plan that are based on a percentage of compensation may be less due to the reduction in the employee’s compensation.</p>
                        <p>(B) If a reduction in health and retirement benefits is scheduled to occur during the duration of the plan and those reductions will be applied equally to employees who are not participating in the work sharing program, then the application shall so certify, and those benefits may be reduced for those employees who are participating in the work sharing plan.</p>
                        <p>(5) Certification by the employer that the aggregate reduction in work hours is in lieu of temporary or permanent layoffs, or both. The application shall include an estimate of the number of workers who would have been laid off in the absence of the work sharing plan.</p>
                        <p>(6) Agreement by the employer to do all of the following:</p>
                        <p>(A) Furnish reports to the director relating to the proper conduct of the plan.</p>
                        <p>(B) Allow the director or the director’s authorized representatives access to all records necessary to approve or disapprove the plan application.</p>
                        <p>(C) After approval of a plan, monitor and evaluate the plan.</p>
                        <p>(D) Follow any other directives the director deems necessary for the department to implement the plan and that are consistent with the requirements for plan applications.</p>
                        <p>(7) Certification by the employer that participation in the work sharing plan and its implementation is consistent with the employer’s obligations under applicable federal and state laws.</p>
                        <p>(8) The effective date and duration of the plan, which shall not be later than the end of the 12th full calendar month after the effective date.</p>
                        <p>(9) Any other provision added to the application by the director that the United States Secretary of Labor determines to be appropriate for purposes of a work sharing plan.</p>
                        <p>(d) The director shall approve or disapprove a work sharing plan in writing by the close of business no later than 10 working days from the date the completed plan is received and communicate the decision to the employer. A decision disapproving the plan shall clearly identify the reasons for the disapproval. Within 20 days, the employer may submit a request for review of the disapproved work sharing plan to the director’s work sharing administrator, whom the director shall designate for this purpose. After review, the work sharing administrator’s decision of approval or disapproval shall be final. If disapproved, the employer may submit a different work sharing plan for approval.</p>
                        <p>(e) The director shall work with the employer to determine the effective date of a work sharing plan, which shall be specified in the notice of approval to the employer. The plan shall expire on the date specified in the notice of approval, which shall be either the date at the end of the 12th full calendar month after its effective date or an earlier date mutually agreed upon by the employer and the director. However, if a work sharing plan is revoked by the director under subdivision (f) of this section, the plan shall terminate on the date specified in the director’s written order of revocation. An employer may terminate a work sharing plan at any time upon written notice to the director. An employer may submit an application to renew the work sharing plan not more than 10 days after a previously approved work sharing plan expires.</p>
                        <p>(f) The director may revoke approval of a work sharing plan for good cause at any time. The revocation order shall be in writing and shall specify the reasons for the revocation and the date the revocation is effective. The director may periodically review the operation of an employer’s work sharing plan to ensure that good cause does not exist for revocation of the approval of the plan. For purposes of these provisions, good cause includes, but is not limited to, failure to comply with the assurances given in the plan, unreasonable revision of productivity standards for the affected unit, conduct or occurrences tending to defeat the intent and effective operation of the work sharing plan, and violation of any criteria on which approval of the plan was based.</p>
                        <p>(g) An employer may request a modification of an approved plan by filing a written request to the director. The request shall identify the specific provisions proposed to be modified and provide an explanation of why the proposed modification is appropriate for the work sharing plan. The director shall approve or disapprove the proposed modification in writing by the close of business no later than 10 working days from the date the proposed modification is received and communicate the decision to the employer. The director, in the director’s discretion, may approve a request for modification of the plan based on conditions that have changed since the plan was approved, provided that the modification is consistent with and supports the purposes for which the plan was initially approved. A modification does not extend the expiration date of the original plan, and the director shall promptly notify the employer whether the plan modification has been approved and, if approved, the effective date of the modification, which shall not be earlier than the effective date of the original work sharing plan. An employer is not required to request approval of a plan modification from the director if the change is not substantial, but the employer shall promptly report, in writing, every change to the plan to the director. The director may terminate an employer’s plan if the employer fails to meet this reporting requirement. If the director determines that the reported change is substantial, the director shall require the employer to request a modification to the plan.</p>
                        <p>(h) (1) An employee is eligible to receive work sharing compensation with respect to any week only if the employee is monetarily eligible for unemployment compensation, not otherwise disqualified for unemployment compensation, and both of the following are true:</p>
                        <p>(A) During the week, the employee is employed as a member of an affected unit under an approved work sharing plan, which was approved prior to that week, and the plan is in effect with respect to the week for which work sharing compensation is claimed.</p>
                        <p>(B) Notwithstanding any other provisions relating to availability for work and actively seeking work, the employee is available for the employee’s usual hours of work with the work sharing employer, which may include, for purposes of this section, participating in training to enhance job skills that is approved by the director, such as employer-sponsored training or training funded under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 3101 et seq.).</p>
                        <p>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an employee covered by a work sharing plan is deemed unemployed in any week during the duration of that plan if the employee’s remuneration as an employee in an affected unit is reduced based on a reduction of the employee’s usual weekly hours of work under an approved work sharing plan.</p>
                        <p>(i) For the purposes of this section, an employee shall not be disqualified under subdivision (c) of Section 1253 for any week if both of the following conditions exist:</p>
                        <p>(1) The employee has not been absent from work without the approval of the regular employer.</p>
                        <p>(2) The employee accepted all work the regular employer made available to the individual during hours scheduled off due to the work sharing plan.</p>
                        <p>(j) The work sharing weekly compensation amount shall be the product of the regular weekly unemployment compensation amount for a week of total unemployment multiplied by the percentage of reduction in the individual’s usual weekly hours of work.</p>
                        <p>(k) (1) Provisions applicable to unemployment compensation shall apply to employees in a work sharing plan to the extent that they are not inconsistent with work sharing program provisions. An employee who files an initial claim for work sharing compensation shall receive a monetary determination. An employee may be eligible for work sharing compensation or unemployment compensation, as appropriate, except that an employee shall not be eligible for combined benefits in any benefit year in an amount more than the maximum entitlement established for regular unemployment compensation, nor shall an employee be paid work sharing benefits for more than 52 weeks under a work sharing plan.</p>
                        <p>(2) An employee who is not provided any work during a week by the work sharing employer, or any other employer, and who is otherwise eligible for unemployment compensation, shall be eligible for the amount of regular unemployment compensation to which the employee would otherwise be eligible.</p>
                        <p>(3) An employee who is not provided any work by the work sharing employer during a week, but who works for another employer and is otherwise eligible, may be paid unemployment compensation for that week subject to the disqualifying income and other provisions applicable to claims for regular unemployment compensation.</p>
                        <p>(4) The work sharing compensation paid to an employee shall be deducted from the maximum entitlement amount of regular unemployment compensation established for that employee’s benefit year.</p>
                        <p>(5) An employee who has received all of the work sharing compensation or combined unemployment compensation and work sharing compensation available in a benefit year shall be considered an exhaustee for purposes of extended benefits and, if otherwise eligible under those provisions, shall be eligible to receive extended benefits.</p>
                        <p>(6) No employee who receives any benefits under this section during any benefit year shall receive any benefits pursuant to Section 1252 or 1252.2 as a partially unemployed individual with respect to any week during a benefit year while in employment status with the regular employer who initiated the work sharing plan under this section.</p>
                        <p>(7) Sections 1253.5 and 1279 shall not apply to any individual eligible for any payment under this section.</p>
                        <p>(l) Any amount payable under this section shall be reduced by the amount of any and all compensation payable for personal services, whether performed as an employee or an independent contractor or as a juror or as a witness, except compensation payable by the regular employer under a work sharing plan. For the purposes of this subdivision, “regular employer” may include, pursuant to an approved plan, a labor organization that periodically employs individuals in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
                        <p>(m) Work sharing compensation shall be charged to employers’ experience rating accounts in the same manner as unemployment compensation is charged under this part. Employers liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall have work sharing compensation attributed to service in their employ in the same manner as unemployment compensation is attributed.</p>
                        <p>(n) The benefit payment under this section, if not a multiple of one dollar ($1), shall be increased to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).</p>
                        <p>(o) Except as otherwise provided by or inconsistent with this section, all provisions of this division and authorized regulations apply to benefits under this section. Authorized regulations may, to the extent permitted by federal law, make those distinctions and requirements as may be necessary in the procedures and provisions applicable to unemployed individuals to carry out the purposes of this section, including, but not limited to, regulations defining normal hours, days, workweeks, and wages.</p>
                        <p>(p) Employees shall not be eligible to receive any benefits under this section unless their employer agrees, in writing, and their bargaining agent pursuant to any applicable collective bargaining agreement agrees, in writing, to voluntarily participate in the work sharing program created by this section.</p>

                      <p>The Legislature finds that the traditional system of unemployment compensation is primarily designed to provide income support for workers who are temporarily laid off or expect to be unemployed for only a short time. However, increasing numbers of workers are losing their jobs permanently due to rapid technological change, elimination of trade barriers, and similar causes. These workers need additional tools besides the basic income maintenance provided by the unemployment compensation system in order to reenter the workforce. For some of those workers, access to a self-employment program would be the best path for them to do so. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this article to authorize the payment of unemployment compensation benefits, and to provide appropriate training and support services, for eligible dislocated workers who wish to become self-employed in their transition back into the workforce.</p>

                        <p>(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, if unemployment compensation benefit payments are directly deposited to an account of the recipient’s choice, as authorized under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1693 et seq.), the payments may only be deposited to an account that meets the requirements of a qualifying account, as defined in paragraph (2), for deposit of public assistance payments, including unemployment compensation benefits.</p>
                        <p>(2) For purposes of this section, a “qualifying account” is one of the following:</p>
                        <p>(A) A demand deposit or savings account at an insured financial institution in the name of the person entitled to receipt of public assistance payments.</p>
                        <p>(B) A prepaid card account that meets all of the following:</p>
                        <p>(i) The account is held at an insured financial institution.</p>
                        <p>(ii) The account is set up to meet the requirements for passthrough deposit or share insurance so that the funds accessible through the account are eligible for insurance for the benefit of the person entitled to the receipt of public assistance payments by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in accordance with Part 330 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in accordance with Part 745 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
                        <p>(iii) The account is not attached to any credit or overdraft feature that is automatically repaid from the account after delivery of the payment.</p>
                        <p>(iv) The issuer of the card complies with all of the requirements, and provides the holder of the card with all of the consumer protections, that apply to a payroll card account under the rules implementing the EFTA or other rules subsequently adopted under the EFTA that apply to prepaid card accounts.</p>
                        <p>(3) A person or entity that issues a prepaid card or maintains or manages a prepaid card account that does not comply with paragraph (2) shall not accept or facilitate the direct deposit of unemployment compensation benefit payments to the prepaid card account.</p>

                        <p>(3) “Payroll card account” shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in the regulations implementing the EFTA.</p>
                        <p>(4) “Prepaid card” or “prepaid card account” means either of the following:</p>
                        <p>(A) A card, code, or other means of access to funds of a recipient that is usable at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or usable at automated teller machines.</p>

                        <p>When an employer or any individual assessed under Section 1735 owes delinquent contributions, withholdings, penalty, or interest to the department, the director may enter into an agreement to accept partial payment in satisfaction of the full liability under the following conditions when he or she believes that it will be in the best interest of the state.</p>
                        <p>(1) Offers in compromise shall be considered only for liabilities of inactive out-of-business accounts, and of individuals assessed under Section 1735 or partners only if the individual assessed or partner no longer has a controlling interest or association with the business that incurred the liability to which the offer in compromise applies.</p>
                        <p>(2) The employer, individual assessed under Section 1735, or partner does not have access to current income sufficient to pay more than the accumulating interest and 6.7 percent of the liability on an annual basis.</p>
                        <p>(3) The employer, individual assessed under Section 1735, or partner does not have reasonable prospects of acquiring increased income or assets that would enable him or her to liquidate the liability in a reasonable period.</p>
                        <p>(4) The employer, individual assessed under Section 1735, or partner does not have assets, whether or not subjected to lien by the department, that if sold, would satisfy the liability.</p>
                        <p>(5) The amount offered in compromise is more than the department could reasonably expect to collect through involuntary means during the four-year period beginning on the date on which a compromise agreement is tendered by the employer, individual assessed under Section 1735, or partner.</p>
                        <p>(6) The compromise offer is submitted by the taxpayer in writing and is accompanied by cash, a cashier’s check, or money order equal to the amount offered in compromise.</p>
                        <p>(7) Only nondisputed, final tax liabilities shall be considered for compromise.</p>
                        <p>(8) Liabilities that arose as a result of fraud or actions that resulted in a conviction for a violation of this code shall not be compromised.</p>

                    <p>It is the intent of the Legislature in adopting this section to ensure that job order information registered with the Job Service of the Employment Development Department and the One-Stop Career Centers System be shared as expeditiously and thoroughly as possible between the department’s field offices and one-stop career centers both in the local labor market and throughout the state.</p>
                    <p>The Legislature finds that job order sharing will result in better service to employers and more efficient service to job seekers.</p>
                    <p>The provisions of this section shall be subject to the limitations of federal budgetary constraints.</p>

                    <p>It is the public policy of the State of California that manpower should be used to its fullest extent. This statement of policy compels the further conclusion that human beings seeking employment, or retention thereof, should be judged fairly and without resort to rigid and unsound rules that operate to disqualify significant portions of the population from gainful and useful employment. Accordingly, use by employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations of arbitrary and unreasonable rules which bar or terminate employment on the ground of age offend the public policy of this State.</p>

For the purpose of collection, an assessment made pursuant to this section may be treated as an overpayment. Assessments collected under this section shall be deposited in the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund.

                      <p>Except as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 2611, in determining the benefit rights of any industrially disabled person the disability base period shall exclude those quarters during which such person was industrially disabled for 60 days or more. For all quarters so excluded there shall be substituted an equal number of quarters immediately preceding the commencement of his or her industrial disability. In the event the base period so determined includes wages in calendar quarters for which the records have been destroyed under proper approval, a claimant may establish the amount of wages by affidavit in accordance with authorized regulations. The quarter of commencement of an industrial disability shall be counted as a completed quarter if the director finds that the inclusion thereof would be more equitable to the industrially disabled person.</p>

                      <p>The director shall, without presenting vouchers and itemized statements, withdraw from the Disability Fund any sums that he or she deems necessary for the payment of disability benefits for a reasonable future period. The Controller shall draw his or her warrant for any claim presented by the director for the payment and the Treasurer shall pay the warrant. Upon the withdrawal thereof, those sums shall be deposited in a disability benefit payment account in such bank or public depositary and under those conditions as the director determines, with the approval of the Department of Finance. The bank or public depositary shall be one in which general funds of the state may be deposited, but no public deposit insurance charge or premium shall be paid out of that account. Money in this account shall be used solely to pay disability benefits by the department pursuant to authorized regulations and no other disbursement shall be made from that account, except that amounts erroneously and illegally deposited in that account may be refunded. The procedure prescribed by those regulations shall satisfy and be in lieu of any and all statutory requirements of specific appropriation or other form of release by state officers of money in their custody prior to expenditure that might otherwise be applicable to withdrawals from that account.</p>

                      <p>The director may approve a single voluntary plan for all of an SBTPA’s clients and their employees where all of the following criteria are met:</p>
                      <p>(1) The plan is administered by the SBTPA.</p>
                      <p>(2) The plan establishes a master trust account that is administered by the SBTPA, and requires the SBTPA to maintain a separate accounting ledger for each individual employer that is a client of the SBTPA to reflect each client’s specific plan contributions. The master trust account shall be held in a federally insured bank.</p>
                      <p>(3) If the plan does not provide for the assumption by an admitted disability insurer of the liability of the employer to pay the benefits afforded by the plan, the director shall not approve it unless the SBTPA meets the financial security requirements of Section 3258 on behalf of the SBTPA clients and their employees.</p>
                      <p>(4) (A) The single voluntary plan will be in effect for a period of not less than one year and, thereafter, continuously, unless the Director of Employment Development finds that the SBTPA has given notice of withdrawal of the plan. The notice filed by the SBTPA shall be filed in writing with the Director of Employment Development and shall be effective on the anniversary of the effective date of the plan next following the filing of the notice, but in any event shall not be less than 30 days from the time of the filing of the notice; except that the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal from the plan is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of that law or change. If the plan is not withdrawn on the 30 days’ notice because of the enactment of a law increasing benefits or because of a change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, the plan shall be amended to conform to that increase or change on the operative date of the increase or change.</p>
                      <p>(B) Any individual employer who is a client of the SBTPA, or a majority of that client’s employees employed in this state covered by the plan, may also terminate their participation in the plan by giving written notice of withdrawal from the plan to the SBTPA and to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the date of withdrawal.</p>
                      <p>(C) The Director of Employment Development may terminate the participation of an individual employer client of the SBTPA from the plan for cause, and the employer’s voluntary plan assets shall be recovered from the SBTPA and not from the employer as referenced in Section 3262.</p>
                      <p>(5) The rights afforded to the covered employees are greater than those provided for in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 2625), including those provided for in Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 3300).</p>
                      <p>(6) The plan has been made available to all of the employees of the employer employed in this state or to all employees at any one distinct, separate establishment maintained by the employer in this state. “Employees” as used in this paragraph includes those individuals in partial or other forms of short-time employment and employees not in employment as the director shall prescribe by authorized regulations.</p>
                      <p>(7) A majority of the employees of the client employed in this state or a majority of the employees employed at any one distinct, separate establishment maintained by the client in this state have consented to the plan.</p>
                      <p>(8) If the plan provides for insurance, the form of the insurance policies to be issued has been approved by the Insurance Commissioner and is to be issued by an admitted disability insurer.</p>
                      <p>(9) The client has consented to the plan and has authorized the SBTPA to make the payroll deductions required, if any, and deposit the proceeds into the master account administered by the SBTPA as referenced in paragraph (2).</p>
                      <p>(10) The plan provides for the inclusion of future employees.</p>
                      <p>(11) The amount of deductions from the wages of an employee of any client in effect for the plan shall not be increased on other than an anniversary of the effective date of the plan except to the extent that any increase in the deductions from the wages of an employee allowed by Section 3260 permits that amount to exceed the amount of deductions in effect.</p>
                      <p>(12) The approval of the plan or plans will not result in a substantial selection of risks adverse to the Disability Fund.</p>

The successor employing unit and the insurer shall be deemed to have consented to the provisions of the plan unless written request for withdrawal, effective as of the date of acquisition, is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development, by the employer or the insurer, within 30 days after the acquisition date, or within 30 days after notification from the Director of Employment Development that the plan is to continue, whichever is later. Unless the plan is withdrawn as of the date of acquisition by the successor employer or the insurer, a written request for withdrawal shall be effective only on the anniversary of the effective date of the plan next occurring on or after the date of acquisition, except that the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal of the plan is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of law or change. If the plan is not withdrawn on 30 days’ notice because of the enactment of a law increasing benefits or because of a change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, the plan shall be amended to conform to the increase or change on the operative date of the increase or change. Promptly, upon notice of change in ownership, any insurer of a plan shall prepare and issue policy forms and amendments as required, unless the plan is withdrawn. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent future withdrawal of any plans on an anniversary of the effective date of the plan upon 30 days’ notice, except that the plan may be withdrawn on the operative date of any law increasing the benefit amounts provided by Sections 2653 and 2655 or the operative date of any change in the rate of worker contributions as determined by Section 984, if notice of the withdrawal of the plan is transmitted to the Director of Employment Development not less than 30 days prior to the operative date of the law or change.

Under the FMLA and the CFRA, unpaid leave may be taken for the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a new child; to care for a seriously ill child, parent, or spouse; or for the employee’s own serious health condition.</p>

                      <p>State disability insurance benefits currently provide wage replacement for workers who need time off due to their own nonwork-related injuries, illnesses, or conditions, including pregnancy, that prevent them from working, but do not cover leave to care for a sick or injured child, spouse, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or domestic partner, or leave to bond with a new child.</p>

                      <p>The majority of workers in this state are unable to take family care leave because they are unable to afford leave without pay. When workers do not receive some form of wage replacement during family care leave, families suffer from the worker’s loss of income, increasing the demand on the state unemployment insurance system and dependence on the state’s welfare system.</p>

This information need only be provided to the department. A copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military may be required by the department if the need for leave because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty or notification of an impending call or order to covered active duty of the same or a different family member.</p>

                        <p>(1) An employer that is entitled under Section 3654 to notice of the filing of a primary claim or additional claim and that, within 10 days after mailing of the notice, submits to the department any facts within its possession disclosing whether the exhaustee left the most recent employment with the employer voluntarily and without good cause or was discharged from the employment for misconduct connected with his or her work, or whether the claimant was a student employed on a temporary basis and whose employment began within, and ended with his or her leaving to return to school at the close of, his or her vacation period, or whether the claimant left the employer’s employ to accompany his or her spouse or domestic partner to a place or join him or her at a place from which it is impractical to commute to the employment, and to which a transfer of the claimant by the employer is not available, or whether the claimant’s discharge or quit from his or her most recent employer was the result of an irresistible compulsion to use or consume intoxicants, including alcoholic beverages, or whether the claimant left the employer’s employ to protect his or her family or himself or herself from domestic violence abuse, or whether the claimant left the employer’s employ to take a substantially better job, shall be entitled to a ruling as prescribed by this section. The period during which the employer may submit these facts may be extended by the director for good cause.</p>
                        <p>(2) For purposes of this section, “spouse” includes a person to whom marriage is imminent, and “domestic partner” includes a person to whom a domestic partnership, as described in Section 297 of the Family Code, is imminent.</p>

The 30-day period may be extended for good cause, which shall include, but not be limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The director shall be an interested party to an appeal.

                    <p>The purpose of this part is to provide that payment of extended compensation, in accordance with the “Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970”, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35), shall be made, for any week of unemployment which begins in the individual’s eligibility period, to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under this division and who have no rights to regular compensation with respect to such week under this division or any other state unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other federal law. For purposes of this section, an individual shall have exhausted his rights to regular compensation under any state law (A) when no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to him based on wage credits for his base period, or (B) when his rights to such compensation have terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed. Except where inconsistent with the provisions of the “Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970”, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35), the terms and conditions of this division which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof shall apply to claims for extended compensation and to the payment thereof under such federal act. This part shall be operative on September 25, 1982, and extended compensation shall be payable as provided by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35), subject to limitations provided by that act, with respect to weeks of unemployment and extended benefit periods beginning after September 25, 1982. The provisions of this section in effect prior to the amendments by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 shall continue to apply to weeks beginning after November 28, 1970, and before September 25, 1982.</p>

                        <p>(1) An employer that is entitled under Section 4654 to notice of the filing of an application or additional claim and who, within 10 days after mailing of the notice, submits to the department any facts within its possession disclosing whether the individual left the most recent employment with the employer voluntarily and without good cause or was discharged from the employment for misconduct connected with his or her work, or whether the claimant was a student employed on a temporary basis and whose employment began within, and ended with his or her leaving to return to school at the close of, his or her vacation period, or whether the claimant left the employer’s employ to accompany his or her spouse or domestic partner to a place or to join him or her at a place from which it is impractical to commute to the employment, and to which a transfer of the claimant by the employer is not available, or whether the claimant’s discharge or quit from his or her most recent employer was the result of an irresistible compulsion to use or consume intoxicants, including alcoholic beverages, or whether the claimant left the employer’s employ to protect his or her family or himself or herself from domestic violence abuse, or whether the claimant left the employer’s employ to take a substantially better job, shall be entitled to a ruling as prescribed by this section. The period during which the employer may submit these facts may be extended by the director for good cause.</p>
                        <p>(2) For purposes of this section, “spouse” includes a person to whom marriage is imminent, and “domestic partner” includes a person to whom a domestic partnership, as described in Section 297 of the Family Code, is imminent.</p>

The employer may appeal from a ruling or reconsidered ruling to an administrative law judge within 30 days after mailing or personal service of notice of the ruling or reconsidered ruling. The 30-day period may be extended for good cause, which shall include, but not be limited to, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The director shall be an interested party to an appeal. The department may for good cause reconsider a ruling or reconsidered ruling within either five days after the date an appeal to an administrative law judge is filed or, if no appeal is filed, within 30 days after mailing or personal service of notice of the ruling or reconsidered ruling, except that a ruling or reconsidered ruling that relates to a determination that is reconsidered pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1332 may also be reconsidered by the department within the time provided for reconsideration of that determination.</p>

                        <p>It is the further intent of the Legislature (a) to maintain policy control over all job training and placement programs administered by the department pursuant to this part to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with effective program operations, (b) to organize existing job training and placement programs now operating in the state into a coordinated system designed to remove employable persons from dependency on public assistance, and to enlist the full support of private industry in securing jobs, (c) to use funds for job training and placement services in a flexible manner to provide needed services for individuals through contractual arrangements with public and private agencies, (d) to provide a unified system for timely delivery of improved job training placement and related services to eligible persons including individual case responsibility, an outreach effort to seek out those persons who need but do not apply for services, followup to insure that the needs of eligible persons and their families are met, dissemination of information and knowledge to residents of the economically disadvantaged area about available services, and location of services in areas readily accessible to those who need them, and (e) to involve members of each community in identifying the needs to be met and relating them to the services available in order to reduce the isolation of the disadvantaged from their government and the community as a whole and to improve their confidence in government at all levels.</p>

                        <p>The Legislature finds and declares the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) Biotechnology represents one of the most promising, innovation-based growth industries of this era. California is the nation’s leading state in biotechnology innovation and production.</p>
                        <p>(2) The San Diego region, as the world’s third largest biotechnology industry cluster, is host to world-class generators of science and technology in biotechnology and the related life sciences.</p>
                        <p>(3) Despite the specialized nature of emerging biotechnology firms, their recent growth has been extensive, and with that growth has come an ever-increasing demand for trained biotechnology workers at all levels. The industry’s workforce has grown at an annual rate of about 15 percent over the past five years, and California’s biotechnology workforce could easily grow to over 250,000 by the year 2015 from its current level of 100,000.</p>
                        <p>(4) Biotechnology employers need entry-level and advanced professionals that have a background in, and familiarity with, industrylike conditions for basic, applied, and translational research, development, and production. Based on recent studies, there is a clear and strong demand for applied bioscience training, but that demand is currently not being met by the region’s universities and colleges.</p>
                        <p>(5) Companies nationally have overwhelmingly endorsed an “industry-focused” approach of providing internship training programs directly with the companies, combined with “company-like” training activities.</p>
                        <p>(6) Many firms have identified the difficulty in finding entry level biotechnology workers at both the graduate and undergraduate levels as being directly related to the students’ lack of applied industry training or exposure. Many firms have had to extensively train new employees to teach them how to function in a biotechnology business environment. Additionally, nearly three-fourths of firms surveyed in San Diego and nationally have indicated that they would benefit from being able to hire workers that have been prepared to enter the workforce through advanced biotechnology internships and training of a “specific” nature.</p>
                        <p>(7) San Diego and the surrounding area is served by many well-recognized academic institutions, from community colleges to universities offering doctorate programs, that supply educated workers to the biotechnology industry. At each academic level (AA, BS/BA, MS/MA, Ph.D.) curricula are in place, but most of the curricula are only marginally related to biotechnology workforce preparation in the applied sector. Applied education in the form of internships or instruction in practical science skills that would smooth the transition from academic institutions to the commercial biotechnology environment is even less prevalent than the biotechnology curricula offered at many schools, and is only now just emerging.</p>
                        <p>(8) Many of California’s firms have found that many students graduate from four-year university programs with adequate conceptual understanding of biotechnology, but with relatively little practical laboratory experience, especially in the skills and protocols that are specific to commercial ventures as opposed to academic research.</p>
                        <p>(9) In 2001, the Legislature created the Pasadena Bioscience Center to address biotechnology workforce needs in the Los Angeles region. The Pasadena Bioscience Center provides applied workforce training and includes components for research and innovation, new business incubation, and bioinformatics. In cooperation with California State University, the City of Pasadena, Pasadena City College, the California Institute of Technology, Huntington Medical Research Institutes, and local biotechnology companies and organizations, the Pasadena Bioscience Center serves as a successful model of focused education and training, tailored to specific industry needs, and that may be utilized in other areas of the state.</p>

                        <p>The Legislature further finds and declares that to address workforce needs in biotechnology, a multiuse biotechnology training center is being created in San Diego to serve as an anchor and catalyst for the growth of biotechnology enterprises in San Diego. The center will operate as a nonprofit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and will serve as a catalyst for accelerating the growth and formation of new bioscience enterprises that will create value-added jobs and high economic multipliers in the San Diego region. For this purpose:</p>
                        <p>(1) The center will provide state-of-the-art, industry-oriented bioscience training and act as a strong contributor to the growth and retention of bioscience companies in the region. As such, the center, as proposed, will help encourage biotechnology companies to remain in the region, thereby offsetting the pull of other, less expensive business environments that have been recruiting both startup and existing local area bioscience companies.</p>
                        <p>(2) The center will utilize the organization, programs, and work of the Pasadena Bioscience Center as successful models in the development of the San Diego Multiuse Biotechnology Training Center and its programs.</p>
                        <p>(3) The new center will serve as a world class biotechnology workforce training facility offering practical, hands-on learning experiences, including short-term workshops and courses, and more extended training that will involve putting together multidisciplinary, multilevel teams of researchers, technicians, production specialists, apprentices, and students to work in a businesslike environment.</p>
                        <p>(4) The center will coordinate an extensive applied biotechnology internship program that will place students in local biotechnology companies for practical training and experience.</p>
                        <p>(5) The center will have the most relevant and advanced training possible, including an emphasis in bioinformatics, that will ensure that the center attains a position at the forefront of this rapidly expanding, cross-application specialization within biotechnology.</p>
                        <p>(6) The center will have facilities and a collection of instruments not generally available to the region’s secondary schools, colleges, or universities.</p>
                        <p>(7) The center can serve as a capstone training site for regional institutions.</p>
                        <p>(8) The center will address the needs of existing as well as future industry employees.</p>
                        <p>(9) The center may appoint directors to a board of directors, and existing participants in the center may serve as the original board of directors. The center may appoint new directors, as necessary, in its discretion.</p>
                        <p>(10) The center will work with private universities, companies, associations, and various public agencies through memoranda of understanding under Section 9702, for the purpose of coordinating services and receiving assistance and support.</p>

                      <p>California’s economy is being challenged by competition from other states and overseas. In order to meet this challenge, California’s employers, workers, labor organizations, and government need to invest in a skilled and productive workforce, and in developing the skills of frontline workers. For purposes of this section, “frontline worker” means a worker who directly produces or delivers goods or services.</p>
                      <p>The purpose of this chapter is to establish a strategically designed employment training program to promote a healthy labor market in a growing, competitive economy that shall fund only projects that meet the following criteria:</p>
                      <p>(1) Foster creation of high-wage, high-skilled jobs, or foster retention of high-wage, high-skilled jobs in manufacturing and other industries that are threatened by out-of-state and global competition, including, but not limited to, those industries in which targeted training resources for California’s small and medium-sized business suppliers will increase the state’s competitiveness to secure federal, private sector, and other nonstate funds. In addition, provide for retraining contracts in companies that make a monetary or in-kind contribution to the funded training enhancements.</p>
                      <p>(2) Encourage industry-based investment in human resources development that promotes the competitiveness of California industry through productivity and product quality enhancements.</p>
                      <p>(3) Result in secure jobs for those who successfully complete training. All training shall be customized to the specific requirements of one or more employers or a discrete industry and shall include general skills, including soft skills, that trainees can use in the future.</p>
                      <p>(4) Supplement, rather than displace, funds available through existing programs conducted by employers and government-funded training programs, such as the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2801 et seq.), the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act (Public Law 98-524), CalWORKs (Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 11200) of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code), the Enterprise Zone Act (Chapter 12.8 (commencing with Section 7070) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code), and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11301 et seq.), the California Community Colleges Economic Development Program, or apportionment funds allocated to the community colleges, regional occupational centers and programs, or other local educational agencies. In addition, it is further the intention of the Legislature that programs developed pursuant to this chapter shall not replace, parallel, supplant, compete with, or duplicate in any way already existing approved apprenticeship programs.</p>

                      <p>The Employment Training Panel, in funding projects that meet the requirements of subdivision (a), shall give funding priority to those projects that best meet the following goals:</p>
                      <p>(1) Result in the growth of the California economy by stimulating exports from the state and the production of goods and services that would otherwise be imported from outside the state.</p>
                      <p>(2) Train new employees of firms locating or expanding in the state that provide high-skilled, high-wage jobs and are committed to an ongoing investment in the training of frontline workers.</p>
                      <p>(3) Develop workers with skills that prepare them for the challenges of a high-performance workplace of the future.</p>
                      <p>(4) Train workers who have been displaced, have received notification of impending layoff, or are subject to displacement, because of a plant closure, workforce reduction, changes in technology, or significantly increasing levels of international and out-of-state competition.</p>
                      <p>(5) Are jointly developed by business management and worker representatives.</p>
                      <p>(6) Develop career ladders for workers.</p>
                      <p>(7) Promote the retention and expansion of the state’s manufacturing workforce.</p>

                      <p>The program established through this chapter is to be coordinated with all existing employment training programs and economic development programs, including, but not limited to, programs such as the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C.

                      <p>(3) A system for expedited review of proposals that are substantially similar with respect to employer needs, training curriculum, duration of training, and costs of training, in order to encourage the development of proposals that meet the needs identified in paragraph (2).</p>
                      <p>(4) The panel’s goals, operational objectives, and strategies to meet the needs of small businesses, including, but not limited to, those small businesses with 100 or fewer employees.

                      <p>(5) The research objectives of the panel that contribute to the effectiveness of this chapter in benefiting the economy of the state as a whole.</p>
                      <p>(6) A priority list of skills or occupations that are in such short supply that employers are choosing to not locate or expand their businesses in the state or are importing labor in response to these skills shortages.</p>
                      <p>(7) A review of the panel’s efforts to coordinate with the California Workforce Investment Board and local boards to achieve an effective and coordinated approach in the delivery of the state’s workforce resources.</p>
                      <p>(A) The panel will consider specific strategies to achieve this goal that include the development of initiatives to engage local workforce investment boards in enhancing the utilization of panel training resources by companies in priority sectors, special populations, and in geographically underserved areas of the state.</p>
                      <p>(B) Various approaches to foster greater program integration between workforce investment boards and the panel will also be considered, which may include marketing agreements, expanded technical assistance, modification of program regulations and policy, and expanded use of multiple employer contracts.</p>

The cost of administration shall not exceed 15 percent of the training costs under this paragraph, except that for new hire training the panel may fund administrative costs of up to 25 percent of the training cost.</p>
                      <p>(C) The panel may modify the specific requirements of this paragraph as they apply to employers or contractors proposing projects that involve training for a significant number of small employers in the same project.</p>
                      <p>(D) A contractor is prohibited from utilizing any funds earned or paid as advances or progress payments for the purpose of making payments to any other individual or entity, either directly or indirectly, for costs incurred as a finder’s fee or for other compensation related to the predevelopment or development phase of a training program, which is based on a percentage of the preliminary or final panel award to the contractor for the training project.</p>
                      <p>(2) (A) Costs of program administration incurred under this chapter. These costs shall be reviewed annually by the Department of Finance and the Legislature and determined through the normal budgetary process.</p>
                      <p>(B) The panel’s administrative costs, exclusive of the cost of administering Section 976.6, shall not exceed 15 percent of the total amount annually appropriated for expenditure by the panel. Expenditures for marketing, research, and evaluations provided under the contract to the panel that otherwise would have been provided directly by the panel shall not be included in this limitation.</p>

                    <p>The Legislature finds that over 1.5 million persons in California are deaf or significantly hard of hearing. Private and public employment agencies are not routinely adapted to meet the communication needs of persons who are deaf and hard of hearing and, therefore, the services they receive may be less than those provided to other persons. The Legislature also finds that employment opportunities for persons who are deaf and hard of hearing are increased when specialized counseling, interpretive, job placement, and followup services supplement conventional employment services. In addition, the limited programs that provide these specialized employment services to persons who are deaf and hard of hearing have recently been subject to significant local funding reductions. Therefore, the Legislature finds that a more stable funding source, as provided by this chapter, is necessary to ensure the continuance of these programs.</p>

                    <p>(1) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (c), for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 1995, if in the 12-month period ending June 30 of the prior year, the cumulative average payment made pursuant to this division or Section 1110 for any deposit periods, as described under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, was twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or more, the employer shall remit the total amount of income tax withheld within the number of business days as specified for filing federal income taxes by Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to mode or time of collection, and regulations thereunder. For purposes of this subdivision, payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer in accordance with Section 13021.5, for one calendar year beginning on January 1. Payment is deemed complete on the date the electronic funds transfer is initiated if settlement to the state’s demand account occurs on or before the business day following the date the transfer is initiated. If settlement to the state’s demand account does not occur on or before the business day following the date the transfer is initiated, payment is deemed complete on the date settlement occurs. The department shall, on or before October 31 of the prior year, notify all employers required by this paragraph to make payments by electronic funds transfer of these requirements.</p>
                    <p>(2) Effective January 1, 2017, paragraph (1) shall not apply to an employer subject to the electronic filing requirements of Section 1088. Effective January 1, 2017, an employer subject to the electronic filing requirements of Section 1088 shall remit the total amount of income tax withheld within the number of business days specified in Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations adopted thereunder for filing federal income taxes. Payment shall be deemed complete on the date the electronic funds transfer is initiated if settlement to the state’s demand account occurs on or before the business day following the date the transfer is initiated. If settlement to the state’s demand account does not occur on or before the business day following the date the transfer is initiated, payment is deemed complete on the date settlement occurs.</p>
                    <p>(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), effective January 1, 1995, electronic funds transfer payments that are subject to the one-day deposit rule, as described by Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, shall be deemed timely if the payment settles to the state’s demand account within three business days after the date the employer meets the threshold for the one-day deposit rule.</p>
                    <p>(4) Any taxpayer required to remit payments pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) may request from the department a waiver of those requirements. The department may grant a waiver only if it determines that the particular amount paid in excess of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), as stated in paragraph (1) was the result of an unprecedented occurrence for that employer, and was not representative of the employer’s cumulative average payment in prior years.</p>
                    <p>(5) A state agency required to remit payments pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) may request a waiver of those requirements from the department. The department may grant a waiver if it determines that there will not be a negative impact on the interest earnings of the General Fund. If there is a negative impact to the General Fund, the department may grant a waiver if the requesting state agency follows procedures designated by the department to mitigate the impact to the General Fund.</p>

                  <p>In the case of tips which constitute wages, subdivision (a) of Section 13020 shall be applicable only to such tips as are included in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to Section 13055, and only to the extent that the tax can be deducted and withheld by the employer, at or after the time such statement is so furnished and before the close of the calendar year in which such statement is furnished, from such wages of the employee (excluding tips, but including funds turned over by the employee to the employer for the purpose of such deduction and withholding) as are under the control of the employer. An employer who is furnished by an employee a written statement of tips (received in a calendar month) pursuant to Section 13055 to which paragraph (2) of subdivision (n) of Section 13009 is applicable may deduct and withhold the tax with respect to such tips from any wages of the employee (excluding tips) under his or her control, even though at the time such statement is furnished the total amount of the tips included in statements furnished to the employer as having been received by the employee in such calendar month in the course of his or her employment by the employer is less than twenty dollars ($20). Such tax shall not at any time be deducted and withheld in any amount which exceeds the aggregate of such wages and funds.</p>

                    <p>(D) Preparing workers for good-paying jobs that foster economic security and upward mobility.</p>

                    <p>(A) Adopting local and regional training and education strategies which include workplace-based earn and learn programs that build on the strengths and fill the gaps in the education and workforce development pipeline in order to address the needs of job seekers, workers, and employers within regional labor markets by supporting sector strategies.</p>
                    <p>(B) Leveraging resources across education and workforce training delivery systems to build career pathways and fill critical skills gaps.</p>
                    <p>(3) Workforce investment programs and services shall be data driven and evidence based when setting priorities, investing resources, and adopting practices.</p>
                    <p>(4) Workforce investment programs and services shall develop strong partnerships with the private sector, ensuring industry involvement in needs assessment, planning, and program evaluation.</p>
                    <p>(A) Workforce investment programs and services shall encourage industry involvement by developing strong partnerships with an industry’s employers and the unions that represent the industry’s workers.</p>
                    <p>(B) Workforce investment programs and services may consider the needs of employers and businesses of all sizes, including large, medium, small, and microenterprises, when setting priorities, investing resources, and adopting practices.</p>
                    <p>(5) Workforce investment programs and services shall be outcome oriented and accountable, measuring results for program participants, including, but not limited to, outcomes related to program completion, employment, and earnings.</p>
                    <p>(6) Programs and services shall be accessible to employers, the self-employed, workers, and students who may benefit from their operation, including individuals with employment barriers, such as persons with economic, physical, or other barriers to employment.</p>

                      <p>The development and updating of comprehensive state performance accountability measures, including state-adjusted levels of performance, to assess the effectiveness of the core programs in the state as required under Section 3141(b) of Title 29 of the United States Code. As part of this process the board shall do all of the following:</p>
                      <p>(1) Develop a workforce metrics dashboard, to be updated annually, that measures the state’s human capital investments in workforce development to better understand the collective impact of these investments on the labor market. The board shall determine the approach for measuring labor market impacts, provided that, to the extent feasible, the board uses statistically rigorous methodologies to estimate, assess, and isolate the impact of programs on participant outcomes. The workforce metrics dashboard shall be produced, to the extent feasible, using existing available data and resources that are currently collected and accessible to state agencies. The board shall convene workforce program partners to develop a standardized set of inputs and outputs for the workforce metrics dashboard. The workforce metrics dashboard shall do all of the following:</p>
                      <p>(A) Provide a status report on credential attainment, training completion, degree attainment, and participant earnings from workforce education and training programs. The board shall publish and distribute the final report.</p>
                      <p>(B) Provide demographic breakdowns, including, to the extent possible, race, ethnicity, age, gender, veteran status, wage and credential or degree outcomes, and information on workforce outcomes in different industry sectors.</p>
                      <p>(C) Measure, at a minimum and to the extent feasible with existing resources, the performance of the following workforce programs: community college career technical education, the Employment Training Panel, Title I and Title II of the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-220), Title I and Title II of the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-128), Trade Adjustment Assistance, and state apprenticeship programs.</p>
                      <p>(D) Measure participant earnings in California, and to the extent feasible, in other states. The Employment Development Department shall assist the board by calculating aggregated participant earnings using unemployment insurance wage records, without violating any applicable confidentiality requirements.</p>
                      <p>(2) The State Department of Education is hereby authorized to collect the social security numbers of adults participating in adult education programs so that accurate participation in those programs can be represented in the workforce metrics dashboard. However, an individual shall not be denied program participation if he or she refuses to provide a social security number. The State Department of Education shall keep this information confidential, except, the State Department of Education is authorized to share this information, unless prohibited by federal law, with the Employment Development Department, the board, or the board’s designee, who shall keep the information confidential and use it only to track the labor market and other outcomes described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of program participants in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and mandates, including all performance reporting requirements under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.</p>
                      <p>(3) (A) Participating workforce programs, including, but not limited to, those specified in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1), shall provide participant data in a standardized format to the Employment Development Department, the board, or the board’s designee.</p>
                      <p>(B) The Employment Development Department, the board, or the board’s designee, shall aggregate data provided by participating workforce programs and shall report the data, organized by demographics, earnings, and industry of employment, to the board to assist the board in producing the annual workforce metrics dashboard.</p>
                      <p>(4) The board shall ensure that a designee has the technical and operational capability of meeting appropriate privacy and security requirements.</p>

                      <p>In order to support the requirement of the plans in subdivision (a), the California Workforce Development Board shall do the following:</p>
                      <p>(1) Identify industry sectors and industry clusters that have a competitive economic advantage and demonstrated economic importance to the state and its regional economies. In developing this analysis, the California Workforce Development Board shall consider the expertise of local workforce development boards in the state’s respective regional economies and shall encourage the local workforce development boards to identify industry sectors and industry clusters that have a competitive economic advantage and demonstrated economic importance in their respective local workforce development areas.</p>
                      <p>(2) Identify new dynamic emergent industry sectors and industry clusters with substantial potential to generate new jobs and income growth for the state and its regional economies. In developing this analysis, the California Workforce Development Board shall consider the expertise of local workforce development boards in the state’s respective regional economies and shall encourage the local workforce development boards to identify new dynamic emergent industry sectors and industry clusters with substantial potential to generate new jobs and income growth in their respective local workforce development areas.</p>
                      <p>(3) Provide a skills-gap analysis enumerating occupational and skills shortages in the industry sectors and industry clusters identified as having strategic importance to the state’s economy and its regional economies. In developing this analysis, the California Workforce Development Board shall consider the expertise of local workforce development boards in the state’s respective regional economies and shall encourage the local workforce development boards to conduct skills-gap analysis for their respective local workforce development areas. Skills-gap analysis for the state and its regional economies shall use labor market data to specify a list of high-priority, in-demand occupations for the state and its regional economies. This list shall be used to inform investment decisions and eligible training provider policies.</p>
                      <p>(4) Establish, with input from local workforce development boards and other stakeholders, initial and subsequent eligibility criteria for the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 eligible training provider list that effectively directs training resources into training programs leading to employment in high-demand, high-priority, and occupations that provide economic security, particularly those facing a shortage of skilled workers. The subsequent eligibility criteria, to the extent feasible, shall use performance and outcome measures to determine whether a provider is qualified to remain on the list. At a minimum, initial and subsequent eligibility criteria shall consider the following:</p>
                      <p>(A) The relevance of the training program to the workforce needs of the state’s strategic industry sectors and industry clusters.</p>
                      <p>(B) The need to plug skills gaps and skills shortages in the economy, including skills gaps and skills shortages at the state and regional level.</p>
                      <p>(C) The need to plug skills gaps and skills shortages in local workforce development areas.</p>
                      <p>(D) The likelihood that the training program will lead to job placement in a job providing economic security or job placement in an entry-level job that has a well-articulated career pathway or career ladder to a job providing economic security.</p>
                      <p>(E) The need for basic skills in combination with programs that provide occupational skills training for individuals with barriers to employment and those who would otherwise be unable to enter occupational skills training.</p>
                      <p>(F) To the extent feasible, utilize criteria that measure training and education provider performance, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
                      <p>(i) Measures of skills or competency attainment.</p>
                      <p>(ii) Measures relevant to program completion, including measures of course, certificate, degree, licensure, and program of study rate of completion.</p>
                      <p>(iii) For those entering the labor market, measures of employment placement and retention.</p>
                      <p>(iv) For those continuing in training or education, measures of educational or training progression.</p>
                      <p>(v) For those who have entered the labor market, measures of income, including wage measures.</p>
                      <p>(G) The division of labor for making initial and subsequent eligibility determinations under this division shall be modeled on the division of labor envisioned in the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014.</p>
                      <p>(H) If the state receives a waiver from the federal subsequent eligibility provisions specified in the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014, the state workforce development board shall establish its own subsequent eligibility criteria that take into account all of the criteria specified in subparagraphs (A) to (G), inclusive.</p>

                      <p>(B) Is consistent with the California Workforce Development Board State Plan.</p>
                      <p>(C) Describes the actions that the board shall take to implement local policies in furtherance of its goals.</p>
                      <p>(D) Serves as a written account of intended future courses of action aimed at achieving the specific goals of the local and state board within a specific timeframe.</p>
                      <p>(E) Explains what needs to be done, by whom, and when each action is required to occur in order to meet those goals.</p>
                      <p>(4) Demonstrate that the local planning process involves key stakeholders, including the major employers and industry groups in the relevant regional economy and organized labor.</p>
                      <p>(5) Demonstrate that the local planning process takes into account the entire workforce training pipeline for the relevant regional economy, including partners in K-12 education, career technical education, the community college system, other postsecondary institutions, and other local workforce development areas operating in the relevant regional economy.</p>
                      <p>(6) Demonstrate that the local planning process and plan are data driven, and that policy decisions at the local level are evidence based. Each high-performance local workforce development board shall use labor market data to develop and implement the local plan, taking care to steer resources into programs and services that are relevant to the needs of each workforce development area’s relevant regional labor market and high-wage industry sectors. Local workforce development areas shall demonstrate an evidence-based approach to policymaking by establishing performance benchmarks and targets to measure progress toward local goals and objectives.</p>
                      <p>(7) Demonstrate investment in workforce initiatives, and, specifically, training programs that promote skills development and career ladders relevant to the needs of each workforce investment area’s regional labor market and high-wage industry sectors.</p>
                      <p>(8) Establish a youth strategy aligned with the needs of each workforce investment area’s regional labor market and high-wage industry sectors.</p>
                      <p>(9) Establish a business service plan that integrates local business involvement with workforce initiatives. This plan at a minimum shall include all of the following:</p>
                      <p>(A) Efforts to partner with businesses to identify the workforce training and educational barriers to attract jobs in the relevant regional economy, existing skill gaps reducing the competitiveness of local businesses in the relevant regional economies, and potential emerging industries that would likely contribute to job growth in the relevant regional economy if investments were made for training and educational programs.</p>
                      <p>(B) An electronic system for both businesses and job seekers to communicate about job opportunities.</p>
                      <p>(C) A subcommittee of the local workforce development board that further develops and makes recommendations for the business service plan for each local workforce development board in an effort to increase employer involvement in the activities of the local workforce development board. The subcommittee members should be comprised of business representatives on the local workforce development board who represent both the leading industries and employers in the relevant regional economy and potential emerging sectors that have significant potential to contribute to job growth in the relevant regional economy if investments were made for training and educational programs.</p>

                  <p>The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) The State of California has long been a national and international leader on environmental, natural resource, pollution prevention, and energy issues, as well as recent landmark laws in the areas of climate change, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and alternative transportation fuels.</p>
                  <p>(2) The passage of these laws has resulted in billions of dollars of investment capital flowing into the State of California for research, development, and commercialization of new green and clean technologies. This investment of capital is indicative of the rapidly growing clean and green technology sector of the California economy.</p>
                  <p>(3) California’s green economy is about the potential of new technologies combined with innovative public policy and strategic investments to stimulate the growth of new markets for green products and services.</p>
                  <p>(4) As the green economy grows, it will be accompanied by an increased demand for a highly skilled and well-trained “green collar” workforce.</p>
                  <p>(5) California state government must act promptly to build the partnerships, expand the programs, and secure the resources necessary to meet our green workforce needs. This effort must involve both our K-12 and higher education systems, labor unions, the environmental community, workforce development programs, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropy, and private sector industries.</p>
                  <p>(6) In acknowledgment of the tremendous size of California’s economy and related infrastructure, the application of sector strategies in a wide variety of industry sectors is essential to providing labor for industry and career paths for current and potential employees. The California Workforce Investment Board shall adopt a sector strategy approach in responding to industry sector workforce and economic development needs. This strategy will ensure industry has a qualified workforce and can offer opportunities for employment, training, and career advancement for all Californians. The initial drive of this sector strategy approach will be the California Green Collar Jobs Act of 2008.</p>

                  <p>(5) Develop, collect, analyze, and distribute statewide and regional labor market data on California’s new and emerging green industries workforce needs, trends, and job growth.</p>
                  <p>(6) Collaborate with community colleges and other educational institutions, registered apprenticeship programs, business and labor organizations, and community-based and philanthropic organizations to align workforce development services with strategies for regional economic growth.</p>
