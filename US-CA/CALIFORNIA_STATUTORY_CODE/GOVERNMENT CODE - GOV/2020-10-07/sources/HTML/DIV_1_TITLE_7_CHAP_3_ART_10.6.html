A key factor in addressing this crisis is to significantly increase housing production in all cities and counties across the state.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(2) The general plan of the County of Napa has designated significant amounts of land in the county as agricultural resources and agricultural watershed or open-space. A voter-approved initiative prohibits the redesignation of land designated as an agricultural
						resource or agricultural watershed or open-space without voter approval unless certain narrow exemptions apply. Due to the lack of urban services, including the provision of water and wastewater services, and infrastructure, the County of Napa has generally been concentrated in or around incorporated areas rather than in remote or rural locations in order to ensure adequate service connections.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(3) The Napa Pipe project, which has been in the planning phase for nearly a decade, was initially located on unincorporated land in the county, but the City of Napa is annexing the property in phases as development moves forward.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(4) The developer has requested an amendment to the Napa Pipe project approvals to prioritize housing in the first phase of the project.

Since the county approved the project, the project’s intent has been for the county to help fund the construction of affordable units in the project while counting any constructed affordable and moderate-income housing units toward the county’s regional housing need allocation before the annexation. Because the project now envisions developing housing units on portions of the project site that have already been annexed by the city, the project

The excessive cost of the state’s housing supply is partially caused by activities and policies of many local governments that limit the approval of housing, increase the cost of land for housing, and require that high fees and exactions be paid by producers of housing.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(C) Among the consequences of those actions are
				  discrimination against low-income and minority households, lack of housing to support employment growth, imbalance in jobs and housing, reduced mobility, urban sprawl, excessive commuting, and air quality deterioration.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(D) Many local governments do not give adequate attention to the economic, environmental, and social costs of decisions that result in disapproval of housing development projects, reduction in density of housing projects, and excessive standards for housing development projects.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(2) In enacting the amendments made to this section by the act adding this paragraph, the Legislature further finds and declares the following:</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(A) California has a housing supply and affordability crisis of historic proportions. The consequences of failing to effectively and aggressively confront this crisis are hurting
				  millions of Californians, robbing future generations of the chance to call California home, stifling economic opportunities for workers and businesses, worsening poverty and homelessness, and undermining the state’s environmental and climate objectives.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(B) While the causes of this crisis are multiple and complex, the absence of meaningful and effective policy reforms to significantly enhance the approval and supply of housing affordable to Californians of all income levels is a key factor.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(C) The crisis has grown so acute in California that supply, demand, and affordability fundamentals are characterized in the negative: underserved demands, constrained supply, and protracted unaffordability.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(D) According to reports and data, California has accumulated an unmet housing backlog of nearly 2,000,000 units and must
				  provide for at least 180,000 new units annually to keep pace with growth through 2025.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(E) California’s overall homeownership rate is at its lowest level since the 1940s. The state ranks 49th out of the 50 states in homeownership rates as well as in the supply of housing per capita. Only one-half of California’s households are able to afford the cost of housing in their local regions.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(F) Lack of supply and rising costs are compounding inequality and limiting advancement opportunities for many Californians.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(G) The majority of California renters, more than 3,000,000 households, pay more than 30 percent of their income toward rent and nearly one-third, more than 1,500,000 households, pay more than 50 percent of their income toward rent.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(H) When
				  Californians have access to safe and affordable housing, they have more money for food and health care; they are less likely to become homeless and in need of government-subsidized services; their children do better in school; and businesses have an easier time recruiting and retaining employees.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(I) An additional consequence of the state’s cumulative housing shortage is a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by the displacement and redirection of populations to states with greater housing opportunities, particularly working- and middle-class households. California’s cumulative housing shortfall therefore has not only national but international environmental consequences.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(J) California’s housing picture has reached a crisis of historic proportions despite the fact that, for decades, the Legislature has enacted numerous statutes intended to significantly
				  increase the approval, development, and affordability of housing for all income levels, including this section.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(K) The Legislature’s intent in enacting this section in 1982 and in expanding its provisions since then was to significantly increase the approval and construction of new housing for all economic segments of California’s communities by meaningfully and effectively curbing the capability of local governments to deny, reduce the density for, or render infeasible housing development projects and emergency shelters. That intent has not been fulfilled.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(L) It is the policy of the state that this section be interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible weight to the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(3) It is the intent of the Legislature that the conditions that
				  would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety, as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) and paragraph (1) of subdivision (j), arise infrequently.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(b) It is the policy of the state that a local government not reject or make infeasible housing development projects, including emergency shelters, that contribute to meeting the need determined pursuant to this article without a thorough analysis of the economic, social, and environmental effects of the action and without complying with subdivision (d).</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(c) The Legislature also recognizes that premature and unnecessary development of agricultural lands for urban uses continues to have adverse effects on the availability of those lands for food and fiber production and on the economy of the state. Furthermore, it is the policy of the state that development should be guided away from prime agricultural
				  lands; therefore, in implementing this section, local jurisdictions should encourage, to the maximum extent practicable, in filling existing urban areas.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(d) A local agency shall not disapprove a housing development project, including farmworker housing as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 50199.7 of the Health and Safety Code, for very low, low-, or moderate-income households, or an emergency shelter, or condition approval in a manner that renders the housing development project infeasible for development for the use of very low, low-, or moderate-income households, or an emergency shelter, including through the use of design review standards, unless it makes written findings, based upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record, as to one of the following:</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(1) The jurisdiction has adopted a housing element pursuant to this article that has been revised in accordance with
				  Section 65588, is in substantial compliance with this article, and the jurisdiction has met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need allocation pursuant to Section 65584 for the planning period for the income category proposed for the housing development project, provided that any disapproval or conditional approval shall not be based on any of the reasons prohibited by Section 65008. If the housing development project includes a mix of income categories, and the jurisdiction has not met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need for one or more of those categories, then this paragraph shall not be used to disapprove or conditionally approve the housing development project. The share of the regional housing need met by the jurisdiction shall be calculated consistently with the forms and definitions that may be adopted by the Department of Housing and Community Development pursuant to Section 65400. In the case of an emergency shelter, the jurisdiction shall have met or exceeded the need for
				  emergency shelter, as identified pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583. Any disapproval or conditional approval pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with applicable law, rule, or standards.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(2) The housing development project or emergency shelter as proposed would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households or rendering the development of the emergency shelter financially infeasible. As used in this paragraph, a “specific, adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. The following shall not constitute a
				  specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety:</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(A) Inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(B) The eligibility to claim a welfare exemption under subdivision (g) of Section 214 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(3) The denial of the housing development project or imposition of conditions is required in order to comply with specific state or federal law, and there is no feasible method to comply without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households or rendering the development of the emergency shelter financially infeasible.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(4) The housing development project or emergency shelter is proposed on land zoned for agriculture or resource preservation that is surrounded on at
				  least two sides by land being used for agricultural or resource preservation purposes, or which does not have adequate water or wastewater facilities to serve the project.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(5) The housing development project or emergency shelter is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation as specified in any element of the general plan as it existed on the date the application was deemed complete, and the jurisdiction has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with Section 65588 that is in substantial compliance with this article. For purposes of this section, a change to the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation subsequent to the date the application was deemed complete shall not constitute a valid basis to disapprove or condition approval of the housing development project or emergency shelter.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(A) This paragraph
				  cannot be utilized to disapprove or conditionally approve a housing development project if the housing development project is proposed on a site that is identified as suitable or available for very low, low-, or moderate-income households in the jurisdiction’s housing element, and consistent with the density specified in the housing element, even though it is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(B) If the local agency has failed to identify in the inventory of land in its housing element sites that can be developed for housing within the planning period and are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need for all income levels pursuant to Section 65584, then this paragraph shall not be utilized to disapprove or conditionally approve a housing development project proposed for a site designated in any element of the general plan for residential uses
				  or designated in any element of the general plan for commercial uses if residential uses are permitted or conditionally permitted within commercial designations. In any action in court, the burden of proof shall be on the local agency to show that its housing element does identify adequate sites with appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities to accommodate the local agency’s share of the regional housing need for the very low, low-, and moderate-income categories.</p><p style="margin:0 0 0.5em 0;clear:both;"/><p style="margin:0;display:inline;">(C) If the local agency has failed to identify a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit, has failed to demonstrate that the identified zone or zones include sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for emergency shelter identified in paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583, or has failed to demonstrate that the identified zone or zones can accommodate
				  at least one emergency shelter, as required by paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583, then this paragraph shall not be utilized to disapprove or conditionally approve an emergency shelter proposed for a site designated in any element of the general plan for industrial, commercial, or multifamily residential uses.
