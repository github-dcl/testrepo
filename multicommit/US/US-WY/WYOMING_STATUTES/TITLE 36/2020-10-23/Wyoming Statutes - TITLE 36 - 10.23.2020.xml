                  <p>(a) By W.S. 19-7-301, the legislature of the state of Wyoming ceded exclusive jurisdiction to what was then known as Fort Francis E. Warren, now referred to as Warren Air Force Base and at the same time, exclusive jurisdiction was extended to future additions to such post. The Pole Mountain district of the Medicine Bow national forest was set aside for military purposes by Executive Order No. 4245, dated June 5, 1925, as amended by Public Land Order No. 1897, dated July 10, 1959. Use for military purposes terminated in accordance with Public Land Order No. 2446, dated July 20, 1961.</p>
                  <p>(b) By the act of August 27, 1964 (Public Law 88-494, 78 Stat. 611) the secretary of agriculture was authorized to relinquish to the state of Wyoming such measure of legislative jurisdiction as he deemed desirable over such lands. On December 24, 1964, Orville L. Freeman, secretary of the department of agriculture, United States of America, notified the governor of the state of Wyoming that the United States relinquishes and retrocedes to the state of Wyoming any and all legislative jurisdiction heretofore acquired by the United States over lands within the Medicine Bow national forest constituting the area known as the Pole Mountain district, created as above stated, to take effect upon acceptance of such jurisdiction by the state of Wyoming.</p>

                  <p>The director is hereby authorized and empowered, subject to the approval of the state board of land commissioners, to effect and complete such exchange of state-owned lands for federal-owned lands; and also to effect and complete such exchange of state-owned lands for privately owned lands; and to do any and all things necessary or required to be done by the state of Wyoming in order to enable said state to comply with the provisions of said Taylor Grazing Act and other acts of congress authorizing the exchange of federal-owned lands, and any order, rule or regulation passed or promulgated in pursuance thereof; and to effect and complete the exchange of state-owned lands for privately-owned lands. The board of land commissioners may authorize the purchase of lands only in an amount necessary to effect and complete the exchange of state-owned lands for other lands and only for those lands identified in the authorization of purchase.

                  <p>(a) The board of land commissioners is hereby authorized and empowered to pass and promulgate all such orders, rules and regulations as may be necessary or required relative to the appraisal and valuation of the lands to be exchanged as provided in this act, and to provide for the execution of conveyances, contracts and other instruments pertaining to the exchange of the lands, and to enable the director to effect and complete each exchange of the lands. The board may authorize the purchase of lands only in an amount necessary to effect and complete the exchange of state-owned lands for other lands and only for those lands identified in the authorization of purchase. The board shall not use the power of eminent domain pursuant to W.S. 1-26-801 et seq. to purchase any lands under this section. The board of land commissioners is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement the exchange of state lands on a value for value basis. The exchange program may authorize a cash equalization receipt or payment of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the value of the lands exchanged. Any receipt shall be deposited into, and any payment shall be made from, the permanent land fund. State lands may be exchanged upon the board's finding the exchange is necessary to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Make state lands more manageable where the lands are not otherwise manageable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Meet a specific need of a school or community for land;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Better meet the multiple use objectives for the benefit of the trust; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Realize a clear long term benefit to the trust which substantially exceeds the present and probable future benefit from continued ownership.</p>

                  <p>The interstate compact for the prevention and control of forest fires as contained herein is hereby enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with any and all other states legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF FOREST FIRES</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I</p>
                  <p>Purpose</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the great plains region of the United States by the maintenance of adequate forest firefighting services by the member states, and providing for reciprocal aid in fighting forest fires among the compacting states of the region, including South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and any adjoining state of a current member.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE II</p>
                  <p>Operative Date</p>
                  <p>This compact is operative immediately as to those states ratifying it if any two (2) or more of the member states have ratified it.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE III</p>
                  <p>State Compact Administrator; Forest Fire Plan</p>
                  <p>(a) In each state, the state forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control may act as compact administrator for that state, consult with like officials of the other member states, and implement cooperation between the states in forest fire prevention and control. The compact administrators of the member states may organize to coordinate the services of the member states and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each member state may formulate and put in effect a forest fire plan for that state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IV</p>
                  <p>Aid to Other Member States</p>
                  <p>If the state forest fire control agency of a member state requests aid from the state forest fire control agency of another state in combating, controlling, or preventing forest fires, the state forest fire control agency of that state may render all possible aid to the requesting agency, consonant with the maintenance of protection at home.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V</p>
                  <p>Privileges; Liability; Claims and Reimbursement</p>
                  <p>(a) If the forces of any member state are rendering outside aid pursuant to the request of another member state under this compact, the employees of the state shall, under the directions of the officers of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the same powers (except the power of arrest), duties, rights, privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the state to which they are rendering aid.</p>
                  <p>(b) No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact is liable on account of any act or omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection with rendering outside aid.</p>

                  <p>(d) Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving the aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of, any equipment used in answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all materials, transportation, wages, salaries and maintenance of employees and equipment incurred in connection with the request. However, nothing in this compact prevents any assisting member state from assuming the loss, damage, expense, or other cost, from loaning the equipment, or from donating the services to the receiving member state without charge or cost.</p>
                  <p>(e) Each member state shall assure that workers compensation benefits in conformity with the minimum legal requirements of the state are available to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state pursuant to this compact.</p>
                  <p>(f) For the purposes of this compact, the term "employee" includes any volunteer or auxiliary legally included within the forest firefighting forces of the aiding state under the laws of the aiding state.</p>
                  <p>(g) The compact administrators may formulate procedures for claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article in accordance with the laws of the member state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>Effect of Compact on Existing Statutes; Duties</p>
                  <p>(a) Ratification of this compact does not affect any existing statute so as to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of the forest firefighting forces, equipment, services or facilities of any member state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Nothing in this compact authorizes or permits any member state to curtail or diminish its firefighting forces, equipment, services or facilities. Each member state shall maintain adequate forest firefighting forces and equipment to meet the demands for forest fire protection within its borders in the same manner and to the same extent as if the compact were not operative.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this compact limits or restricts the powers of any state ratifying the compact to provide for the prevention, control and extinguishment of forest fires, or to prohibit the enactment or enforcement of state laws, rules or regulations intended to aid in the prevention, control and extinguishment of forest fires in the state.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing in this compact affects any existing or future cooperative relationship or arrangement between the United States forest service and a member state or states.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VII</p>
                  <p>Representatives of the United States Forest Service Representatives of the United States forest service may attend meetings of the compact administrators.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
                  <p>Operation of Articles IV and V</p>
                  <p>The provisions of Articles IV and V of this compact that relate to reciprocal aid in combating, controlling or preventing forest fires are operative as between any state party to this compact and any other state which is party to this compact in another region if the legislature of the other state has given its assent to the mutual aid provisions of this compact.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IX</p>
                  <p>Withdrawal from Compact</p>
                  <p>This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each state ratifying it until the legislature or the governor of the state takes action to withdraw from the compact. Such action is not effective until six (6) months after notice of the withdrawal has been sent by the chief executive of the state desiring to withdraw to the chief executive of all states then party to the compact.</p>

                <p>(a) The state forester shall provide for the disposal of any slash resulting from the harvest of forest products and may require forest management work through a forest product sales contract or a service contract. The state forester may, when deemed necessary, require a slash deposit or performance bond to cover the anticipated cost of any slash disposal or required management work as a guarantee of compliance with contract specifications.</p>
                <p>(b) When any slash is not disposed of or management work is not completed in accordance with the requirements of the forest products sales contract or service contract, the state forester may go upon the premises with such personnel, equipment and supplies as may be necessary to burn or otherwise dispose of the slash or complete a required management project. The expense incurred in disposing of the slash or completing the required management project, shall be a charge against the posted performance bond or slash deposit.</p>
                <p>(c) Repealed By Laws 1999, ch. 124, § 2.</p>
                <p>(d) There is created the revolving forestry performance account in which any performance bond or slash deposit shall be deposited, and from which any expense incurred in the completion of slash disposal or another contract requirement not complying with forest products sale or service contract specifications shall be paid. The funds in the account are continuously appropriated to the state forester for the purposes of this section. Upon successful completion of required slash disposal or other contract requirements, as determined and approved by the state forester, the performance bond or slash deposit shall be refunded to the purchaser or contractor. If required slash disposal or other contract requirements are partially completed, the expense of completing the required work shall be charged against the forestry performance account with the balance of the performance bond or slash deposit, if any, refunded to the purchaser or contractor.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>36-6-101. Terms of leases; extensions; rules and regulations; rent and royalties; assignment of leases; grazing and agricultural leases; cooperation with United States or its lessees, in cooperative or unit plans.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The board of land commissioners may lease any state or state school lands for oil and gas for a primary term up to ten (10) years and as long thereafter as oil or gas may be produced in paying quantities, and may extend the term of existing oil and gas leases in good standing for as long as oil or gas may be produced in paying quantities.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board is further authorized to make and establish rules and regulations governing the issuance of oil and gas, coal and other mineral leases and covering the conduct of development and mining operations.</p>
                  <p>(c) Mineral leases may be issued upon such monthly or annual minimum rental payment basis as shall be fixed by the board, which payment shall be annually applied against such royalty as shall accrue for the same lease year by the terms of such lease, which royalty, as to lands leased for oil or gas shall not be less than five percent (5%) of all oil and gas produced and saved from and not used in operations on the lands under the lease, and royalty of not less than five cents ($.05) per ton on coal produced from the lands under any such lease for coal purposes, such royalty to be paid on mine run of coal. No mineral lease issued under the provisions of this section shall be assignable or transferable except with written consent of the director, subject to criteria established by the board, and he shall require the lessee's full compliance with and observance of all rules and regulations adopted by the board and for the lessee's compliance with all other terms of the lease. All mineral leases issued pursuant to this section shall be separate and distinct from each lease of the same land for grazing or agricultural purposes, issued by the board, and rules and regulations adopted by the board as herein authorized, shall provide for joint use of such lands for grazing and agricultural or mineral purposes without undue interference by the lessees under any such class of leases with lessees under any other such class.</p>
                  <p>(d) The director, subject to criteria established by the board, on behalf of the state, and its lessee or lessees in any such mineral lease are hereby further authorized to join, in the interest of conservation and greater ultimate recovery of oil and gas, in fair and equitable cooperative or unit plans of development or operation of oil and gas pools, with the United States government and its lessees, or permittees, or others, or any of them, and the director, subject to criteria established by the board, is hereby authorized to modify and change any and all terms and conditions of any such oil and gas lease or leases, heretofore or hereafter issued, as mutually agreed by the lessor and lessee in any such lease, as required to conform to the terms of any such lease to such cooperative or unit plan and as required to effectuate proper operations thereunder, which changes may include extension of the term of years otherwise applicable to any such lease, for the full period of time during which such cooperative or unit plan may remain in effect.</p>
                  <p>(e) When a cooperative or unit agreement is terminated or ceases to be effective as to lands upon which there is no production of oil or gas, the lease covering such lands shall remain in effect for a period of two (2) years from the date such lands ceased to be subject to said agreement, or for the remaining length of the term of the original lease, whichever shall be the greater, and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from said lands in accordance with the requirements of the original lease.</p>
                  <p>(f) The terms of any lease issued under this section for land on which actual drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of its primary term and are being diligently prosecuted at that time shall be extended for one (1) year and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.</p>
                  <p>(g) All natural gas leases executed hereunder shall provide that the state of Wyoming may require the lessee to dedicate all the natural gas produced on lands owned by the state for the use or benefit of the people of the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(h) If the state board of land commissioners determines it would benefit the people of the state to have the natural gas dedicated, the board may arrange for the sale of the natural gas for the use of the people of the state or arrange for the exchange of the natural gas produced with producers of natural gas produced from lands not owned by the state if the exchange will benefit the people of the state. If the board determines the dedication would not be in the public interest; or would cause waste as defined by W.S. 30-5-101; or would unreasonably deny the lessee the opportunity to economically market the natural gas, it may waive dedication.</p>
                  <p>(j) The board shall adopt and promulgate necessary rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of subsections (g), (h) and (j) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) The board, on behalf of the state, and its lessee or lessees in coal and other mineral leases, may approve cooperative mining development plans established for the purpose of development of the mineral resources in an efficient and economical manner and in accordance with sound engineering practice. The board may also modify and change any and all terms and conditions of any coal and other mineral lease or leases, heretofore or hereafter issued, as mutually agreed by the lessor and lessee in the lease. The director, subject to criteria established by the board, may conform the terms of the lease to a cooperative mining development plan required to effectuate proper operations, with changes that may include extension of the term of years otherwise applicable to the lease, for the full period of time during which the cooperative mining development plan may remain in effect. A cooperative development plan may consist of one (1) or more private, state or federal leaseholds or mineral interests. All lands in a cooperative mining development plan shall be under the effective control of a single operator, capable of being developed and operated as a single operation.</p>
                  <p>(m) The director, subject to criteria established by the board, may lease any state or state school lands for coal and other mineral purposes for a primary term of not exceeding ten (10) years. Lessee shall have the exclusive right to renew the lease for successive terms of ten (10) years each, if at the time application for renewal is filed:</p>
                  <p>(i) Coal or other minerals covered by the lease are actually being produced from the leased lands and the lessee is complying with all lease terms; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The leased lands are committed to a cooperative mining development plan approved by the board and coal or other minerals are actually being produced from the cooperative mining development plan and the lessee is complying with the plan and all lease terms; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The lessee is proceeding in good faith to develop the leased lands; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) If the lessee shows to the satisfaction of the director or the board that production of coal or other minerals has been delayed by the necessity of obtaining licenses, permits, or other approvals from governmental authorities and that the lessee has used reasonable diligence in an effort to obtain the licenses, permits or other required authorizations.</p>
                  <p>(n) As used in subsection (m) of this section, good faith development means the substantial expenditures or firm commitments for exploration, engineering, environmental studies, hydrological studies or research and development which is required for development of the lease. To assist the lessee in planning for the orderly development of the lease or leases, the lessee may submit to the board at any time during the term of the lease or leases a schedule and discussion of proposed expenditures or commitments for the development of the lease or leases. After reviewing the schedule and discussion, the board shall issue a ruling in writing within ninety (90) days binding upon the state and the lessee, determining whether or not the proposed expenditures or commitments, when and if actually made by lessee, shall qualify as "substantial expenditures or commitments" so as to constitute "good faith development" within the meaning of subsection (m) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(o) Any mineral lessee or producer shall report all production including total volume, value and disposition of the mineral production under any lease, unit or communitization agreement in a timely manner and in such form as determined by the board. Any person failing to comply with this subsection shall be subject to penalties enacted by the board or the cancellation of the lease or agreement under which they are operating.</p>

                  <p>(a) Contingent upon the leasing of any state or state school lands for coal, uranium or other mineral exploration, the board of land commissioners shall require copies of all electrical, gamma-ray neutron, resistivity or other types of subsurface log reports, and all assay reports for any rock cores or cuttings to be submitted to the office of the state geologist within ninety (90) days after completion of drilling and completion of associated reports. Reports submitted to the oil and gas conservation commission are deemed to satisfy the requirements of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) All subsurface log reports and assay reports will be held confidential for a period of three (3) years after initial receipt by the state geologist. Confidentiality may be extended in one (1) year increments upon receipt by the state geologist of a written request by certified mail, return receipt requested, from the person or legal entity requesting that confidentiality be extended. All requests must be received prior to the expiration of the period of confidentiality. All reports filed under this section shall become the property of the state to be retained within the permanent files of the Wyoming geological survey board for the use of the office and public after the period of confidentiality has expired.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this article:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Associated natural resource" means any substance, element or compound, either gaseous, liquid or solid, associated with the production, refining or processing of oil or gas. The term includes, but is not limited to, propane, butanes, ethane, methane, carbon dioxide, sulphur, helium, nitrogen and natural gas liquids;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Natural gas" means hydrocarbons or nonhydrocarbons which at atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure are in a gaseous phase;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Oil" means crude petroleum and other hydrocarbons regardless of gravity which are produced at the wellhead in liquid form, and the liquid hydrocarbons known as distillate or condensate recovered or extracted from gas, other than gas produced in association with oil and commonly known as casinghead gas;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Processing plant" means a plant to remove liquefiable hydrocarbons from a gas stream or to separate natural gas into physically or chemically distinct marketable associated natural resources;</p>
                  <p>(v) "Return on investment" means a percentage rate applied over a period of years to the equity investment for construction of transportation facilities or processing plants for oil, natural gas or associated natural resources. This percentage rate represents the rate a lessee or successor in interest supposedly could have received from investment of equity in some other commercial or financial undertaking. "Return on investment" also means a percentage of earnings or profitability ratio which a lessee, producer or successor in interest anticipates or desires to receive on the equity investment in transportation facilities or processing plant;</p>
                  <p>(vi) "Transportation facilities" means those facilities constructed for moving any oil, natural gas or associated natural resource from the place of production to the closest point of sale or to a processing plant.</p>

                  <p>Companies, associations, or corporations operating or controlling irrigation systems, ditches, or reservoirs or other devices for the distribution of water for irrigation shall be authorized to levy and collect such reasonable and necessary assessments for the cost of operation, maintenance, repairs and improvements of such irrigation systems, ditches or reservoirs, and for the purpose of repaying money borrowed for such purposes, as may be authorized by a majority of the members of such companies, or associations, or fixed in the manner provided by the bylaws of such corporation. Payment of such assessments shall be the necessary requisite for the use of such reservoirs, irrigation systems or ditches for the storage or conveyance of water for the lands deeded or described in contracts for or deeds to proportionate interests in such reservoirs, irrigation systems and ditches upon which assessments are made, and in the event such assessments remain due and unpaid more than ten (10) days after the date fixed as the date of payment for the purpose, such companies, associations and corporations are authorized to close down any headgate or other diverting or measuring device used by any delinquent, or by any person in possession of or using such lands, and to refuse to allow the use of such reservoirs, irrigation systems and ditches for the purpose of storing water for or conveying water to the lands of such delinquents and refuse such delinquents the right to vote at any meeting of such company, association, or corporation, until such repair or maintenance assessment shall have been paid. Such companies, associations and corporations shall have a lien upon the proportionate interest in such reservoirs, irrigation systems and ditches, which shall become a first lien upon the lands deeded or described in contracts for or deeds to such proportionate interests for the amount of any unpaid assessments which may be enforced in a court of competent jurisdiction, as in the case of other liens. In all suits or actions to obtain a judgment on such account and to enforce the lien, when the plaintiff or complainant shall obtain judgment or decree, the costs, together with twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for attorney's fees, shall be taxed or recovered from the adverse party. No restraining order, or order of injunction shall be issued against any such company, association or corporation unless applicant for same shall file a sufficient bond conditioned upon the immediate payment of all delinquent assessments if such shall be found by a competent court to be reasonable and just. This act [section] shall include all lands under any of the above named systems if water has been used or is being used in any one irrigation season and providing that water is in said canal, reservoir or ditches, subject to use of owners.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created an agency and instrumentality of the state to be known as the "Wyoming Yellowstone Park commission" and by that name the commission may sue and be sued and plead and be impleaded. The exercise by the commission of the powers conferred by this act [ § § 36-8-201 through 36-8-238] is an essential governmental function of the state. However, the performance of such governmental functions shall not be construed to relieve the commission from liability for personal injuries or property damages incurred by it through its negligence or the negligence of its servants or agents.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission shall consist of five (5) members appointed by the governor, by and with the consent of the senate. The members shall be residents of the state and qualified electors therein for a period of at least one (1) year next preceding their appointment. The successor of each member shall be appointed for a term of five (5) years, except that any person appointed to fill a vacancy shall be appointed in accordance with W.S. 28-12-101. Members are eligible for reappointment. The governor may remove members of the commission as provided in W.S. 9-1-202.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall elect one (1) of the members as chairman, another as vice-chairman and another as secretary and treasurer.

                  <p>(a) The commission shall be empowered and is hereby authorized from time to time to issue its negotiable bonds for any of its public purposes, including the payment of the cost of the project and incidental expenses in connection therewith, and to secure the payment of the same by a lien or pledge covering all or part of its contracts or revenues.

In case any officer whose signature or facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the commission may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The commission may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the commission.</p>
                  <p>(b) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the commission may under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The commission may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.</p>

                  <p>(i) Pledging all or any part of the moneys, earnings, income and revenues derived from the project of the commission to secure the payment of the bonds or of any issue of the bonds subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then exist;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The rates, rentals, admission fees and other charges to be fixed and collected and the amounts to be raised in each year thereby, and the use and disposition of the earnings and other revenues;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The setting aside of reserves and the creation of sinking funds and the regulation and disposition thereof;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Limitations on the right of the commission to restrict and regulate the use of the project;</p>
                  <p>(v) Limitations in the purposes to which and the manner in which the proceeds of sale of any issue of bonds may be applied;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Limitations on the issuance of additional bonds, the terms upon which additional bonds may be issued and secured; the refunding of outstanding or other bonds;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The creation of special funds into which any earnings or revenues of the commission may be deposited;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The terms and provisions of any trust indenture securing the bonds or under which bonds may be issued;</p>
                  <p>(x) Vesting in a trustee or trustees such properties, rights, powers and duties in trust as the commission may determine;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Defining the acts or omissions to act which shall constitute a default in the obligations and duties of the commission to the bondholders and providing the rights and remedies of the bondholders in the event of such default, including as a matter of right the appointment of a receiver, provided, however, that such rights and remedies shall not be inconsistent with the general laws of this state and other provisions of this act;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Limitations on the power of the commission to sell or otherwise dispose of the project, or any part thereof;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Any other matters, of like or different character which in any way affect the security or protection of the bonds;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) Limitations on the amount of moneys derived from the project to be expended for operating, administrative or other expenses of the commission;</p>
                  <p>(xv) The protection and enforcement of the rights and remedies of the bondholders;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) The obligations of the commission in relation to the acquisition, leasing, licensing, construction, maintenance, operation, repairs and insurance of the project, the safeguarding and application, of all moneys and as to the requirements for the supervision, managements, and approval of consulting engineers and others in connection with construction, reconstruction and operation;</p>
                  <p>(xvii) The payment of the proceeds of bonds and revenues of the project to a trustee or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof with such safeguards and restrictions as the commission may determine.</p>
                  <p>(d) It is the intention of the legislature that any pledge of earnings, revenues or other moneys made by the commission shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; that the earnings, revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the commission shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and that the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the commission irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.</p>
                  <p>(e) Neither the members of the commission nor any person executing the bonds or other obligations shall be liable personally on the bonds or other obligations or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, any resolution or resolutions authorizing bonds of the commission shall contain a covenant by the commission that it will at all times maintain rates, admission fees, rentals, and other charges sufficient to pay the cost of operation and maintenance of the project, the principal of and interest on any bonds issued pursuant to such resolution or resolutions as the same severally become due and payable, and to maintain any reserves or other funds required by the terms of such resolution or resolutions.</p>

                  <p>In the discretion of the commission any bonds issued under the provisions of this act may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the commission and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Any such trust agreement may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof. Any such trust agreement or any resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the commission in relation to the acquisition, leasing or licensing of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the project, the rates, admission fees, charges and rentals to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and provision for the employment of managers, and consulting engineers in connection with the construction or operation of the project. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the commission. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of trusts, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds or debentures of corporations.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement may contain such other provisions as the commission may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the project.</p>

                  <p>(b) The department of state parks and cultural resources shall administer this area providing for the best possible state historic site, and it shall be the responsibility of the department to provide all reasonable and necessary safety facilities made necessary by reason of the increased hazards resulting from the establishing of a state park adjacent to, and on both sides of, Union Pacific Railroad Company's main line right-of-way and tracks. These safety facilities shall include, but are not limited to, such fencing of Union Pacific Railroad Company's main line right-of-way as is reasonably necessary to prevent access by the general public to such right-of-way; some type of pedestrian walkway through the grade separation to provide pedestrian access between the south and north sides of the site; and either the closing of the Fort Steele grade crossing to the general public or the establishment at said crossing of grade crossing protection devices consisting of flasher lights and gates. The department is hereby authorized to enter into agreements with Union Pacific Railroad Company relative to the department's providing such reasonable and necessary safety facilities. In the event the department and Union Pacific Railroad Company are unable to so agree, the public service commission of Wyoming shall determine what reasonable and necessary safety facilities shall be provided by the department at Fort Fred Steele state historic site, upon application filed with the public service commission of Wyoming by either Union Pacific Railroad Company or the department. These necessary and reasonable safety facilities shall be constructed before the opening of the Fort Fred Steele state historic site to the public.</p>

After receiving the findings of the hearing and the report under this subsection, the governor may authorize the execution of the lease or use agreement negotiated under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the governor determines that it is in the best interests of the state to take ownership of the Quebec 1 missile alert facility, the governor is authorized to negotiate the terms of the transfer. Negotiations shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of whether the state may acquire by way of donation equipment and accessories from the United States department of the air force used when the Quebec 1 missile alert facility was in full operation or used in other related or nonrelated military operations to enhance the experience of the historic site, including retired missile shells and retired military aircraft, vehicles and arms. A transfer under this subsection shall be in accordance with the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Prior to any transfer, the department of state parks and cultural resources shall hold a public hearing to receive input on how operating the facility as a historic site may affect adjacent landowners and on the advisability of proceeding with the transfer. Upon completion of the hearing, the department of state parks and cultural resources shall report the findings of the hearing to the governor;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The legislature authorizes the governor to accept the terms of the transfer provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The governor considers the findings reported under paragraph (i) of this subsection and determines it is in the best interests of the state to take ownership of the facility;</p>
                  <p>(B) The governor reports the terms of the transfer to the joint appropriations committee prior to the transfer;</p>
                  <p>(C) The terms of the transfer include a provision requiring the United States department of the air force or other appropriate agency to retain liability for all environmental, closure and reclamation obligations that exist as of the date of the potential transfer.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon transfer of land, the Quebec 1 missile alert facility is declared to be a state historic site and shall be known as the "Quebec 1 missile alert facility state historic site".</p>

                <p>(a) The board of land commissioners may at any time direct the sale of state lands subject to any lease thereof. Subject to criteria established by the board, any person may request that a parcel of state land be considered for sale by the board, but such lands shall only be nominated for sale by a majority vote of the board. Such lands which have been reserved in any way to the public use, or for the use of public institutions, shall not be sold to any member of the board. The board shall sell such lands according to the subdivisions of sections as established by the United States survey thereof, or by metes and bounds, as may appear to be to the interest of the state of Wyoming. The board shall sell such subdivisions as it shall deem for the best interests of the state land trust. The board shall not sell state land unless the board finds that the proceeds from the sale are protected from inflationary effects and the proceeds will earn a significantly higher rate of return than can be realized through retention of the surface estate and if the board finds that the sale will:</p>
                <p>(i) Make state lands more manageable where the lands are not otherwise manageable;</p>
                <p>(ii) Meet a specific need of a school or community for land;</p>
                <p>(iii) Better meet multiple use objectives of the beneficiaries of the trust; or</p>
                <p>(iv) Realize a clear long term benefit to the trust which substantially exceeds the present and probable future benefit from continued ownership.</p>

                <p>(ii) The attempted imposition upon the state of Wyoming by the congress of the United States of a requirement in the Statehood Act that the state of Wyoming and its people "disclaim all right and title to any lands or other property not granted or confirmed to the state or its political subdivisions by or under the authority of this act, the right or title to which is held by the United States or is subject to disposition by the United States", as a condition precedent to acceptance of Wyoming into the Union, was an act beyond the power of the congress of the United States and is thus void;</p>
                <p>(iii) The purported right of ownership and control of the unappropriated public land in the state of Wyoming by the United States is without foundation and violates the clear intent of the constitution of the United States; and</p>
                <p>(iv) The exercise of that dominion and control of the public land in the state of Wyoming by the United States works a severe, continuous and debilitating hardship upon the people of the state of Wyoming.</p>
