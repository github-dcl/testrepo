                  <p>(b) Any information pertaining to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, referral or treatment of any licensee possessed in connection with the performance of any professional assistance program shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except under the circumstances expressly authorized by subsections (c) and (d) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(j) Nothing in subsection (c) of this section shall be construed to prohibit public accountants from providing the services listed in subsection (c) of this section as long as the public accountant does not hold himself out to be a certified public accountant.</p>

                  <p>(ii) The foreign designation:</p>
                  <p>(A) Was issued by a foreign authority that regulates the practice of certified public accountancy and the foreign designation has not expired or been revoked or suspended;</p>
                  <p>(B) Entitles the holder to issue reports upon financial statements; and</p>

                <p>(b) Before issuing any license under this act to any circus or carnival specified under subsection (a) of this section, the board of county commissioners for any county and the governing body of any city or town may require and provide for the inspection of the safety of the applicant's facilities, equipment, rides or other structures which are for public use. Public use of any facility, equipment, ride or other structure determined unsafe following inspection is prohibited until the unsafe condition is corrected, repaired or otherwise modified. Failure of the applicant to make necessary corrections, repairs or modifications pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for disapproval of the license application under this act.</p>

                <p>(d) The issuance of a license pursuant to this act shall not relieve any licensee from acting with reasonable care in the operation or maintenance of a circus or carnival. The licensing authority as a condition of issuing a license under this section, shall require a licensee to provide proof of liability insurance coverage of a minimum amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) at the time of issuing the license and to indemnify, defend and save harmless the city, town or county from any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action arising from the negligent acts or omission of the carnival or circus.

Within thirty (30) days from the date of notification the licensee shall file a new bond with the board. If a licensee fails to file a new bond satisfactory to the board within the time allowed, the right of the licensee to conduct a collection agency shall terminate.</p>

                  <p>(a) It is unlawful for any person or entity to operate a crematory disposing of human remains without the crematory being first granted a permit by the board as a crematory, or to chemically dispose of human remains in a chemical disposition facility, unless the chemical disposition facility is first granted a permit by the board to operate as a chemical disposition facility.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board shall examine the premises and structure of any crematory or chemical disposition facility and shall issue the permit only if the applicant and the structure meet the standards required by rules and regulations of the board and the provisions of this act.</p>
                  <p>(c) Every person desiring to operate a crematory or chemically dispose of human remains within the state of Wyoming shall apply to the board for a crematory permit or a chemical disposition facility permit, upon a form and in the manner prescribed by the board, accompanied by the appropriate fee and satisfactory evidence of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The applicant, unless an organization, shall be a licensed funeral service practitioner or funeral director who is a shareholder or officer in or is directly employed by a licensed funeral establishment. The applicant, when an organization, shall be a funeral establishment permitted by the board that employs at least one (1) licensed funeral service practitioner assigned as the funeral service licensee responsible for the crematory or chemical disposition facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The application shall designate a licensed funeral service practitioner as the funeral service practitioner responsible for the crematory or chemical disposition facility; and</p>

                  <p>(iv) An employee who is not a licensed funeral service practitioner may assist in the operation of a crematory or chemical disposition facility to the extent directed by a funeral service practitioner following the facility's receipt of human remains in a closed cremation container. An employee who is not a funeral service practitioner shall not handle human remains or open a closed cremation container.

The funeral service practitioner overseeing the facility shall successfully complete a crematory or chemical disposition facility operator's certification program approved by the board. The supervising funeral service practitioner shall ensure that employees who are operating crematories under the direction of a funeral service practitioner or funeral director successfully complete a crematory or chemical disposition operator's certification program approved by the board. The board may waive or extend the time to complete the certification program required by this section due to hardship or difficulty in completing the required certification program.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the applicant proposes to operate more than one (1) crematory or chemical disposition facility, the applicant shall make a separate application and procure a separate license for each separate location.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any crematory or chemical disposer licensee desiring to change the location of the business shall make application to the board at least thirty (30) days prior to the time that the change in location is to take effect. A fee as established by the board shall accompany the application for the change. The board shall grant the change provided the location conforms to the provisions of this act.</p>

A fee as established by the board shall accompany the application for the change.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any crematory or chemical disposition facility desiring to change the licensed funeral service practitioner responsible for the crematory or chemical disposition facility shall make application to the board immediately.

                  <p>A proceeding for discipline of a licensee, certificate holder or a temporary permit holder, or action against an applicant for a license, certificate or temporary permit, may be commenced when the board has reasonable grounds to believe that a person under the board's jurisdiction has committed acts in violation of W.S. 33-21-146. No license or certificate to practice nursing or nurse assisting may be revoked or denied by the board without affording the licensee, certificate holder or applicant due process of law. However, the board may summarily suspend a license or certificate and institute proceedings concomitantly if the board finds that the licensee or certificate holder presents a clear and immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare if allowed to continue to practice. For purposes of a suspension or other restriction imposed pursuant to W.S. 33-21-146(b), the board may presume that the court imposing the suspension or restriction afforded the licensee, certificate holder or applicant due process of law.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>33-21-157. Nurses volunteer license.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) As used in this section, "low income uninsured person" and "nonprofit health care facility" have the same meanings as in W.S. 33-15-131(a).</p>
                  <p>(b) For purposes of this section, a person shall be considered retired from the practice of practical, professional or advanced practice registered nursing if the person's license has expired.</p>
                  <p>(c) The state board of nursing may issue, with or without examination, a volunteer's license to a person who is retired from practice so that the person may provide nursing services to low income uninsured persons at nonprofit health care facilities. The board shall deny issuance of a volunteer's license to a person who is not qualified under this section to hold a volunteer's license.</p>
                  <p>(d) An application for a volunteer's license shall include all of the following:</p>

                  <p>(A) The applicant has maintained for at least ten (10) years immediately prior to retirement full licensure in good standing in any jurisdiction in the United States that licenses persons to practice nursing; or</p>

                  <p>(iv) A notarized statement from the applicant, on a form prescribed by the board, that the applicant:</p>
                  <p>(A) Will not accept any form of remuneration for any nursing services rendered while in possession of a volunteer's license;</p>
                  <p>(B) Will devote his nursing practice exclusively and totally to providing nursing services to low income uninsured persons at a nonprofit health care facility in this state; and</p>

The board shall not renew a license if the holder has not complied with the continuing education requirements. The nonprofit health care facility in which the holder provides nursing services may pay for or reimburse the holder for any costs incurred in obtaining the required continuing education.</p>
                  <p>(h) The board shall issue to each person who qualifies under this section a volunteer's license that states the license holder is authorized to provide nursing services pursuant to the laws of this state.</p>
                  <p>(j) Except as provided in this section, any person holding a volunteer's license issued by the board under this section shall be subject to the requirements of this act and the jurisdiction of the board as if he were licensed to practice nursing under this act.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>33-21-202. Compact approved and ratified.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The Nurse Licensure Compact is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with all other states legally joining in the compact in a form substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I</p>
                  <p>Findings and Declaration of Purpose</p>
                  <p>(a) The party states find that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;</p>
                  <p>(v) The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.</p>
                  <p>(b) The general purposes of this compact are to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation and adverse actions;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(v) Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE II</p>
                  <p>Definitions</p>

                  <p>(iv) "Current significant investigative information" means:</p>
                  <p>(A) Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.</p>
                  <p>(v) "Encumbrance" means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board;</p>

                  <p>ARTICLE III</p>
                  <p>General Provisions and Jurisdiction</p>
                  <p>(a) A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse (RN) or as a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN), under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state.</p>
                  <p>(b) A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. The procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the federal bureau of investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.</p>
                  <p>(c) Each party state shall require the following for an applicant to obtain or retain a multistate license in the home state:</p>
                  <p>(i) Meets the home state's qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, as well as, all other applicable state laws;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has graduated or is eligible to graduate from a licensing board approved RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program or has graduated from a foreign RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program that:</p>

                  <p>(xi) Has a valid United States social security number.</p>
                  <p>(d) All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with existing state due process law, to take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation or any other action that affects a nurse's authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.</p>
                  <p>(e) A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.</p>
                  <p>(f) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single state license.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse's then current home state, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this compact's effective date, must meet all applicable Article III(c) requirements to obtain a multistate license from a new home state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in Article III(c) due to a disqualifying event occurring after this compact's effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators ("Commission").</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IV</p>
                  <p>Applications for Licensure in a Party State</p>
                  <p>(a) Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.</p>
                  <p>(b) A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one (1) party state at a time.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two (2) party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the commission. Further:</p>
                  <p>(i) The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single state license, valid only in the former home state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V</p>
                  <p>Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards</p>
                  <p>(a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state;</p>
                  <p>(B) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;</p>
                  <p>(v) Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.</p>
                  <p>(b) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.

Failure to provide service of process in any proceeding to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or promulgated rules.</p>
                  <p>(b) Default, technical assistance and termination shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:</p>

                  <p>(ii) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination;</p>

                  <p>(vi) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

                  <p>(i) Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and nonparty states;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:</p>
                  <p>(A) The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute;</p>
                  <p>(B) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.</p>
                  <p>(d) Enforcement of the compact shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact;</p>

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The remedies provided in this subsection shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>

                  <p>Effective Date, Withdrawal and Amendment</p>
                  <p>(a) This compact shall become effective and binding on the earlier of the date of legislative enactment of this compact into law by no less than twenty-six (26) states or December 31, 2018.

                  <p>(b) Each party state to this compact shall continue to recognize a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in that party state issued under the prior compact until such party state has withdrawn from the prior compact.</p>

                  <p>(f) This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.</p>

                  <p>The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with all other states legally joining in the compact in a form substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I</p>
                  <p>Findings and Declaration of Purpose</p>
                  <p>(a) The party states find that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) licensure requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state APRN licensure laws;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state APRN licensure laws difficult and complex;</p>
                  <p>(v) The current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both APRNs and states;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.</p>
                  <p>(b) The general purposes of this compact are to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation, including promotion of uniform licensure requirements;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of APRN regulation, investigation and adverse actions;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in each jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(v) Invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of APRN licenses; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Provide opportunities for interstate practice by APRNs who meet uniform licensure requirements.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE II</p>
                  <p>Definitions</p>

                  <p>(A) Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the APRN to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Investigative information that indicates that the APRN represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the APRN has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.</p>
                  <p>(viii) "Encumbrance" means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board;</p>
                  <p>(ix) "Home state" means the party state that is the APRN's primary state of residence;</p>
                  <p>(x) "Licensing board" means a party state's regulatory body responsible for regulating the practice of advanced practice registered nursing;</p>
                  <p>(xi) "Multistate license" means an APRN license to practice as an APRN issued by a home state licensing board that authorizes the APRN to practice as an APRN in all party states under a multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state;</p>
                  <p>(xii) "Multistate licensure privilege" means a legal authorization associated with an APRN multistate license that permits an APRN to practice as an APRN in a remote state, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) "Noncontrolled prescription drug" means a device or drug that is not a controlled substance and is prohibited under state or federal law from being dispensed without a prescription. The term includes a device or drug that bears or is required to bear the legend "caution: federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription" or "prescription only" or other legend that complies with federal law;</p>

                  <p>(xx) "State practice laws" means a party state's laws, rules and regulations that govern APRN practice, define the scope of advanced nursing practice, including prescriptive authority, and create the methods and grounds for imposing discipline. State practice laws do not include the requirements necessary to obtain and retain an APRN license, except for qualifications or requirements of the home state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE III</p>
                  <p>General Provisions and Jurisdiction</p>
                  <p>(a) A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial APRN licensure or APRN licensure by endorsement. The procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric based information by APRN applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the federal bureau of investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.</p>
                  <p>(b) By rule, the commission shall adopt the APRN uniform licensure requirements. The uniform licensure requirements shall provide the minimum requirements for APRN multistate licensure in party states, provided that the commission may adopt rules whereby an APRN, with an unencumbered license on the effective date of this compact, may obtain, by endorsement or otherwise, and retain a multistate license in a party state.</p>
                  <p>(c) In order to obtain or retain a multistate license, an APRN must meet, in addition to the uniform licensure requirements, the home state's qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, as well as, all other applicable home state laws.</p>
                  <p>(d) By rule, the commission shall identify the approved APRN roles and population foci for licensure as an APRN. An APRN issued a multistate license shall be licensed in an approved APRN role and at least one (1) approved population focus.</p>
                  <p>(e) An APRN multistate license issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing the APRN to practice as an APRN in each party state, under a multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state. If an applicant does not qualify for a multistate license, a single state license may be issued by a home state.</p>
                  <p>(f) Issuance of an APRN multistate license shall include prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs, unless the APRN was licensed by the home state prior to the home state's adoption of this compact and has not previously held prescriptive authority. Further:</p>
                  <p>(i) An APRN granted prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs in the home state may exercise prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs in any remote state while exercising a multistate licensure privilege under an APRN multistate license. The APRN shall not be required to meet any additional eligibility requirements imposed by the remote state in exercising prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Prescriptive authority in the home state for an APRN who was not granted prescriptive authority at the time of initial licensure by the home state, prior to the adoption of this compact, shall be determined under home state law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Prescriptive authority eligibility for an APRN holding a single state license shall be determined under the law of the licensing state.</p>
                  <p>(g) For each state in which an APRN seeks authority to prescribe controlled substances, the APRN shall satisfy all requirements imposed by the state in granting or renewing such authority.</p>
                  <p>(h) An APRN issued a multistate license is authorized to assume responsibility and accountability for patient care independent of a supervisory or collaborative relationship with a physician. This authority may be exercised in the home state and in any remote state in which the APRN exercises a multistate licensure privilege. For an APRN issued a single state license in a party state, the requirement for a supervisory or collaborative relationship with a physician shall be determined under applicable party state law.</p>
                  <p>(j) All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with state due process laws, to take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation or any other action that affects an APRN's authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes any action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any actions by remote states.</p>
                  <p>(k) An APRN practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. APRN practice is not limited to patient care, but shall include all advanced nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. APRN practice in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject the APRN to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.</p>
                  <p>(m) This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as satisfying any state law requirement for registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice as an APRN in that state.</p>
                  <p>(n) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single state APRN license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as an APRN in any other party state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IV</p>
                  <p>Applications for APRN Licensure in a Party State</p>
                  <p>(a) Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered nursing license or an advanced practice registered nurse license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.</p>
                  <p>(b) An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the home state, in only one (1) party state at a time.</p>
                  <p>(c) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving between two (2) party states, the APRN must apply for APRN licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state shall be deactivated in accordance with applicable commission rules and the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A multistate APRN license shall not be issued by the new home state until the APRN provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home state.</p>
                  <p>(d) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the APRN multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single state license, valid only in the former home state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V</p>
                  <p>Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards</p>
                  <p>(a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Only the home state shall have power to take adverse action against an APRN's license issued by the home state;</p>
                  <p>(B) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct that occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an APRN's authority to practice within that party state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court's practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;</p>
                  <p>(v) Obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant, fingerprints or other biometric based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decisions;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected APRN the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that APRN; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.</p>
                  <p>(b) If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN's multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states under a multistate licensure privilege shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the APRN's multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an APRN's multistate license shall include a statement that the APRN's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the duration of the APRN's participation in an alternative program.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information</p>
                  <p>(a) All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all APRNs, licensed registered nurses and licensed practical/vocational nurses. This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each APRN, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordinated administration of APRN licensure and enforcement efforts.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of information under this compact.</p>
                  <p>(c) All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications, including the reasons for such denials, and APRN participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether the participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.</p>
                  <p>(d) Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing the information shall be removed from the coordinated licensure information system.</p>
                  <p>(h) The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:</p>
                  <p>(i) Identifying information;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Licensure data;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Information related to alternative program participation information; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by commission rules.</p>
                  <p>(j) The compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents and information requested by another party state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VII</p>
                  <p>Establishment of the Interstate Commission of APRN Compact Administrators</p>
                  <p>(a) The party states hereby create and establish a joint public agency known as the Interstate Commission of APRN Compact Administrators, in accordance with the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The commission is an instrumentality of the party states;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>

                  <p>(i) Each party state shall have and be limited to one (1) administrator. The head of the state licensing board or designee shall be the administrator of this compact for each party state. Any administrator may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state from which the administrator is appointed. Any vacancy occurring in the commission shall be filled in accordance with the laws of the party state in which the vacancy exists;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Each administrator shall be entitled to one (1) vote with regard to the promulgation of rules and creation of bylaws and shall otherwise have an opportunity to participate in the business and affairs of the commission. An administrator shall vote in person or by such other means as provided in the bylaws. The bylaws may provide for an administrator's participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the bylaws or rules of the commission;</p>

                  <p>(iii) Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board, the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states;</p>

                  <p>(i) Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and nonparty states;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:</p>
                  <p>(A) The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute;</p>
                  <p>(B) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.</p>
                  <p>(d) Enforcement of the compact shall be as follows:</p>

In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The remedies provided in this subsection shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE X</p>
                  <p>Effective Date, Withdrawal and Amendment</p>
                  <p>(a) This compact shall come into limited effect at the time the compact has been enacted into law in ten (10) party states for the sole purpose of establishing and convening the commission to adopt rules relating to its operation and the APRN uniform licensure requirements.</p>

                <p>(b) The practice of optometry is the employment of any means other than the use of therapeutic lasers or surgery for diagnosing and treating ocular pathology and for the measurement of the powers or range of human vision or the determination of the accommodative and refractive status of the human eye or the scope of its functions in general or the adaptation of lenses or frames for the aid thereof.</p>
                <p>(c) The provisions of this chapter do not prevent a physician from treating or fitting glasses to the human eye, or a physician or optometrist from filling prescriptions or orders. Nor do the provisions of this chapter prevent the replacing, duplicating or repairing of ophthalmic lenses or the frames or fittings thereof by persons qualified to write or fill prescriptions or orders under the provisions of this act, nor prevent the doing of the merely mechanical work upon such lenses or upon the frames or fittings thereof.</p>

                <p>(e) The provisions of this chapter do not prohibit the sale of goggles, sunglasses, colored glasses or occupational eye-protective devices if they do not have refractive values, nor do the provisions of this act prohibit the sale of complete ready-to-wear eyeglasses as merchandise by any person not holding himself out as competent to examine, test or prescribe for the human eye or its refractive errors.</p>
                <p>(f) Nothing in this act shall prevent an optometrist from using assistants in his practice under his general supervision as defined in board rule.</p>

                <p>(a) Any applicant for licensure under this act is required to pass the examination series administered by the National Board of Examiners in Optometry, or its successor agency, and any other examination specified by the board in rule. The applicant shall be a graduate of an optometric school or college accredited by a regional or professional accreditation organization which is recognized or approved by the council on postsecondary accreditation or the United States Department of Education (USDE) or the Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), or their successor agencies. Examinations shall cover subjects designated by the board. Any currently licensed person intending to employ diagnostic or therapeutic pharmaceutical agents in his practice is required to complete and pass a board approved course pertaining to the use of those agents.</p>
                <p>(b) No applicant shall be passed by the board who fails to obtain a grade of seventy-five percent (75%) in every subject upon which he is examined. If any applicant fails to pass any examination, he shall be examined at the next or any succeeding examination only in the subject in which he failed to obtain a grade of eighty-five percent (85%). The applicant shall apply for his license within six (6) months after he has satisfactorily passed the examination or the examination shall be of no effect. Before engaging in the practice of optometry, and after the license has been delivered to him, each licensed optometrist shall notify the board in writing of the place where he intends to begin practice and of any subsequent changes of his office location. Notices given to him by the board shall be given by mailing to that address.</p>
                <p>(c) In addition to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an applicant for licensure under this act shall provide the board fingerprints and other information necessary for a criminal history record background check as provided under W.S. 7-19-201.</p>
                <p>(d) The board of examiners, pursuant to W.S. 33-1-201, shall establish fees for the standard examination, initial license and the annual renewal of the license. Every optometrist who desires to continue the practice of optometry shall annually, on or before April 1, pay the board the required renewal fee. A license which has expired due to failure to renew may be reinstated by the board upon receipt of the renewal fee and reinstatement and late fees set by the board in accordance with W.S. 33-1-201 provided the request for reinstatement is received in the board office no later than June 30 of the year in which the license expired. An optometrist who previously notified the board that he had retired may renew his license by submitting renewal fees for each year in which no license was issued and a reinstatement fee within three (3) years of the expiration date of the last license held. Upon retirement from active practice, an optometrist shall notify the board in writing.</p>
                <p>(e) The board may issue a license by endorsement to engage in the practice of optometry to an applicant who is currently licensed in another United States or Canadian jurisdiction with substantially equivalent requirements as Wyoming and who meets Wyoming requirements for licensure by endorsement. Applicants for licensure by endorsement shall comply with standards set forth in board rules.</p>

                <p>(b) For purposes of this section, a person shall be considered retired from practice if the person's license or certificate has expired.</p>
                <p>(c) The state board of optometry may issue, with or without examination, a volunteer certificate to a person who is retired from practice so that the person may provide optometry services to low income uninsured persons at nonprofit health care facilities.

                <p>(d) An application for a volunteer's certificate shall include all of the following:</p>
                <p>(i) A copy of the applicant's optometry degree;</p>

                <p>(A) A copy of the applicant's most recent license or certificate authorizing the practice of optometry issued by a jurisdiction in the United States that licenses persons to practice optometry; or</p>

The board shall not charge a fee for issuing or renewing a certificate pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p>(g) To be eligible for renewal of a volunteer's certificate, the holder of the certificate shall certify to the board completion of any continuing education required under this act as if the holder of the certificate were in active practice. The board shall not renew a certificate if the holder has not complied with the continuing education requirements. The nonprofit health care facility in which the holder provides optometric services may pay for or reimburse the holder for any costs incurred in obtaining the required continuing education.</p>
                <p>(h) The board shall issue to each person who qualifies under this section a volunteer's certificate that states the certificate holder is authorized to provide optometric services pursuant to the laws of this state.</p>
                <p>(j) Except as provided in this section, any person holding a volunteer certificate issued by the board under this section shall be subject to the requirements of this act and the jurisdiction of the board as if he were licensed to practice optometry under this act.</p>

                  <p>(i) Conviction of a felony or high misdemeanor that relates to the practice of pharmacy or to the ability to practice pharmacy, in which case the record of conviction or a copy thereof certified by the clerk or judge of the court in which the conviction is had shall be conclusive evidence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For renting or loaning to any person his or her license or diploma to be used as a license or diploma for such person;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For unprofessional conduct;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For knowingly submitting false or misleading information to the board in the application for a license or renewal of a license;</p>
                  <p>(v) For knowingly submitting false or misleading information to the board or its representative regarding the professional practice of the internship or professional practice of pharmacy by any other person;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Willful violation of any provision of this chapter or any willful violation of any of the provisions of the Wyoming Controlled Substances Act of 1971 or any amendments thereto;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Willful violation of any rules or regulations promulgated by the board in accordance with this chapter or the Wyoming Controlled Substances Act of 1971;</p>
                  <p>(viii) If the person's registration or license to practice has been refused, lapsed for cause, expired for cause, revoked for cause, or suspended for cause in this or any other jurisdiction or if the person has otherwise been disciplined by a board of pharmacy in this or any other jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(ix) For senility or mental impairment which impedes the pharmacist's professional abilities or for habitual personal use of morphine, cocaine or other habit forming drugs or alcohol; or</p>
                  <p>(x) For physical impairment which unnecessarily impedes the pharmacist's professional abilities and for which there can be no reasonable accommodation.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a person accused of violating subsection (a) of this section admits the violation, or the board finds the causes alleged to be true and determines that a letter of admonition or revocation or suspension of a license or registration is an inappropriate remedy, the board may assess an administrative penalty against that person of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each violation of this act or rule promulgated under this act, to be paid into the county treasury to the credit of the public school fund of the county in which the violation occurred. In addition to the penalty imposed under this subsection, the board may impose a license probation period upon that person, a violation of which is grounds for license revocation or suspension under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board may summarily suspend the license of any person holding a pharmacist license without a hearing if the board finds probable cause to believe that there is imminent danger to the public health or safety. The board may meet by telephone to consider summarily suspending a license if a quorum of the board is not available to meet in person under exigent circumstances. Summary suspension shall occur if the board determines there is probable cause to believe that continued practice by the licensee constitutes an imminent danger to the public health or safety. Proceedings for a disciplinary hearing shall be instituted simultaneously with the summary suspension. If the board does not commence the disciplinary hearing within thirty (30) days of the suspension order, the suspension shall be automatically vacated. At the written request of the suspended licensee in order to prepare for a hearing, the thirty (30) day period may be extended and the temporary suspension continued for an additional period not to exceed thirty (30) days.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided by subsections (b) and (c) of this section, proceedings under W.S. 33-24-122 may be taken by the board from matters within its knowledge, or may be taken upon the information of others; provided however, that if the informant is a member of the board, the other members of said board shall constitute the board for the purpose of finding judgment of the accused. The board shall, if it deems the charge sufficient, give notice by mail to the accused of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and afford the accused a hearing, as provided by law. All hearings or proceedings hereunder shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. If the accused does not appear, the board may proceed and determine the accusation in his absence. If the accused pleads guilty, or, upon the hearing the board shall find the causes alleged, or any of them to be true, it may proceed to judgment and may either revoke his registration and license, or merely revoke his license or suspend it for a specified period of time, or condition any of such sanctions on such future active or passive conduct of the offender as the board shall determine is reasonable, provided that such remedies are not exclusive and shall be in addition to other remedies provided by law. Upon revocation of any registration or license, the fact shall be noted upon the records of the board of pharmacy and the license shall be marked as cancelled upon the date of its revocation.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the executive director may subject to board approval and upon mutual agreement with a licensee, informally resolve violations of W.S. 33-24-122(a) and impose administrative penalties authorized under W.S. 33-24-122(b) in lieu of the proceedings specified under subsection (a) of this section. If the board disapproves the agreement and informal resolution, the agreement shall not:</p>
                  <p>(i) Constitute any admission by the licensee;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be admissible in any subsequent proceeding under this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Prohibit the director from filing a formal complaint;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Prohibit the licensee from contesting or objecting to a formal complaint filed by the director or from appealing the decision of the board.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon receipt from the department of family services of a certified copy of an order from a court to withhold, suspend or otherwise restrict a license issued by the board, the board shall notify the party named in the court order of the withholding, suspension or restriction of the license in accordance with the terms of the court order. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, no appeal under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act shall be allowed for a license withheld, suspended or restricted under this subsection.</p>

The purpose of the bond or other security shall be to secure payment of any fines or penalties imposed by the board and any fees and costs incurred by the board regarding the drug distributor's license which are authorized under state law and which remain unpaid thirty (30) days after liability for the payment is final. The board shall release the bond or security one (1) year after the distributor's license ceases to be valid.

                  <p>(i) Investigative notes, attorney’s notes and work product and reports, pleadings, correspondence, witness statements and deposition transcripts and copies of original medical and prescription records in the possession of the board, whether acquired by the board, by any agent of the board or by any agency that has cooperated with or provided information to the board regarding the investigation of a disciplinary docket; and</p>

                  <p>(b) A physician assistant assists in the practice of medicine under the supervision of a licensed physician. Within the physician/physician assistant relationship, physician assistants exercise autonomy in medical decision making and provide a broad range of diagnostic, therapeutic and health promotion and disease prevention services.

                  <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided by law and including the restriction in W.S. 33-26-510(c), a physician assistant acting within the scope of the physician assistant's practice may fulfill any requirement for a signature, certification, stamp, verification, affidavit, endorsement or other acknowledgement by a physician. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to expand the scope of practice of a physician assistant as provided in this article or to expand the duties and responsibilities delegated to a physician assistant by the physician assistant's supervising physician.</p>

                  <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2003, Ch. 190, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has graduated from a physician assistant program accredited by CAAHEP or its predecessor or successor organization;</p>

To allow the opportunity to take the next available certification examination, any temporary license issued pursuant to this subsection shall be issued for a period not to exceed one (1) year and under conditions as the board determines pursuant to W.S. 33-26-505.</p>
                  <p>(d) Physician assistants approved by the board prior to the effective date of this act are not required to be currently certified by the NCCPA. Graduation from a CAHEA approved program is considered equivalent to a CAAHEP program for purposes of licensure.</p>
                  <p>(e) The board shall formulate guidelines for consideration of applications by a licensed physician to supervise physician assistants. Any application shall include:</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>33-26-702. Compact provisions generally.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact is enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with all other states legally joining in the compact in a form substantially as follows.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I</p>
                  <p>Purpose</p>
                  <p>In order to strengthen access to health care and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards, provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing medical practice act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter and therefore requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.</p>

A member board may terminate the automatic suspension of the license it issued prior to the completion of the ninety (90) day suspension period in a manner consistent with the medical practice act of that state.</p>

The executive committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the interstate commission, with the exception of rulemaking, during periods when the interstate commission is not in session. When acting on behalf of the interstate commission, the executive committee shall oversee the administration of the compact including enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and rules and other such duties as necessary.</p>
                  <p>(n) The interstate commission may establish other committees for governance and administration of the compact.</p>

                  <p>(a) The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff. The total assessment must be sufficient to cover the annual budget approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources.

                  <p>(b) The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same.</p>

                  <p>(d) The interstate commission shall be subject to a yearly financial audit conducted by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in the annual report of the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XIV</p>
                  <p>Organization and operation of the Interstate Commission</p>
                  <p>(a) The interstate commission shall, by a majority of commissioners present and voting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact within twelve (12) months of the first interstate commission meeting.</p>
                  <p>(b) The interstate commission shall elect or appoint annually from among its commissioners a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson, or in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) Officers selected in subsection (b) of this article shall serve without remuneration from the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>(d) The officers and employees of the interstate commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of, or relating to, an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred, or that the officer or employee had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities provided that an officer or employee shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of the officer or employee. The immunity provided by this article shall be subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The liability of the executive director and employees of the interstate commission or representatives of the interstate commission, acting within the scope of the officer's or employee's employment or duties for acts, errors or omissions occurring within the officer's or employee's state, may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect the officer or employee from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of the officer or employee;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The interstate commission shall defend the executive director, its employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate commission representative, shall defend an interstate commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the officer or employee;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state or the interstate commission, the representatives or employees of the interstate commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney's fees and costs, obtained against the officers and employees arising out of an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities or that the officers and employees had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the officers or employees.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XV</p>
                  <p>Rulemaking functions of the Interstate Commission</p>
                  <p>(a) The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</p>
                  <p>(b) Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the interstate commission shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Model State Administrative Procedure Act" of 2010 and subsequent amendments thereto.</p>
                  <p>(c) Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XVI</p>
                  <p>Oversight of Interstate Compact</p>
                  <p>(a) The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of the compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law but shall not override existing state authority to regulate the practice of medicine.</p>
                  <p>(b) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, the compact or promulgated rules.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XVII</p>
                  <p>Enforcement of Interstate Compact</p>
                  <p>(a) The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
                  <p>(c) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XVIII</p>
                  <p>Default Procedures</p>
                  <p>(a) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the compact or the rules and bylaws of the interstate commission promulgated under the compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by the compact shall terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.</p>
                  <p>(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and each of the member states.</p>
                  <p>(e) The interstate commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state or the withdrawal of a member state.</p>
                  <p>(f) The member state which has been terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
                  <p>(g) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
                  <p>(h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XIX</p>
                  <p>Dispute Resolution</p>
                  <p>(a) The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states or member boards.</p>
                  <p>(b) The interstate commission shall promulgate rules providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution as appropriate.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XX</p>
                  <p>Member States, Effective Date and Amendments</p>
                  <p>(a) Any state is eligible to become a member state of the compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than seven (7) states. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding on a state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state.</p>
                  <p>(c) The governors of nonmember states or their designees, shall be invited to participate in the activities of the interstate commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.</p>
                  <p>(d) The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XXI</p>
                  <p>Withdrawal</p>
                  <p>(a) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state, provided that a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.</p>
                  <p>(b) Withdrawal from the compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one (1) year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member state.</p>
                  <p>(c) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the withdrawing state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The interstate commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt of notice provided under subsection (c) of this article.</p>
                  <p>(e) The withdrawing state is responsible for all dues, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>(f) Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>(g) The interstate commission is authorized to develop rules to address the impact of the withdrawal of a member state on licenses granted in other member states to physicians who designated the withdrawing member state as the state of principal license.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XXII</p>
                  <p>Dissolution</p>
                  <p>(a) The compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the compact to one (1) member state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon the dissolution of the compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XXIII</p>
                  <p>Severability and Construction</p>
                  <p>(a) The provisions of the compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.</p>
                  <p>(b) The provisions of the compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>

                  <p>(c) All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the commission, are binding upon the member states.</p>
                  <p>(d) All agreements between the interstate commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.</p>
                  <p>(e) In the event any provision of the compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.</p>

                  <p>(a) Each resident responsible broker shall lawfully establish at least one (1) but no more than three (3) real estate companies or sole proprietorships within Wyoming and acquire a license for each real estate company or sole proprietorship. Each resident responsible broker shall maintain a fixed principal office for each company or sole proprietorship within this state. The address of each office shall be designated on all licenses associated with the office and no license issued under this act shall authorize the licensee to transact real estate activity at any other address except a licensed branch office. In case of removal from a designated address, the responsible broker shall apply to the commission before the removal designating the new location of an office and paying the required fee, whereupon the commission shall issue a license for the new location for the unexpired period if the new location complies with the terms of this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) A responsible broker may conduct business from a branch office. A branch office shall use the same trade name or business name as the licensed real estate company. A company license shall be issued to the responsible broker for each branch office the responsible broker maintains. Every branch office shall be under the direction and supervision of the responsible broker. A responsible broker requesting a branch office license shall also, in addition to the branch office application, submit a plan of supervision for the branch office for approval by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) An associate broker or salesperson shall not be associated or engaged under contract to any other responsible broker than is designated upon the license issued to the associate broker or salesperson. Upon termination of an associate broker's or salesperson's association or contractual relationship, his responsible broker shall immediately notify the commission for cancellation of the associate broker's or salesperson's license. Whenever a licensed associate broker or salesperson desires to change his contractual relationship from one (1) responsible broker to another, he shall notify the commission promptly in writing of the facts attendant thereon and pay the required fee. Upon application, the commission shall issue a new license under the new responsible broker. No associate broker or salesperson shall directly or indirectly associate himself with a responsible broker until he has been issued a license to do so with that responsible broker.</p>
                  <p>(d) No more than one (1) license to conduct real estate activity shall be issued to any responsible broker, associate broker or salesperson to be in effect at one (1) time except as provided in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(d) Any licensee whose license has expired as provided in this section after the grace period has ended, shall comply with all requirements of a new applicant, including writing the appropriate examination, before a license will be reissued.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any real estate associate broker or salesperson who is not employed by or associated with a responsible broker, or any responsible broker who desires to become inactive, may renew his license in an inactive status prior to the renewal deadline established in this section, by submitting the renewal fee together with a completed renewal application on which he has noted his present inactive status.</p>
                  <p>(f) A license on inactive status for more than three (3) years shall not be reissued on an active status unless the licensee has first met the educational requirements under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) A license on an inactive status for less than three (3) years may be renewed on an active status prior to the renewal deadline by submitting the renewal fee together with a renewal application.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>33-28-122. Responsible broker's trust accounts; disposition of interest; commingling with personal funds prohibited; disputed deposits; cooperative transactions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Every responsible broker licensed by the commission in this state shall comply with the following provisions for each licensed real estate company he supervises:</p>
                  <p>(i) Maintain an account in a financial institution in this state designated as a trust or escrow account in which all down payments, earnest money deposits, advance listing fees or other trust funds received by him, his associate brokers or his salespersons on behalf of a principal or any other person shall be deposited unless all persons having an interest in the funds have agreed otherwise in writing. The account shall permit immediate withdrawal of the funds deposited therein. In lieu of maintaining a trust or escrow account under this paragraph, a responsible broker may use a funds holder;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Notify the real estate commission on forms it prescribes of the name of the financial institution in which a trust account is maintained and the name of the account. If the responsible broker uses a funds holder and deposits monies with the funds holder, his intention to use a funds holder and the name of the funds holder shall be disclosed to all parties to any contract, purchase agreement, lease or lease agreement negotiated by him. The responsible broker shall identify all funds holders used by the broker and notify the real estate commission in writing that he uses and deposits monies with the funds holder;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Permit the commission or its representative to examine the responsible broker's trust accounting records;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Upon cancellation of his license for any reason, maintain the trust account until all deposits have been properly disbursed.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a responsible broker's branch office maintains a separate trust account, the office shall maintain a separate bookkeeping system.</p>
                  <p>(c) A trust account maintained by a responsible broker under this section may be interest bearing or noninterest bearing. Any interest accrued on any deposit in a trust account shall be paid out as agreed in writing by all persons having an interest in the deposit. In the absence of a written agreement among all persons having an interest in the deposit, at the time all or any portion of any deposit is withdrawn and paid out, all interest accrued upon the funds withdrawn and paid out shall also be withdrawn and paid out to the person from whom the trust funds were received; provided, if the funds are required to be disbursed to more than one (1) person, each person entitled to receive any portion of the deposit shall also be paid a portion of the interest in the same proportion as the funds withdrawn and paid out to each person bears to the total deposit.</p>
                  <p>(d) A licensee is not entitled to any part of the earnest money or other item of value given to him in connection with any real estate transaction as part or all of his compensation or fee until the transaction has been consummated or terminated.</p>
                  <p>(e) No responsible broker shall permit an advance payment of funds belonging to others to be deposited in the responsible broker's personal account or be commingled with his personal funds. It will not be considered commingling if, when establishing the trust account, the responsible broker deposits some of his funds to keep the account open or to avoid charges for a minimum balance, so long as that deposit is identified at the time of deposit. No responsible broker shall use deposits in a trust account for a purpose other than the transaction for which they were provided.</p>
                  <p>(f) In the event of a dispute over the return or forfeiture of any deposit held by a responsible broker, the responsible broker shall continue to hold the deposit in a trust account until he has a written release from the parties consenting to its disposition, until a civil action is filed or the responsible broker interpleads all parties, at which time it may be paid to the court.</p>
                  <p>(g) Unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the contract, in a cooperative transaction in which the responsible broker working with a buyer receives cash or a check as earnest money, the responsible broker shall deliver the contract and the cash or check to the responsible broker working with the seller who shall deposit the cash or check in his trust account. If the responsible broker working with a buyer receives a promissory note, or thing of value, the note or thing of value shall be delivered with the contract to the responsible broker working with the seller, who shall hold the note or thing of value.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>33-28-302. Relationships between licensees and the public.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A responsible broker shall not be required to offer or engage in more than one (1) of the broker relationships. When engaged in any real estate activity, a licensee, with permission of the licensee's responsible broker, may act in any real estate transaction as an agent or intermediary or may work with the seller or buyer as a customer. The licensee's duties and obligations arising from that relationship shall be disclosed to the seller or buyer pursuant to this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) When engaged in any real estate activity, a licensee may act as an agent only pursuant to a written agreement with the seller or buyer which discloses the duties and responsibilities set forth in W.S. 33-28-303 or 33-28-304.</p>
                  <p>(c) When engaged in any real estate activity, a licensee may act as a subagent with the duties and responsibilities set forth in W.S. 33-28-303(g) only pursuant to a written agreement between the seller and the seller's agent authorizing an offer of subagency to other responsible brokers, or as an intermediary with the seller or buyer, pursuant to a written agreement that discloses the duties and responsibilities set forth in W.S. 33-28-305.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 20, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(e) A licensee may work with a single party in separate transactions pursuant to different relationships, for example, selling one (1) property as a seller's agent and working with that seller in buying another property as an intermediary or buyer's agent, if the licensee complies with this article in establishing a separate relationship in writing for each transaction.</p>
                  <p>(f) A licensee may complete real estate forms and shall explain to the parties the effects thereof if the licensee is performing real estate activities in the transaction in which the forms are to be used.</p>
                  <p>(g) Every contract, duty or relationship within this article, including intermediary or customer relationships, imposes an obligation of good faith and fair dealing in its performance or enforcement.</p>
                  <p>(h) If a real estate company has more than one (1) licensee, the responsible broker and any licensee associated with or engaged by that responsible broker may be designated to work with the seller or the buyer as a designated licensee. For an in-house real estate transaction, the designated licensee shall be:</p>
                  <p>(i) A responsible broker;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An associate broker;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A salesperson under the direct supervision of a responsible broker, and the responsible broker is not a party to the real estate transaction; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) A salesperson who is under the direct supervision of a transaction manager.</p>
                  <p>(j) Licensees employed or engaged by the same responsible broker or across any companies the same responsible broker supervises may be designated licensees for different buyers or sellers in the same transaction. If the responsible broker is representing a buyer or a seller in an in-house transaction, the responsible broker shall immediately appoint a transaction manager unless the other licensee is an associate broker. If the responsible broker is representing a buyer or seller in a transaction involving two (2) or more companies the responsible broker manages, he shall immediately appoint a transaction manager for each real estate company unless the other licensee is an associate broker. The responsible broker shall disclose in every real estate transaction to all parties involved the names of all real estate companies the responsible broker supervises. The simultaneous designations shall not constitute dual agency or require the responsible broker or licensee to act as an intermediary unless otherwise required by this article. A responsible broker or transaction manager shall have access to all necessary information but shall be prohibited from sharing any confidential information of any party to the transaction that the responsible broker or transaction manager may learn in the process of supervising the licensees or the transaction.</p>
                  <p>(k) A licensee may work as an agent for the seller treating the buyer as a customer or as an agent for the buyer treating the seller as a customer but not as an agent for both the seller and the buyer. A licensee may be designated to work as an intermediary for both the seller and the buyer in the same transaction pursuant to W.S. 33-28-307. The applicable designated relationship shall be disclosed in writing to the seller and buyer at the earliest reasonable opportunity. A designated licensee is not precluded from working with a buyer or seller in a real estate transaction solely because the licensee was precluded from representing that person in an earlier separate real estate transaction.</p>
                  <p>(m) No seller or buyer shall be vicariously liable for an agent's acts or omissions that have not been approved, directed or ratified by the seller or buyer.</p>
                  <p>(n) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the responsible broker's responsibility to supervise licensees associated with the responsible broker or real estate company or to shield the responsible broker from vicarious liability.</p>
                  <p>(o) A licensee shall not establish dual agency with any seller or buyer.</p>
                  <p>(p) A customer relationship shall exist between a licensee and any party to a real estate transaction unless a single agency or intermediary relationship is established through a written agreement between the licensee and the party or parties. When a buyer or seller has a written listing agreement with a licensee, another licensee may work with the other buyer or seller as a customer, having no written agreement, agency or intermediary relationship with any party. A licensee shall not owe any duty of confidentiality to a customer.</p>
                  <p>(q) Proprietary ownership interest of written listing agreements shall be vested in the responsible broker.</p>

                  <p>(i) That a seller is willing to accept less than the asking price for the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) What the motivating factors are for the party selling the property;</p>
                  <p>(iii) That the seller will agree to financing terms other than those offered;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any material information about the seller unless disclosure is required by law or failure to disclose the information would constitute fraud or dishonest dealing.</p>
                  <p>(c) A licensee acting as a seller's agent owes no duty or obligation to the buyer, except that a licensee shall disclose to any prospective buyer all adverse material facts actually known by the licensee.

                  <p>(f) A seller may agree in writing with a seller's agent to extend an offer of subagency to other responsible brokers to cooperate in selling the real estate.</p>

                  <p>(a) For purposes of this section, open house showings, preliminary conversations and requests for factual information do not constitute discussions or arrangements incidental to a sale, purchase, exchange or lease of real estate. Prior to engaging in any discussion or arrangement incidental to a sale, purchase, exchange or lease of real estate, and, prior to entering into any written agreement with a buyer or seller, a licensee shall make a written disclosure of applicable agency, intermediary or customer relationships which shall contain at a minimum the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) A description of all the different agency, intermediary and customer relationships allowed by this article and a statement that the compensation for different relationships is negotiable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An explanation of the duties and obligations owed under each such relationship;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A conspicuous statement of duties and obligations owed by an agent but which are not owed by an intermediary;</p>

                  <p>(v) A statement that an intermediary is not an agent or advocate for any party and has only the obligations set forth in W.S. 33-28-305;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A statement that the seller or buyer may be vicariously liable for acts of the agent, subagent or intermediary if the seller or buyer approves, directs or ratifies the acts; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) A statement that a customer shall not be afforded any confidentiality in any communication to or with the licensee.</p>
                  <p>(b) The written disclosure shall contain a signature line for the buyer or seller to acknowledge receipt of the disclosure. The disclosure and acknowledgment, by itself, shall not constitute a contract or agreement with the licensee. Until the buyer or seller executes such acknowledgment, no representation agreement shall be executed or valid except, provided if a buyer or seller refuses to sign the disclosure after presentation by the licensee:</p>
                  <p>(i) The licensee may document the refusal with a signed acknowledgement by the licensee and continue with the transaction; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The disclosure and acknowledgement shall be attached to and may become incorporated into any written agreements with the buyer or seller as prescribed in W.S. 33-28-302(b) and (c).</p>
                  <p>(c) A licensee who has established an agency relationship, a subagency relationship or an intermediary relationship with a seller or buyer shall provide notice of that relationship to any other party to the transaction at the earliest reasonable opportunity.</p>
                  <p>(d) Disclosures made in accordance with this article shall be sufficient to disclose agency, intermediary and customer relationships to the parties to the transaction and to the public.</p>

                  <p>(a) In any real estate transaction, the responsible broker's compensation may be paid by the seller, the buyer, a third party, or by the sharing or splitting of compensation between responsible brokers.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment of compensation shall not be construed to establish an agency relationship or intermediary relationship between the responsible broker and the party who paid the compensation.</p>
                  <p>(c) A seller may agree that an intermediary, buyer's agent, subagent or a licensee working with a buyer as a customer may share in the compensation paid by the seller with another responsible broker.</p>
                  <p>(d) A buyer may agree that a seller's agent, intermediary, subagent or a licensee working with a seller as a customer may share in the compensation paid by the buyer with another responsible broker.</p>
                  <p>(e) A buyer's agent shall obtain the written approval of the buyer before the buyer's agent may propose to the seller's agent that the buyer's agent be compensated by sharing compensation paid by the seller.</p>

                  <p>(g) A responsible broker may be compensated by more than one (1) party for services in a transaction, if those parties have consented in writing to the shared payment prior to seller and buyer entering into a contract to buy or sell.</p>
                  <p>(h) An agreement authorizing a responsible broker who originally agreed in writing to act as an agent to a buyer or seller with respect to a particular real estate transaction to act instead as an intermediary to that party, shall provide that the party agreeing to the new relationship shall not be liable for any compensation greater than the compensation the party would have been liable to pay under the initial agreement. Any contract provision in violation of this subsection is void and unenforceable.</p>

                  <p>(a) Beginning January 1, 2008, an applicant for a real estate license pursuant to W.S. 33-28-106, a licensee renewing a license or an inactive licensee activating a license pursuant to W.S. 33-28-118, shall submit proof of insurance coverage through the group program provided pursuant to this section or through certification of individual coverage. All licensees shall obtain and maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage under the group program or individual coverage.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission shall make errors and omissions insurance available to all licensees by contracting with an insurer for a group program after competitive bidding. Any group program obtained by the commission shall be available to all licensees and shall prevent the insurer from canceling any licensee. Licensees may obtain errors and omissions insurance independently if the coverage complies with the minimum requirements established by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to specify the terms and conditions of coverage required under this section, including the minimum limits and terms of the coverage, the permissible deductible and permissible exemptions. Each licensee shall be notified of the required terms and conditions at least thirty (30) days prior to the license renewal date. Each licensee who elects not to participate in the group program administered by the commission shall file a certificate of coverage showing compliance with the required terms and conditions with the commission by the license renewal date.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the commission is unable to obtain errors and omissions insurance coverage to insure all licensees who elect to participate in the group program, at a reasonable annual premium not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) per licensee, the errors and omissions insurance requirement of this section shall not apply during the year for which the commission cannot obtain the errors and omissions insurance coverage. The maximum premium amount shall be adjusted annually by the annual rate of inflation in this state for the preceding twelve (12) month period as calculated by the department of administration and information.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commission shall charge and collect an administrative fee in addition to the premium paid from each licensee who obtains errors and omissions insurance through the group program. This administrative fee shall be of an amount sufficient to cover the administration of this section and shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the premium. The maximum premium specified in subsection (d) of this section applies only to premium cost and not to any administrative fee charged.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed By Laws 2011, Ch. 104, § 2.</p>

                  <p>SECTION 1 PURPOSE</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this Compact is to facilitate interstate practice of audiology and speech-language pathology with the goal of improving public access to audiology and speech-language pathology services. The practice of audiology and speech- language pathology occurs in the state where the patient/client/student is located at the time of the patient/client/student encounter. The Compact preserves the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through the current system of state licensure. This Compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:</p>
                  <p>1. Increase public access to audiology and speech-language pathology services by providing for the mutual recognition of other member state licenses;</p>
                  <p>2. Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety;</p>
                  <p>3. Encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating multistate audiology and speech-language pathology practice;</p>
                  <p>4. Support spouses of relocating active duty military personnel;</p>
                  <p>5. Enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative and disciplinary information between member states;</p>
                  <p>6. Allow a remote state to hold a provider of services with a compact privilege in that state accountable to that state's practice standards; and 7. Allow for the use of telehealth technology to facilitate increased access to audiology and speech-language pathology services.</p>

                  <p>F. If an audiologist or speech-language pathologist changes primary state of residence by moving from a member state to a non-member state, the license issued by the prior home state shall convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.</p>
                  <p>G. The compact privilege is valid until the expiration date of the home state license. The licensee shall comply with the requirements of Section 4(A) of this compact to maintain the compact privilege in the remote state.</p>

                  <p>J. If a home state license is encumbered, the licensee shall lose the compact privilege in any remote state until the following occur:</p>

                  <p>K. Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to good standing, the licensee shall meet the requirements of Section 4(A) of this compact to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.</p>
                  <p>L. Once the requirements of Section 4(J) of this compact have been met, the licensee shall meet the requirements in Section 4(A) of this compact to obtain a compact privilege in a remote state.</p>

                  <p>SECTION 7</p>
                  <p>ADVERSE ACTIONS</p>
                  <p>A. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, as follows:</p>
                  <p>1. A remote state may take adverse action against an audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's privilege to practice within that member state;</p>
                  <p>2. A remote state may issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;</p>
                  <p>3. Notwithstanding Section 7(A)(1) and (2) of this compact, only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's license issued by the home state.</p>
                  <p>B. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.</p>
                  <p>C. The home state shall complete any pending investigations of an audiologist or speech-language pathologist who changes primary state of residence during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions.</p>
                  <p>D. If otherwise permitted by state law, the home state may recover from the affected audiologist or speech-language pathologist the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that audiologist or speech-language pathologist.</p>
                  <p>E. The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the home state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.</p>
                  <p>F. Joint Investigations:</p>
                  <p>1. In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective audiology or speech-language pathology practice act or other applicable state law, any member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees;</p>
                  <p>2. Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the Compact.</p>
                  <p>G. If adverse action is taken by the home state against an audiologist's or speech language pathologist's license, the audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's privilege to practice in all other member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an audiologist's or speech language pathologist's license shall include a statement that the audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's privilege to practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.</p>
                  <p>H. If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home state of any adverse actions by remote states.</p>
                  <p>I. Nothing in this Compact shall override a member state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.</p>
                  <p>SECTION 8</p>
                  <p>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AUDIOLOGY AND SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY COMPACT COMMISSION</p>

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees;</p>
                  <p>3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>
                  <p>SECTION 12</p>
                  <p>DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR AUDIOLOGY AND SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT</p>
                  <p>A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.</p>

                  <p>PURPOSE</p>
                  <p>In order to protect the public through verification of competency and ensure accountability for patient care related activities all states license emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs), advanced EMTs and paramedics. This Compact is intended to facilitate the day to day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS personnel licensed in a member state. This Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of EMS personnel and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. This Compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:</p>
                  <p>1. Increase public access to EMS personnel;</p>
                  <p>2. Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially patient safety;</p>

Nothing in this Compact shall override a member state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain non-public if required by the member state's laws. Member states must require individuals who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in any other member state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from such other member state.</p>

                  <p>SECTION 12</p>
                  <p>RULEMAKING</p>
                  <p>A. The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.</p>
                  <p>B. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states reject a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.</p>
                  <p>C. Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.</p>
                  <p>D. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:</p>
                  <p>1. On the website of the Commission; and 2. On the website of each member state EMS authority or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.</p>
                  <p>E. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:</p>
                  <p>1. The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;</p>
                  <p>2. The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule;</p>

                  <p>F. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.</p>
                  <p>G. The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:</p>
                  <p>1. At least twenty-five (25) persons;</p>

                  <p>2. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.</p>
                  <p>3.

This subsection shall not preclude the Commission from making a transcript or recording of the hearing if it so chooses.</p>
                  <p>4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.</p>

                  <p>J. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.</p>

Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.</p>
                  <p>SECTION 13</p>
                  <p>OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT</p>
                  <p>A. Oversight.</p>
                  <p>1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</p>
                  <p>2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.</p>
                  <p>3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.</p>
                  <p>B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination.</p>
                  <p>1. If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:</p>
                  <p>a. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and</p>
                  <p>b. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p>
                  <p>2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</p>
                  <p>3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.</p>
                  <p>4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
                  <p>5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.</p>
                  <p>6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
                  <p>C. Dispute Resolution.</p>
                  <p>1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states.</p>
                  <p>2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</p>
                  <p>D. Enforcement.</p>
                  <p>1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.</p>
                  <p>2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
                  <p>3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>
                  <p>SECTION 14</p>
                  <p>DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR EMS PERSONNEL PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT</p>
                  <p>A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.</p>
                  <p>B. Any state that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.</p>
                  <p>C. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</p>
                  <p>1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.</p>
                  <p>2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.</p>
                  <p>E. This Compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.</p>
                  <p>SECTION 15</p>
                  <p>CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</p>
                  <p>This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states. Nothing in this Compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS</p>

                <p>(e) On payment of an additional fee established pursuant to W.S. 33-47-105(a)(v), the board may extend a permit to practice dietetics for an additional period not to exceed six (6) months from the date of issuance of the original permit.</p>
                <p>(f) Upon payment of a fee established pursuant to W.S. 33-47-105(a)(v), the board shall issue a license to practice dietetics to an applicant who was a dietitian registered prior to July 1, 2011 by the commission or its equivalent.</p>

                <p>(a) Any person who violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be subject to the fines and penalties prescribed in W.S. 6-10-103.

The district court of the district in which the offending person resides or the district court of Laramie county has original jurisdiction of any such injunction proceedings. An injunction may be issued without proof of actual damage sustained and upon proof of one (1) or more acts constituting the practice of acupuncture without a license. The standard of proof of any violation of this subsection shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
                <p>(c) Nothing in this section shall limit any additional civil or criminal liability under the laws of this state.</p>
