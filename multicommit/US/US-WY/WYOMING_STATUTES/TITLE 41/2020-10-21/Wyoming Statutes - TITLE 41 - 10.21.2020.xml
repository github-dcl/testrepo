                  <p>(ii) Only political subdivisions that own or have the legal responsibility to operate or maintain irrigation infrastructure shall be eligible for emergency water project funding.</p>
                  <p>(h) The commission shall adopt rules providing for eligibility determination, procedures and criteria for the application and award of funds from the emergency water projects account. The total amount awarded under this subsection shall not exceed three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) per fiscal biennium. The maximum grant amount awarded for each emergency project shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the total emergency project costs, the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) may be funded by the commission in the form of a loan.

                  <p>(a) Pursuant to W.S. 41-3-115, the United States Bureau of Reclamation and the Wyoming water development office are hereby authorized to transfer a maximum of thirty-three thousand four hundred ninety-three (33,493) acre feet of storage water per year from the environmental account in the Pathfinder Modification Project within Pathfinder reservoir to the Wyoming- Nebraska state line for the purpose of providing regulatory certainty under the Endangered Species Act for the use of Wyoming water in the Platte River basin.</p>
                  <p>(b) Pursuant to W.S. 41-3-115, and the Wyoming water development office is hereby authorized to transfer a maximum of nine thousand six hundred (9,600) acre feet of storage water per year from the Wyoming account in the Pathfinder Modification Project within Pathfinder reservoir to the Wyoming-Nebraska state line through annual temporary water use agreements with the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program in any year the storage water in the Wyoming account is not needed by the state of Wyoming as a municipal water supply or a replacement water supply to meet the state of Wyoming's obligations in the Nebraska v. Wyoming settlement agreement and the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program.</p>
                  <p>(c) The authorizations granted under subsections (a) and</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section shall terminate if the state of Wyoming withdraws from the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program or any successor programs approved by the governor.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the director of the Wyoming water development office determines that Wyoming water users are not receiving the regulatory certainty under the endangered species act as provided for in the Platte River recovery implementation program, he shall submit a report to the select water committee outlining the inadequacy of the regulatory certainty.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the state engineer determines that the transfers authorized under subsections (a) and (b) of this section cause injury to Wyoming water users beyond those identified in the final opinion and recommendations provided to the legislature pursuant to W.S. 41-3-115(q), then the state engineer shall report the injury to the select water committee.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any revenue generated through the annual temporary water use agreements for storage water from the Wyoming account shall be deposited in the account created by W.S. 41-2-1001(a)(iv).</p>

                  <p>A water right is a right to use the water of the state, when such use has been acquired by the beneficial application of water under the laws of the state relating thereto, and in conformity with the rules and regulations dependent thereon. Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and limit of the right to use water at all times, not exceeding the statutory limit except as provided by W.S. 41-4-317. In addition to any beneficial use specified by law or rule and regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, the use of water for the purpose of extracting heat therefrom is considered a beneficial use subject to prior rights. Water being always the property of the state, rights to its use shall attach to the land for irrigation, or to such other purposes or object for which acquired in accordance with the beneficial use made for which the right receives public recognition, under the law and the administration provided thereby. Water rights for the direct use of the natural unstored flow of any stream cannot be detached from the lands, place or purpose for which they are acquired, except as provided in W.S. 41-3-102 and 41-3-103, pertaining to a change to preferred use, and except as provided in W.S. 41-4-514.</p>

                  <p>(b) Preferred water uses shall have preference rights in the following order:</p>
                  <p>(i) Water for drinking purposes for both man and beast;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Water for municipal purposes;</p>

                  <p>(a) When an owner of a water right wishes to change a water right from its present use to another use, or from the place of use under the existing right to a new place of use, he shall file a petition requesting permission to make such a change. The petition shall set forth all pertinent facts about the existing use and the proposed change in use, or, where a change in place of use is requested, all pertinent information about the existing place of use and the proposed place of use. The board may require that an advertised public hearing or hearings be held at the petitioner's expense. The petitioner shall provide a transcript of the public hearing to the board. The change in use, or change in place of use, may be allowed, provided that the quantity of water transferred by the granting of the petition shall not exceed the amount of water historically diverted under the existing use, nor exceed the historic rate of diversion under the existing use, nor increase the historic amount consumptively used under the existing use, nor decrease the historic amount of return flow, nor in any manner injure other existing lawful appropriators. The board of control shall consider all facts it believes pertinent to the transfer which may include the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The economic loss to the community and the state if the use from which the right is transferred is discontinued;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The extent to which such economic loss will be offset by the new use;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether other sources of water are available for the new use.</p>
                  <p>(b) In all cases where the matter of compensation is in dispute, the question of compensation shall be submitted to the proper district court for determination.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-106. Procedure to exchange water; delivery of water under exchanges; approval of state engineer; enforcement of exchanges.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any appropriator owning a valid water right in and to the use of the ground, surface or reservoir waters of the state, where the source of the appropriation is at times insufficient to fully satisfy such appropriation, or better conservation and utilization of the state's water can be accomplished, or the appropriator can develop appropriable water but cannot economically convey it to its point of use, may petition the state engineer for an order allowing an exchange and the use of stored, direct flow, or ground water from another source. If such an appropriator arranges by agreement with another appropriator for the delivery and use of either stored, direct flow, or ground water from another source, the exchange agreement shall accompany the petition.</p>
                  <p>(b) Exchanges may be allowed among any combination of direct flow, storage, and groundwater rights. Petitions for exchanges shall be accompanied by such maps, plans or other information as may be required by the state engineer. The proper filing and recording fees shall accompany the petition.</p>
                  <p>(c) No exchange shall be allowed until the state engineer has entered an order granting the exchange. Documents drawn in connection with exchanges may be recorded in one (1) or more counties where any part of the land involved is situated. No exchange may be terminated without the issuance of an order approving termination, unless the order allowing the exchange provides for termination on a specified date.</p>
                  <p>(d) It is the policy of the state to encourage exchanges. The state engineer shall not issue an exchange order if it appears that the proposed exchange would adversely affect other appropriators, or if the proposed exchange would, in the opinion of the state engineer, be too difficult to administer or would be adverse to the public interest. All exchanges are subject to the requirements of beneficial use and equality of water exchanged, and no exchange will be allowed unless a sufficient quantity of makeup water is introduced to replace the water diverted and withdrawn under the exchange. In making the determination of equality and sufficiency of the makeup water introduced, the state engineer may consider relative consumptive uses and transmission losses.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any water made available to an appropriator by reason of any exchange agreement shall be delivered for the use of the appropriator in accordance with the order allowing the exchange, and its use is without prejudice to, but in enjoyment of, the rights of all appropriators under their original appropriations.</p>
                  <p>(f) Performances of each exchange shall be enforced by the water administration officials of the state in accordance with the terms and conditions of the order allowing the exchange. The state engineer may adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary to enable him to efficiently administer this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) The state engineer shall assess a fee not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) for his review, and approval of exchange petitions. This fee shall accompany an exchange petition and shall be retained and deposited whether the petition or request is approved or denied.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state board of control may, upon the written petition of the owners of an adjudicated water right, or water rights appurtenant to lands submerged by the construction of reservoirs in the state of Wyoming, issue amended certificates of appropriation of water and change the point of diversion and means of conveyance for such adjudicated appropriations of water for the irrigation of other lands in the state of Wyoming outside of the reservoir basin in lieu of the submerged lands, without loss of priority; provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) The appropriation shall be from the same source of supply;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The irrigated acreage shall include not only new land within the state of Wyoming having no original direct flow water right but also lands within the same drainage area having water rights from another source and which have a need for supplemental water, but in no event shall such right and use so changed exceed in amount of water that of the rights which are being changed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Such change of water rights be made within five (5) years from the date that construction of the reservoir dam has been completed. If such change is not applied for by the owner or his successors in interest within the five (5) year period such water rights shall become automatically abandoned and the water shall be distributed in order of priority on the stream. Such automatic abandonment shall apply only to lands inundated at and below the high water line of reservoirs. The board of control shall enter an order abandoning the water rights upon a determination that an abandonment has occurred;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The change can be made only on condition that it does not injuriously affect the rights of other Wyoming appropriators.</p>
                  <p>(b) After receipt of a petition for such change the state board of control shall cause a public hearing to be held on the petition before the superintendent of the water division in which such appropriation is located, with notice of the hearing to be advertised in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper having general circulation in the community where the water right involved is located. The petitioner shall pay the cost of publication prior to the time of hearing and shall provide a stenographic record of the proceedings, which shall be transmitted by the division superintendent to the state board of control with his report. A fee not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) for issuance and recording of each amended certificate of appropriation of water shall be collected by the state board of control at the time of filing of the petition and the board shall also require a deposit of sufficient funds to cover the cost of preparing and recording a certified copy of the order of the board granting the petition.</p>
                  <p>(c) The owners of lands coming under the provisions of this section may sell or convey lands submerged or to be submerged by any such reservoir with provisions in the deed or other conveyance that the water rights appurtenant thereto may be detached and transferred as provided herein.</p>

                  <p>(a) Where lands are taken out of agricultural production as the necessary result of acquisitions for railroad roadbed construction, highway construction, mining or petroleum extraction operations or industrial site acquisitions or lands taken by proceedings in eminent domain or which have become impracticable to irrigate by reason of any of the foregoing conditions, the owner of an affected water right may transfer the water right to other lands held by the owner. The petition for the change in use, or change in place of use shall be properly filed within five (5) years of the date the land went out of production because of any of the conditions specified herein. Failure to file the petition within five (5) years results in forfeiture of the right except as otherwise provided.</p>
                  <p>(b) The petition for a change in use, or change in place of use, of a water right under this section shall retain its original date of priority.</p>
                  <p>(c) For a period of five (5) years after the effective date of this act, any appropriator whose land has been out of production for more than five (5) years may petition the board requesting transfer of the water rights involved. The granting or denial of a petition under these circumstances is within the discretion of the board. The decision of the board may be appealed to the district court. The board may hold public hearings in connection with a petition being considered pursuant to this section. All costs in conjunction with the hearing shall be borne by the petitioner.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-110. Right to acquire temporary water rights for highway or railroad roadbed construction or repair; application; restrictions; fee.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any person shall have the right to acquire by purchase, gift or lease the right to the use of water which may be embraced in any adjudicated or valid unadjudicated water right, or any portion thereof, for a period of not to exceed two (2) years, for highway construction or repair, railroad roadbed construction or repair, drilling and producing operations, or other temporary purposes, on its own behalf or on behalf of its agents, employees or contractors: provided, that if the proposed use is to be for public highway construction or repair under a contract with the state department of transportation, only the state transportation commission shall have the authority to acquire the water; and the state transportation commission shall have the sole and continuing responsibility for the acquisition, including the payment of all fees, royalties and other consideration for the use of and access to water and the right to acquire the rights to use shall not be delegated to a construction contractor or other third party; and further provided, that any temporary transfer shall be allowed only if no other appropriator is injured thereby.</p>
                  <p>(b) Before any right to such use shall become operative, an application must be made in writing on a form provided or designated by the state engineer, with a copy of any conveyance or agreement provided, and it shall be filed in the office of the state engineer for his ratification and approval. Upon approval by the state engineer, an order authorizing such use and designating the method, place, and period of use may be entered. No loss, abandonment or impairment of such water rights shall occur or attach as a result of such change or use, except as provided by said conveyance or agreement and order of the state engineer, and upon termination of the temporary diversion and use, as stated in the order, any affected right to the use of water shall automatically be reinvested with all the rights, privileges and uses, and purposes theretofore held and enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>(c) Only that portion of a water right so acquired which has been consumptively used under the historical use made of the water right, may be diverted by a temporary user. In determining the consumptive use of water rights for the direct use of the natural unstored flow of any stream for irrigation purposes, the return flow from those rights shall be presumed to be fifty percent (50%). In those situations where an assumption of fifty percent (50%) return flow would be significantly in error, the state engineer shall have the prerogative of making a determination of the actual amount of return flow, and the amount of water which can be diverted for the temporary use provided herein shall be adjusted accordingly. The actual historic return flow, or the assumed return flow of fifty percent (50%) will be left in the stream for the use of downstream appropriators. The foregoing formula and procedure for the determination of consumptive use and return flow shall be limited to this section and shall have no application to any other statute of the state of Wyoming. Nothing herein contained shall be treated or construed as changing the prior use of water held by said owner or owners and as provided by the laws of the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(d) The state engineer shall assess a fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for his review and approval of temporary water agreements. This fee shall accompany the agreement application and shall be retained and credited to the general fund whether the agreement or request is approved or denied.</p>

Such supplemental supply permits or certificates of appropriation may be allowed by the state engineer or the state board of control under such regulations or conditions as he or it may prescribe. The use and administration of presently existing rights for supplemental supply appropriations or rights for supplemental supply appropriations hereafter acquired shall hereafter be made upon the express condition that the total amount of water to be diverted at any one (1) time both under a primary appropriation of water and a supplemental supply appropriation shall not be in excess of one (1) cubic foot of water per second of time for each seventy (70) acre tract so irrigated, except that when the right to divert water under the provisions of W.S. 41-4-317 through 41-4-324, is permitted the total amount of surplus water to be diverted at any one (1) time both under a primary appropriation of water and a supplemental supply appropriation shall not be in excess of one (1) cubic foot of water per second for each seventy (70) acre tract so irrigated.

                  <p>(i) The board of control if the use of the water has been adjudicated under a certificate of appropriation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The state engineer in all other cases. The state engineer may consider a petition even if water has not been applied to beneficial use however, any change in point of diversion granted by the state engineer shall be in the vicinity of the original diversion, and provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) The change shall not alter the original project concept; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The water shall be diverted from the same source of supply described in the original permit.</p>
                  <p>(b) Petitions for change in point of diversion shall be in affidavit form and shall set forth the name and address of the petitioner, the name of the ditch, pipeline, or other facility, the stream from which water is appropriated, the date of priority and the amount of the appropriation to be changed, permit number, ownership of appropriation, and the location of the present and the proposed new point of diversion by course and distance from a corner of the public land survey. If for irrigation, petitions shall describe the acreage irrigated in each legal subdivision, the reason for the proposed change, and state whether any other appropriator from the same source will be injured in any way, and whether the consent of all owners of intervening diversions has been obtained. The petition shall be accompanied by satisfactory evidence of ownership of the appropriation to be changed.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the petition is for a change in point of diversion and means of conveyance for all or a part of an appropriation, it shall include, in addition to the foregoing, the name, permit number and date of priority of the ditch or facility to which it is to be changed, and whether the petitioner is the sole owner of both facilities involved or has the consent of the other owners of both ditches or facilities.</p>

                  <p>(a) The legislature finds, recognizes and declares that the transfer of water outside the boundaries of the state may have a significant impact on the water and other resources of the state. Further, this impact may differ substantially from that caused by uses of the water within the state. Therefore, all water being the property of the state and part of the natural resources of the state, it shall be controlled and managed by the state for the purposes of protecting, conserving and preserving to the state the maximum permanent beneficial use of the state's waters.</p>
                  <p>(b) None of the water of the state either surface or underground may be appropriated, stored or diverted for use outside of the state or for use as a medium of transportation of mineral, chemical or other products to another state without the specific prior approval of the legislature. Provided, however, neither approval by the legislature nor compliance with the application procedures under subsections (m) through (r) of this section shall be required for appropriations that will transfer or use outside the state less than one thousand (1,000) acre- feet of water per year unless the applications are part of a collection of related applications or appropriations from the same source of supply for the same or similar use where the total use or transfer outside the state exceeds one thousand (1,000) acre-feet per year in aggregate. The state engineer is authorized to adopt rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) No holder of either a permit to appropriate water or a certificate to appropriate water, nor any applicant for a right to appropriate the unappropriated water of this state, may transfer or use the water so appropriated, certificated or applied for outside the state of Wyoming without prior approval of the legislature of Wyoming.</p>

                  <p>(m) Applications for the appropriation of water for use out of state shall be submitted to the state engineer. The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the state engineer to fully analyze the proposed appropriation. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the application, the state engineer shall determine if the application is complete and acceptable. If the application is unacceptable, the state engineer shall notify the applicant as to what is needed so an acceptable application may be submitted.</p>
                  <p>(n) Upon determination that the application is acceptable, the state engineer shall cause to be made, at the applicant's expense, a comprehensive review of the application. The state engineer shall have no more than one hundred twenty (120) days to complete this review.</p>
                  <p>(o) Upon completion of the state engineer's review, the state engineer shall issue a preliminary analysis of the application. The analysis shall address the factors set forth in subsection (r) of this section, contain a summary of the application and any other information the state engineer deems relevant. The preliminary opinion, or a reasonable summary, shall be published, at the applicant's expense, for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the proposed appropriation of water is located. At the conclusion of the publication period, the state engineer shall hold a public hearing, at the applicant's expense, in the county where the proposed appropriation is located.</p>
                  <p>(p) In rendering a final opinion, the state engineer shall consider all comments received at the public hearing and those received in writing within twenty (20) days of the public hearing.</p>
                  <p>(q) The state engineer shall render a final opinion and submit it to the legislature within one hundred twenty (120) days of the public hearing. The final opinion shall address all factors set forth in subsection (r) of this section and shall contain a recommendation that the legislature grant or deny the proposed out-of-state use.</p>
                  <p>(r) The legislature shall consider the proposed appropriation following receipt of the state engineer's opinion and recommendation. Notwithstanding subsections (d) through (k) of this section, legislative consent for the proposed appropriation of water for use out of the state shall be based upon consideration of the factors necessary to assure meeting the state's interests in conserving and preserving its water resources for the maximum beneficial use. Factors to be considered by the legislature shall include the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount of water proposed to be appropriated and the proposed uses;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The amount of water available for appropriation from the proposed source, and the natural characteristics of the source;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The economic, social, environmental and other benefits to be derived by the state from the proposed appropriation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The benefits to the state by the use of the water within the state that will be foregone by the proposed appropriation;</p>
                  <p>(v) The benefits presently and prospectively derived from the return flow of water in intrastate use which will be eliminated by the proposed out-of-state use;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The injury to existing water rights of other appropriators that may result from the proposed use;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Whether the use formulated and carried out promotes or enhances the purposes and policies of the state's water development plans and water resources policy, and that the use will not unreasonably interfere with other planned uses or developments for which a permit has been or may be issued;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Whether the proposed use will significantly impair the state's interest and ability to preserve and conserve sufficient quantities of water for reasonably foreseeable consumptive uses and other beneficial uses recognized by law to include but not limited to domestic, livestock, agricultural, municipal and industrial purposes;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Whether the proposed use will adversely affect the quantity or quality of water available for domestic or municipal use;</p>
                  <p>(x) Whether, to the greatest extent possible, the correlation between surface water and groundwater has been determined, to avoid possible harmful effects of the proposed use on the supply of either.</p>
                  <p>(s) Nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with compacts, court decrees and treaty obligations.</p>

                  <p>The application must set forth the name and post office address of the applicant; the source of the water supply; the nature of the proposed use; the location and description of the proposed work; the time within which it is proposed to begin construction, and the time required for the completion of construction. Maps and plans shall conform with the provisions of W.S. 41-4-510. In case of reservoirs where the storage is for stock purposes only and the capacity does not exceed twenty (20) acre-feet and the height of dam does not exceed twenty (20) feet, the state engineer may issue a permit without the filing of a map; however the state engineer may require certain information be submitted on special forms to be furnished or designated by him. Any violation of subsection (a) of this section shall be punishable pursuant to W.S. 41-3-616 with the exception that the owner of any unpermitted reservoir with a capacity of twenty (20) acre-feet or less and a dam height of twenty (20) feet or less shall have forty-five (45) days after receipt of the written notice of violation pursuant to W.S. 41-3-616(a), to submit an application for a permit. The application shall meet the requirements of the state engineer's office. Each day of the forty-five (45) days shall not be counted as a separate violation if the application for a reservoir permit is received during this forty-five (45) day period.</p>
                  <p>(b) For reservoir permits issued in conjunction with the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) for mining operations, the state engineer shall promptly review the application and advise the applicant in writing if it is complete, within thirty (30) days. If the application is complete, or is resubmitted to the satisfaction of the state engineer, it shall be approved or denied within forty-five (45) days of this determination:</p>
                  <p>(i) For the purpose of this subsection "complete" means that the application contains all the essential and necessary elements and is acceptable for further review for substance and compliance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>

                  <p>Whenever the owner, manager or lessee of a reservoir, constructed under the provisions of this act, shall desire the use of the bed of the stream, or other water course, for the purpose of carrying stored or impounded water from the reservoir to the consumer, or shall desire the use of any ditch to carry, convey or transmit any of the stored or impounded water for the benefit of any person having the right to have the reservoir water carried, conveyed or transmitted through the ditch under the laws of this state, he shall, in writing notify the water commissioner of the district in which the stored or impounded water is to be used, giving the date when it is proposed to discharge water from the reservoir, its volume in acre feet and the names of all persons and ditches entitled to its use, and other matters as may be necessary to properly distribute the water. It shall then be the duty of the water commissioner to so adjust the headgates of all ditches of ditch companies or appropriators from the stream or water course, and the division boxes of individual consumers of water, not entitled to the use of the stored water, as will enable those having the right to secure the volume of water to which they are entitled. The commissioner shall not in any other manner interfere with the headgates or division boxes, except as otherwise provided by law. The water commissioner shall keep a true and just account of the time spent by him in the discharge of his duties as defined in this section, and it shall be the duty of the water commissioner or division superintendent to present a bill of one-half (1/2) the expense so incurred to the reservoir owner, manager or lessee, and if the owner, manager, or lessee shall neglect for three (3) days, after the presentation of the bills of costs, to pay the costs, the costs shall be made a charge upon the reservoir and shall be collected as delinquent taxes until the complete payment of the bill of costs has been made. Costs recovered under this section shall be paid into the general fund.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the state engineer believes that inspections carried out under W.S. 41-3-309 are inadequate or that additional inspections are necessary, the state engineer may inspect personally or appoint an assistant engineer to inspect the construction, enlargement, repair, alteration or removal of any dam or diversion system. If after any inspection the state engineer or his representative finds that amendments, modifications or changes are necessary in order to insure the security and integrity of the work and structure, the protection of property or the public safety, the state engineer may order the owner or owners of the dam or diversion system to revise the plans and specifications, or order work stopped. It is unlawful to proceed with or continue the work until any revisions have been approved by the state engineer.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any inspections required by this section shall be made at state expense, provided the assistant engineer performing such inspections is an employee of the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the assistant engineer is not a regular employee of the state of Wyoming, inspections shall be made at the expense of the owner. The owner shall be furnished with an estimate of the cost prior to performance of any inspections, but the state engineer is not precluded from collecting any or all additional costs which result from performance of the inspections. Costs to be paid by the owner shall include, but are not limited to, all work or tests as are necessary to fully provide any information and data required by the state engineer or his appointed representative. If the owner refuses or neglects to turn over the funds within thirty (30) days, after the presentation of the bill of costs, the costs shall constitute a lien upon the works or other properties of the owner or owners and may be collected by appropriate action in any court of competent jurisdiction. In order to have a valid, enforceable lien under this section, a lien statement sworn to before a notarial officer shall be filed by the claimant with the county clerk of the county in which the property is located. The county clerk shall file the statement and index by date, name of claimant and property owner, and by legal description. The lien statement shall contain the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and address of the governing body seeking to enforce the lien;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The name and address of the person against whose property the lien is filed; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The legal description of the property to which the lien attaches.</p>
                  <p>(d) All funds paid by the owner to the state engineer shall be deposited in the state engineer's holding account from which account the costs incurred as a result of any inspections or other work deemed necessary under this section shall be paid. Any funds not so expended shall be returned to the person or persons advancing the funds.</p>

Before ordering an inspection, the state engineer may require any person or persons requesting the inspection to deposit a sum of money sufficient to pay the expenses of the inspection into the state engineer's holding account. If after the inspection the dam, reservoir or diversion system is determined to be in a safe and usable condition, the state engineer may cause the whole or part of the expenses of the inspection to be paid out of the state engineer's holding account. Any excess funds shall be returned to the person or persons advancing the funds.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the dam, reservoir or diversion system is found to be defective, any funds deposited by the person or persons requesting the inspection shall be returned and the state engineer may require the person or persons owning the dam, reservoir or diversion system in question to pay the whole or any part of the expenses of inspection. If the state engineer requires a payment, he shall present a bill of costs to the owner or owners, and if the owner or owners refuse or neglect to pay the costs within thirty (30) days after the presentation of the bill of costs, the costs shall constitute a lien upon the works or other properties of the owner or owners and may be collected by appropriate action in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the inspection discloses defects in the works which in the judgment of the state engineer or his authorized agent constitute a threat to life or property, the state engineer may, without incurring any liability, order the draining of any reservoir involved, or the limitation or cessation of its use or the use of any defective works until such time as the owner of the reservoir or other works returns the works to a safe condition as approved by the state engineer. The lien shall be filed as provided by W.S. 41-3-310(c).</p>

The water user who may have used any water from such reservoir for any particular year shall have the preference as to the use of the same water for the next ensuing year. The state engineer, the water commissioner of the particular district and the water superintendent having jurisdiction over the region of any reservoir, shall together constitute a board of special commissioners, and shall have power, when application is made to them by either party interested, to establish reasonable maximum rates to be charged for the use of water from any reservoir, whether furnished by individuals or a corporation.

No commissioner shall sit upon such board and determine such rate who is employed by one (1) of the applicants or if the relationship of debtor or creditor exists between him and one (1) of the applicants. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to deny the right to store water for use for more than one (1) year.</p>

                  <p>(a) The storage of water by means of a reservoir is a diversion, and the point of diversion is the point defined in the permit where the longitudinal axis of the dam crosses the center of the streambed.</p>
                  <p>(b) A change in point of diversion of a reservoir may be granted pursuant to W.S. 41-3-114 by the state engineer if the water right is unadjudicated, or by the state board of control if the water right has been adjudicated. No petition shall be granted if the rights of other appropriators shall be injuriously affected thereby or if the change is not within the original project concept. In deciding whether to grant or deny a proposed change in point of diversion of a reservoir within the original project concept, the state engineer or the board of control shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) The distance between the old point of diversion and the new point of diversion;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The water administration problems which may be created by granting the change in the point of diversion;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The effect of the petition upon Wyoming's entitlement to water under compacts, court decrees and treaties;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The rights of other appropriators; and</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-401. Failure to use water; extension of time; initiation by benefitted or injured user; hearing; appeal.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Where the holder of an appropriation of water from a surface, underground or reservoir water source fails, either intentionally or unintentionally, to use the water therefrom for the beneficial purposes for which it was appropriated, whether under an adjudicated or unadjudicated right, during any five (5) successive years, he is considered as having abandoned the water right and shall forfeit all water rights and privileges appurtenant thereto. Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, the holder of an appropriation for the diversion and storage of water in a reservoir, from which water or a portion thereof has not yet been beneficially used for the purposes for which appropriated, may apply to the board of control for an extension of time not to exceed five (5) years, within which to use water therefrom for the beneficial purposes for which it was appropriated. In the application the holder shall demonstrate the exercise of due diligence toward the utilization of the appropriation, and that notwithstanding the exercise of due diligence, reasonable cause exists for nonuse. Reasonable cause includes but is not limited to delay due to court or administrative proceedings, time required in planning, developing, financing and constructing projects for the application of stored water to beneficial use which require in excess of five (5) years to complete, delay due to requirement of state and federal statutes and rules and regulations thereunder and any other causes beyond the control of the holder of the appropriation. Upon receipt of an application for extension, the board of control shall proceed under the provisions of W.S. 16-3-101 through 16-3-115 and may grant an extension of time as it finds proper, not to exceed five (5) years, for the application of the appropriated water to the beneficial use for which it was appropriated. A prior grant of extension of time hereunder does not preclude the holder from applying for additional extensions of time, each not to exceed five (5) years, upon similar application and showing. The granting of an extension of time precludes the commencement of an abandonment action against the appropriation during the period of extension.</p>
                  <p>(b) When any water user who might be benefitted by a declaration of abandonment of existing water rights or who might be injured by the reactivation of the water right, desires to bring about a legal declaration of abandonment, he shall present his case in writing to the state board of control. The board has exclusive original jurisdiction in water right abandonment proceedings. The board shall, if the facts so justify, refer the matter to the superintendent of the water division where the abandonment is claimed to have occurred for public hearing. The total absence of water to divert during an irrigation season precludes the inclusion of any such period of nonuse resulting therefrom in the computation of the successive five (5) year period under this section. The following persons have standing to petition the state board of control to declare the abandonment of existing water rights under this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any person who has a valid adjudicated water right or is the holder of a valid permit from the same source of supply which is equal to or junior in date of priority to the right for which abandonment is sought; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The holder of a valid water right entitled to surplus water under W.S. 41-4-318 through 41-4-324, petitioning to abandon a water right from the same source of supply if the right sought to be abandoned has a priority date of March 1, 1945, or earlier.</p>
                  <p>(c) The superintendent shall notify the holders of water rights sought to be abandoned by certified mail that a hearing will be held. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. All notices shall advise interested parties of the time, place and purpose of the hearing. Parties initiating abandonment actions are designated as contestants. Water right holders or other persons with interests in the rights allegedly abandoned are designated as contestees. In any case where notice by certified mail cannot be accomplished an advertisement published once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the abandonment is alleged to have occurred, naming the parties in the case and setting forth the time, place and purpose of the hearing is sufficient. Cost of advertising shall be paid by the contestant.</p>
                  <p>(d) A transcript shall be made of the hearing and delivered to the superintendent. The contestant shall provide and pay for the costs of the record. At the conclusion of the hearing the transcript, all other evidence and the report of the superintendent shall be transmitted to the board by the superintendent. At its next meeting the board shall vote to declare the right in question abandoned, either wholly or partially, or to decline to do so.</p>
                  <p>(e) The board shall enter an order reflecting its action on the abandonment hearing, and shall, within sixty (60) days, send a certified copy of the declaration to each contestant and contestee. Appeals may be taken as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(f) An appropriation for irrigation use is not subject to partial abandonment for failure of the appropriator to irrigate part of the lands described in his permit or certificate of appropriation during the successive five (5) year period if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Facilities to divert the water and to apply it to beneficial use upon the lands which were not irrigated existed in usable form during the period of nonuse; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) There was not a sufficient supply of water available, because of regulation for prior water rights or because shortage of supply resulted in insufficient water to satisfy the appropriation in full, to irrigate the lands for which abandonment is sought provided that a diligent effort was made to use the supply which was available.</p>

                  <p>(a) When any appropriator has failed, intentionally or unintentionally, to use any portion of surface, underground or reservoir water appropriated by him, whether under an adjudicated or unadjudicated right, for a period of five (5) successive years, the state engineer may initiate forfeiture proceedings against the appropriator with the state board of control, to determine the validity of the unused right. The state engineer shall designate the area to be affected by the proceedings, not to contain in area more than one (1) water division. The total absence of water to divert during an irrigation season precludes the inclusion of any period of nonuse resulting therefrom in the computation of the successive five (5) year period. The secretary of the board shall refer the matter for a hearing to the superintendent of the water division where the forfeiture is alleged to have occurred. This section does not apply to any reservoir for which an extension has been granted during the period of extension under W.S. 41-3-401(a).</p>
                  <p>(b) The superintendent shall send notices, by certified mail, of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing to all owners of lands covered by the appropriations involved in the forfeiture proceeding. Such persons shall be joined as parties to the forfeiture proceedings as contestees. The state shall be designated as contestant. In a case where notice by certified mail cannot be accomplished, an advertisement published once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the forfeiture is alleged to have occurred, naming the parties in the case and setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, and a general description of the water rights whose status is under consideration, shall answer the requirements of notice. Notice by certified mail shall first be attempted before notice by advertisement is employed. Advertisement costs shall be paid by the state engineer. In addition, whenever it appears necessary for full and proper notice, the superintendent may post a notice of the hearing in a conspicuous place on the land or at the place where the water rights are attached or utilized, or on the point of diversion.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any use of a contested water right, easement, privilege, or portion thereof, by the water user, his lessees, agents, transferees or assignees on or after the date of the notice shall be inadmissible as evidence of beneficial use in all hearings or appeals arising out of the alleged forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>(d) A transcript shall be made of the hearing. The record shall be delivered to the superintendent. The state engineer shall provide and pay for the costs of such record. At the conclusion of the hearing, the transcript, all other evidence, and the report of the superintendent shall be transmitted to the board of control by the superintendent. At its next meeting, the board shall vote by secret written ballot to declare the right in question forfeited or to decline to do so. Any forfeiture requires three (3) affirmative votes by the board.</p>
                  <p>(e) Whenever the state engineer has initiated forfeiture proceedings, he shall not participate as a voting member of the board of control in any determination of whether any water right, easement, or privilege is to be forfeited, all other laws to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
                  <p>(f) Such proceedings shall not be initiated by the state engineer after the use of a water right, easement or privilege has occurred.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any time within two (2) years after the date the board has entered an order forfeiting a water right, any person who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board by written petition, proof, or affidavits, that he was an owner, lessee or beneficiary of the forfeited right, that he had no actual or constructive notice of the forfeiture hearings, and that he has been damaged thereby, may require the board to reopen the case for a determination of whether such right shall remain forfeited or be reactivated without loss of priority.</p>
                  <p>(h) Whenever the board has declared any water right forfeited, it shall send a certified copy of the declaration to each contestee within sixty (60) days. Such party may within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing, appeal to the district court of the district wherein the hearing was originally held or in the district court of Laramie county.</p>
                  <p>(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow the state engineer to initiate forfeiture proceedings against water rights which are being put to beneficial use, wholly or in part.</p>

                  <p>(a) To bring about a more economical use of the available water supply, it is lawful for water users owning lands to which are attached water rights, to rotate in the use of supply to which they may be collectively entitled, or a single water user, having lands to which water rights of a different priority attach, may in like manner rotate in use, provided that all water rights subject to rotation are in priority. Rotation of water will be allowed only if it can be accomplished without injury to other appropriators.</p>
                  <p>(b) Prior to the commencement of any rotation in the use of water pursuant to this section, the owner or owners of the water rights to be rotated shall file a notice of intention to rotate with the appropriate water commissioner, on the form provided for that purpose by the commissioner, and shall obtain the water commissioner's written approval which shall be endorsed on the form.</p>
                  <p>(c) Performance of the rotation shall be enforced by the water commissioner in accordance with the terms and conditions included in the form signed and approved by the water commissioner.

Said territory need not be contiguous, provided it is so situated that the organization of a single district of the territory described is calculated to promote one (1) or more of the purposes enumerated in W.S. 41-3-720;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The assessed value of all irrigated land within the boundaries of the proposed district;</p>
                  <p>(v) A general designation of divisions of the district and the number of directors of the district proposed for each subdivision;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Said petition shall pray for the organization of the district by the name proposed.</p>
                  <p>(e) No petition with the requisite signatures shall be declared null and void on account of alleged defects, but the court may at any time permit the petition to be amended to conform to the facts by correcting any errors in the description of the territory, or in any other particular. However, similar petitions or duplicate copies of the same petition for the organization of the same district may be filed and shall together be regarded as one (1) petition. All such petitions filed prior to the hearing on the first petition filed, shall be considered by the court the same as though filed with the first petition placed on file.</p>
                  <p>(f) In determining whether the requisite number of landowners have signed the petition, the court shall be governed by the names as they appear upon the assessment records which shall be prima facie evidence of such ownership.</p>

                  <p>(a) Immediately after the filing of such petition, the court wherein such petition is filed or a judge thereof in vacation, shall by order fix a place and time, not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days after the petition is filed, for hearing thereon and thereupon the clerk of said court shall cause notice by publication to be made of the pendency of the petition and of the time and place of hearing thereon; the clerk of said court shall also forthwith cause a copy of said notice to be mailed by U.S. registered mail to the board of county commissioners of each of the several counties having territory within the proposed district. At the same time, and in the same manner, the clerk of said court aforesaid shall forward to the state engineer, at his office in the capital, a copy of the notice of hearing, and a certified copy of such petition.</p>
                  <p>(b) The district court in and for the county in which the petition for the organization of a water conservancy district has been filed, shall thereafter for all purposes of this act, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, maintain and have original and exclusive jurisdiction, coextensive with the boundaries of said water conservancy district, and of land and other property proposed to be included in said district or affected by said district without regard to the usual limits of its jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(c) The state engineer, in his official capacity, upon the filing of the petition for the organization of a water conservancy district, shall become an interested party in all court proceedings thereafter involving the validity, or invalidity, of such petition, and he shall have the right to participate as a party in all such proceedings either in person, by counsel, or both. Not later than ten (10) days prior to the date fixed by the court for the hearing on the pending petition, the state engineer shall file a formal answer in the proceedings, with copies of his answer to the attorneys representing the sponsors of the petition, in which said answer the state engineer shall indicate his approval, or disapproval, of said petition, or any part or parts thereof. If the state engineer disapproves the petition or any part or parts thereof, he shall set forth in detail in his answer his reasons for the disapproval. No replication, or other pleading, by the sponsors of the petition, to the answer of the state engineer, shall be permitted; but such sponsors at the hearing on the petition will be permitted to offer whatever material testimony or evidence they desire to present to the court with respect to the answer of the state engineer. The district judge who has jurisdiction over the proceedings may, in his discretion, request, or subpoena, the state engineer to appear as a witness in support of the answer filed by the state engineer.</p>
                  <p>(d) No judge of such court wherein such petition is filed shall be disqualified to perform any duty imposed by this act by reason of ownership of property within any water conservancy district or proposed water conservancy district, or by reason of ownership of any property that may be benefited, taxed or assessed therein.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-724. Protesting creation.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) At any time after the filing of a petition for the organization of a conservancy district, and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the time fixed by the order of court for the hearing upon said petition, and not thereafter, a petition may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court wherein the proceeding for the creation of said district is pending, signed by not fewer than twenty percent (20%) of the owners of or entrymen on the irrigated lands, or lands susceptible of irrigation under the works proposed for construction, to be included in said proposed district, but not embraced within the incorporated limits of a city or town, who have not signed the petition for creating such district, and each tract (or tracts), of land shall be listed opposite the name of the signer, each such tract (or tracts), together with the improvements thereon, to have an assessed valuation of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and also signed by not fewer than five percent (5%) of owners of nonirrigated lands and/or lands embraced in the incorporated limits of a city or town, all situated in the proposed district who have not signed the petition for creating such district, and each tract (or tracts) of land shall be listed opposite the name of the signer, each such tract (or tracts), together with improvements thereon, to have an assessed valuation of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), protesting the creating of said district. The signers of said protesting petition shall state therein the land owned by each, and shall also state the value thereof as shown by the last preceding assessment.</p>
                  <p>(b) In the event a petitioner shall sign such petition both as owner of irrigated or irrigable and nonirrigated land or lands situated within a municipality his name shall be counted only as an owner of irrigated or irrigable lands.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon the filing of such protesting petition, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the court forthwith to make as many certified copies thereof, including the signatures thereto, as there are counties in which any part of said proposed district extends, and forthwith to place in the hands of the county assessor of each of such counties one (1) of said certified copies; and likewise, one (1) of said certified copies shall be forwarded promptly to the state engineer at his office in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Thereupon it shall be the duty of each of such county assessors to determine from the assessment records of his county in his hands, and to certify to the said district court under his official seal, prior to the day fixed for the hearing as aforesaid, the total assessed valuation of the several tracts of land listed in the protest, situated in said proposed district within his county. Upon the day set for the hearing upon the original petition, if it shall appear to the court from such certificate, or certificates, and from such other evidence as may be adduced by any party in interest, that said protesting petition is not signed by the requisite number of owners of lands and of the requisite value as herein set forth, the court shall thereupon dismiss said protesting petition and shall proceed with the original hearing as in this section provided.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the court shall find from the evidence that said protesting petition is signed by the requisite number of owners of lands, and of the requisite values, the court shall forthwith dismiss the original petition praying for the creation of the district. The finding of the court upon the question of such total valuation, the genuineness of the signatures, and all matters of law and fact incident to such determination shall be final and conclusive on all parties in interest whether appearing or not.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any owner, whether individual or corporate, of real property in said proposed district not having individually signed a petition for the organization of a conservancy district, and desiring to object to the organization and incorporation of said district, may, on or before the date set for the cause to be heard, file objection to the organization and incorporation of the district.</p>
                  <p>(f) Such objection shall be limited to a denial of the statements in the petition and shall be heard by the court as an advanced case without unnecessary delay.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon the said hearing, if it shall appear that a petition for the organization of a water conservancy district has been signed and presented, as hereinabove provided, in conformity with this act and that the allegations of the petition are true, and that no protesting petition has been filed, or if filed has been dismissed as hereinabove provided, and the state engineer has not objected to the petition or any part thereof, or his objections have not been sustained, the court shall, by order duly entered of record, adjudicate all questions of jurisdiction, declare the district organized and give it a corporate name, by which in all proceedings it shall thereafter be known, and thereupon the district shall be a political subdivision of the state of Wyoming and a body corporate with all the powers of a public or municipal corporation.</p>
                  <p>(h) In such decree the court shall designate the place where the office or principal place of business of the district shall be located, which shall be within the corporate limits of the district, and which may be changed by order of court from time to time. The regular meetings of the board shall be held at such office or place of business, but for cause may be adjourned to any convenient place. The official records and files of the district shall be kept at the office so established.</p>
                  <p>(j) If the court finds that no petition has been signed and presented in conformity with this act, or that the material facts are not as set forth in the petition filed, it shall dismiss said proceedings and adjudge the costs against the signers of the petition in such proportion as it shall deem just and equitable. No appeal or writ of error shall lie from an order dismissing the said proceeding; but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the filing of a subsequent petition or petitions for similar improvements or for a similar water conservancy district, and the right so to renew such proceeding is hereby expressly granted and authorized.</p>
                  <p>(k) If an order be entered establishing the district, such order shall be deemed final and no appeal or writ of error shall lie therefrom, and the entry of such order shall finally and conclusively establish the regular organization of said district against all persons except the state of Wyoming, in an action in the nature of a writ of quo warranto, commenced by the attorney general within three (3) months after said decree declaring such district organized as herein provided, and not otherwise. The organization of said district shall not be directly nor collaterally questioned in any suit, action or proceeding except as herein expressly authorized.</p>

The same shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state in the same manner as articles of incorporation are now required to be filed under the general laws concerning corporations, and copies shall also be filed in the office of the county clerk and recorder of each county in which a part of the district may be, where they shall become permanent records; and the clerk and recorder in each county, and the secretary of state, shall receive for filing said copies such fees as now are or hereafter may be provided by law for like services in similar cases.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-726. Procedure for organizing subdistricts.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Subdistricts may be organized upon the petition of the owner of real property, within or partly within and partly without the district, which petition shall fulfill the same requirements concerning the subdistricts as the petition outlined in W.S. 41-3-721 is required to fulfill, concerning the organization of the main district and shall be filed with the clerk of the court, and shall be accompanied by a bond as provided for in W.S. 41-3-722. All proceedings relating to the organization of such subdistricts shall conform in all things to the provision of this act relating to the organization of districts; provided, that not more than a majority of the owners of lands, having one-half or more of the aggregate assessed value of the lands in the proposed subdistrict, shall be required to sign the petition for the creation of a subdistrict, and not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the owners of lands in the proposed subdistrict shall be required to sign the protesting petition against the creation of such subdistrict. Whenever the court shall by its order duly entered of record, declare the [or] decree such subdistricts to be organized, the clerk of said court shall thereupon give notice of such order to the directors of the district who shall thereupon act also as directors of the subdistrict. Thereafter, the proceedings in reference to the subdistrict shall in all matters conform to the provision of this act except that in the appraisal of benefits for the purpose of such subdistricts, in the issuance of bonds, in levying of assessments and in all other matters affecting only the subdistrict, the provisions of this act shall apply to the subdistrict as though it were an independent district, and it shall not in these things be amalgamated with the main district. The said petition for organization of a subdistrict shall also contain a statement of the amount or quantity of water for which said subdistrict desires to acquire the perpetual use and the amount of money that said subdistrict is willing to pay therefor, and the court shall, prior to the entry of its decree organizing any territory into a subdistrict obtain the verified consent of the board to furnish such perpetual use of water for the purposes therein specified to such subdistrict at a price and upon the terms mentioned in the petition, then the court shall be authorized to enter its decree of organization of such subdistrict.</p>

                  <p>(a) Within thirty (30) days after entering the decree incorporating said district, the court shall appoint a board of directors of the district consisting of not less than five (5) or more than nine (9) persons who are residents of the county or counties in which the water conservancy district is situated, all of whom shall be owners of real property in said district. The terms of office of said directors shall be staggered over a five (5) year period, but not more than two (2) of such directors may be appointed for a full five (5) year term.</p>
                  <p>(b) At the expiration of their respective terms of office as fixed by the court, their successors in office shall be elected in the manner provided for the election of irrigation district commissioners in W.S. 41-7-103, 41-7-104 and 41-7-316 through 41-7-318, as amended, or as may be amended by the legislature of Wyoming hereafter, except that they shall be elected for a term of five (5) years. The court shall fill all vacancies which may occur at any time on said board, but such court appointees shall only serve until the next succeeding regular election for board members. Each director shall hold office during the term for which he is appointed or elected, and until his successor is duly appointed or elected, and has qualified; and shall furnish a corporate surety bond at the expense of the district; in amount and form fixed and approved by the court, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties as such director.</p>

Such board shall adopt a seal and shall keep in a well-bound book a record of all of its proceedings, minutes of all meetings, certificates, contracts, bonds given by employees and all corporate acts which shall be open to inspection of all owners of property within the district, as well as to all other interested parties.</p>

                  <p>(i) To have perpetual succession;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To take by appropriation, grant, purchase, bequest, devise or lease, and to hold and enjoy water, water works, water rights and sources of water supply; and any and all real and personal property of any kind within or without the district necessary or convenient to the full exercise of its powers; and to sell, lease, encumber, alien or otherwise, dispose of water, water works, water rights and sources of water supply for use within the district, and any and all real and personal property of any kind within or without the district; also to acquire, construct or operate, control and use any and all works, facilities and means necessary or convenient to the exercise of its power, both within and without the district for the purpose of providing for the use of such water within the district and to do and perform any and all things necessary or convenient to the full exercise of the power herein granted. Title to all rights and property acquired by any water conservancy district organized under this act shall immediately and by operation of law vest in such district in its corporate name; such property shall be held for the uses and purposes of the district, and shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal, school, and other taxes imposed by any taxing authority of the state of Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To have and to exercise the power of eminent domain and in the manner provided by law for the condemnation of private property for public use to take any property necessary to the exercise of the powers herein granted;</p>
                  <p>(iv) To construct and maintain works and establish and maintain facilities across or along any public street or highway, and in, upon, or over any vacant state lands which lands are now, or may become, the property of the state of Wyoming and to construct works and establish and maintain facilities across any stream of water or water course; providing, however, that the district shall promptly restore any such street or highway to its former state of usefulness as nearly as may be, and shall not use the same in such manner as to completely or unnecessarily impair the usefulness thereof. The grant of the right to use such vacant lands shall be effective upon the filing by such district with the state board of land commissioners of an application showing the boundaries, extent and locations of the lands, rights-of-way, or easements desired for such purposes. If the land, rights-of-way or easements for which application shall be made is for the construction of any aqueduct, ditch, pipeline, conduit, drains, tunnel, or other works for the conveyance of water, or for roads, or for poles or towers, and wires for the conveyance of electrical energy or for telephonic or telegraphic communication no compensation shall be charged the district therefor, unless in the opinion of the state board of land commissioners the construction of such works will render the remainder of the legal subdivision through which such works are to be constructed valueless or unsaleable, in which event the district shall pay for the lands to be taken and for such portion of any legal subdivision which in the opinion of the board is rendered valueless or unsaleable, at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per acre. If the lands for which application is made are for the purposes other than the construction of roads or works for the conveyance of water, or electricity or telephonic or telegraphic communication, such district shall pay to the state for such lands at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per acre. Upon filing such application, accompanied by map or plat showing the location or proposed location of such works and/or facilities, the fee title to so much of such state lands as shall be necessary or convenient to enable such district efficiently and without interference to construct, maintain and operate its works and to establish, maintain and operate its facilities, shall be conveyed to said district by patent. If an easement for right-of-way only over such lands be sought by the district, such easement or right-of-way shall be evidenced by permit or grant executed by or on behalf of the state board of land commissioners. The state board of land commissioners may reserve easements and/or rights-of-way, in the public, across any lands in such patents, grants or permits described for streets, roads and highways theretofore established according to law. Before any such patent, grant or permit shall be executed, any compensation due to the state under the provisions hereof, must be paid. No fee shall be exacted from the district for any patent, permit or grant so issued or for any service rendered hereunder. In the use of streets, the district shall be subject to the reasonable rules and regulations of the county, city or town where such streets lie, concerning excavation and the refilling of excavation, the relaying of pavements and the protection of the public during periods of construction; provided, that the district shall not be required to pay any license or permit fees, or file any bonds. The district may be required to pay reasonable inspection fees;</p>
                  <p>(v) To contract with the government of the United States or any agency thereof or with an agency of the state of Wyoming for the construction, preservation, operation and maintenance of water supply works, drains, pipelines, tunnels, reservoirs, regulating basins, diversion canals and works, dams, power plants and all necessary works incidental thereto, including supply canals, farm laterals, and distribution and drainage systems of all kinds, and to acquire perpetual rights to the use of water from such works, to sell and dispose of perpetual rights to the use of water from such works to persons and corporations, public and private;</p>
                  <p>(vi) To list in separate ownership the lands within the district which are susceptible of irrigation from district sources and to make an allotment of water to all such lands, which allotment of water shall not exceed the maximum amount of water that the board determines could be beneficially used on such lands; to levy assessments as hereinafter provided, against the lands within the district to which water is allotted on the basis of the value per acre-foot of water allotted to said lands within the district; provided, that the board may divide the district into units and fix a different value per acre-foot of water in the respective units, with due regard to land classification, and in such case shall assess the lands within each unit upon the same basis of value per acre-foot of water allotted to land within such unit;</p>
                  <p>(vii) To fix rates at which water not allotted to lands as hereinbefore provided shall be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of; provided, however, that rates shall be equitable although not necessarily equal or uniform, for like classes of service throughout the district;</p>
                  <p>(viii) To enter into contracts, employ and retain personal services and employ laborers; to create, establish and maintain such offices and positions as shall be necessary and convenient for the transaction of the business of the district; and to elect, appoint and employ such officers, attorneys, agents and employees therefor as shall be found by the board to be necessary and convenient;</p>

Upon such assent, any lands excluded from the district shall upon order of the court be discharged from all liens in favor of the United States under the contract with the United States or under bonds deposited with its agents. Upon allowance of such petition, the board shall file a certified copy of the order of the board making such change with the clerk of the court and upon order of the court said lands shall be excluded from the district.</p>

                  <p>The board may, in its discretion, at any time file a petition in the court, praying a judicial examination and determination of any power conferred hereby or by any amendment hereto or of any tax or assessment levied or of any act, proceeding or contract of the district, whether or not said contract shall have been executed, including proposed contracts for the acquisition, construction, maintenance and/or operation of works for the district. Such petition shall set forth the facts whereon the validity of such power, assessment, act, proceeding or contract is founded and shall be verified by the president of the board. Notice of the filing of said petition shall be given by the clerk of the court, under the seal thereof, stating in brief outline the contents of the petition and showing where a full copy of any contract or contracts, therein mentioned, may be examined. Said notice shall be served by publication in at least five (5) consecutive issues of a weekly newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the principal office of the district is located, and by posting the same in the office of the district at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed in said notice for the hearing on said petition. Any owner of property in the district or person interested in the contract or proposed contract may appear and demur to or answer said petition at any time prior to the date fixed for said hearing or within such further time as may be allowed by the court; and the petition shall be taken as confessed by all persons who fail so to appear. The said petition and notice shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction and upon hearing, the court shall examine into and determine all matters and things affecting the question submitted, shall make such findings, with reference thereto, and render such judgment and decree thereon as the case warrants. Costs may be divided or apportioned among the contesting parties in the discretion of the trial court. Review of the judgment of the court may be had as in other similar cases, except that such review must be applied for within thirty (30) days after the time of the rendition of such judgment, or within such additional time as may be allowed by the court within thirty (30) days. The Code of Civil Procedure shall govern in matters of pleading and practice where not otherwise specified herein. The court shall disregard any error, irregularity or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.</p>

                  <p>To levy and collect taxes under class A as provided in W.S. 41-3-770, the board shall, in each year, determine the amount of money necessary to be raised by taxation, taking into consideration other sources of revenue of the district, and shall fix a rate of levy which when levied upon every dollar of assessed valuation of property within the district, and with other revenues will raise the amount required by the district, to supply funds for paying expenses of organization, for surveys and plans, paying the costs of construction, operating and maintaining the works of the district; provided, however, that said rate shall not exceed one-half (1/2) mill on the dollar, prior to the delivery of water from the works, and thereafter not to exceed one (1) mill on the dollar, of assessed valuation of the property within the district, except in the event of accruing defaults and/or deficiencies where an additional levy may be made as provided in W.S. 41-3-775.

Upon receipt by the board of county commissioners of each county, wherein such municipality is located, of a certified copy of such resolution showing the tax rate to be applied to all property in each municipality and showing the municipalities and the property which is exempt therefrom, if any, it shall be the duty of the county officers to levy and collect such tax in addition to such other tax as may be levied by such board of county commissioners at the rate so fixed and determined.</p>

Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county and such county assessor shall extend the amount of such special assessment, plus said operating and maintenance charges, on the tax roll as a special assessment against the lands upon which said special assessment is made. If a subdistrict or subdistricts are organized as herein provided, assessments of special benefits shall be made, spread on the tax rolls and collected in the same manner provided in the case of irrigation districts. A district may elect to establish the special assessment, operating and maintenance amount and due date after the third Monday of July and on or before the third Monday of October, provided the district shall be responsible for the billing and collection of special assessments, operating and maintenance charges.</p>

                  <p>(a) Prior to the third Monday in July of each year in which assessments are made, the board shall appoint a time and place or places where it will meet within the district for the purposes of hearing objections to assessments and prior notice of such hearing shall be given by publication in two (2) issues a week apart, in some newspaper of general circulation published in each county; provided that if there is any county in the district in which there is no newspaper published, then such notice shall be published in an adjoining county. Said notice shall notify the owners of property in the district that in the secretary's office may be found and examined a description of the property so assessed, the amount of the assessment thereon fixed by the board, and the time and place or places fixed by the board for the hearing of objections to such assessments. It shall not be necessary for said notice to contain separate descriptions of the lots or tracts of real estate, but it shall be sufficient if the notice shall contain such descriptions as will inform the owner whether or not his real estate is covered by such descriptions, and to inform the owners where can be found of record the amount of assessments. If in the opinion of any person whose property is assessed, his property has been assessed too high, or has been erroneously or illegally assessed, he may at any time before the date of such hearing, file written objections to such assessments, stating the grounds of such objections, which statement shall be verified by the affidavit of said person or his agent. In such hearing the board shall hear such evidence and arguments as may be offered concerning the correctness or legality of such assessment and may modify or amend the same. Any owner of property desiring to appeal from the findings of the board as to assessment shall, within thirty (30) days from the finding of the board, file with the clerk of the court a written notice making demand for trial by the court. The appellant at the same time shall file a bond with good and sufficient security to be approved by the clerk of said court in the sum not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00) to the effect that if the finding of the court be not more favorable to the appellant than the finding of the board, the appellant will pay the cost of the appeal. The appellant shall state definitely from what part of the order the appeal is taken. In case more than one (1) appeal is taken, the court may upon its showing that the same may be consolidated without injury to the interests of any one, consolidate and try the same together.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court shall not disturb the findings of the board unless the findings of the board in any case are manifestly disproportionate to the assessments imposed upon other property in the district created under this act. The trial shall be to the court and the matter shall take precedence before the court and shall be taken up as promptly as may be after the appeal is filed. If no appeal is taken from the findings of the board within the time prescribed in this section, or after the finding of the court in case an appeal is taken from the findings of the board, then the assessment shall be final and conclusive evidence that said assessments have been made in proportion to the benefits conferred upon the property in said district by reason of the improvements to be constructed under the provisions of this act and such assessments shall constitute a perpetual lien upon such property so assessed until paid.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-911. Authority to order interfering appropriator to cease withdrawals of water; hearing complaints by appropriators.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Whenever a well withdrawing water for beneficial purposes shall interfere unreasonably with an adequate well developed solely for domestic or stock uses as defined in W.S. 41-3-907, whether in a control area or not, the state engineer may, on complaint of the operator of the stock or domestic well, order the interfering appropriator to cease or reduce withdrawals of underground water, unless such appropriator shall furnish at his own expense, sufficient water at the former place of use to meet the need for domestic or stock use. In case of interference between two (2) wells utilizing water for stock or domestic use as defined in W.S. 41-3-907, the appropriation with the earliest priority shall have the better right.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any appropriator of either surface or underground water may file a written complaint alleging interference with his water right by a junior right. Complaints are to be filed with the state engineer and are to be accompanied by a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to help defray costs of investigation. This section is not applicable to interference between two (2) surface water rights. Upon receiving the complaint and fee, the state engineer shall undertake an investigation to determine if the alleged interference does exist. Following the investigation, the state engineer shall issue a report to all interested parties stating his findings. The report may suggest various means of stopping, rectifying or ameliorating the interference or damage caused thereby.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any interested appropriator who is dissatisfied with the results of the foregoing procedure may proceed under the applicable provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. If a hearing is to be held, it shall be held before the appropriate water division superintendent. The superintendent shall report to the board of control at its next meeting. The board shall issue its order to include findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-912. Control areas; board member districts; designation; redesignation; duty of state engineer; hearings.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) "Control area" means any underground water district or subdistrict that has been so designated by the board of control. The board of control may designate a control area for the following reasons:</p>
                  <p>(i) The use of underground water is approaching a use equal to the current recharge rate;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ground water levels are declining or have declined excessively;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Conflicts between users are occurring or are foreseeable;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The waste of water is occurring or may occur; or</p>
                  <p>(v) Other conditions exist or may arise that require regulation for the protection of the public interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) Whenever the engineer has information leading him to believe that any underground water district or subdistrict should become a control area, he shall immediately report in writing to the board of control all information known by him with reference to said area.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board of control shall fix a time and place to consider the information supplied by the state engineer and hear any other evidence presented at the time of the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of control shall issue an order declaring that the area in question is or is not to be a control area. If the board determines that a control area needs to be created, it shall define the area geographically and stratigraphically. The board of control may designate five (5) board member districts for the purpose of the election of the control area advisory board.</p>
                  <p>(d) On the petition of five (5) persons owning or entitled by public land filing to the possession of land within the control area, or upon the recommendation of the state engineer, the board of control may consider the redesignation of the geographic or stratigraphic boundaries of a control area. If redesignation is considered, the board shall fix a time and place to hear the information supplied by the petitioners, the state engineer or other interested persons. Within ninety (90) days of the hearing, the board shall issue its order. If a control area is redesignated geographically, the board shall determine whether to divide the area into board member districts pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) On the petition of five (5) persons owning or entitled by public land filing to the possession of land within the control area, the control area advisory board shall consider the designation or redesignation of board member districts. If the control area advisory board determines that board member districts should be designated or redesignated, it shall submit its recommendation to the board of control for approval.</p>
                  <p>(f) The action of the board of control in denying at any time a petition or recommendation for redesignation is final and not subject to review.</p>
                  <p>(g) Whenever a control area has been designated or redesignated the state engineer may, without hearings or other proceedings, refuse to grant permits for the drilling of any wells within the control area.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-913. Control areas; election of control area advisory board; mileage and expense allowances.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) When an underground water district or subdistrict is declared to be a control area, when the board of control geographically redesignates a control area or when the board of control approves the recommendation of a control area advisory board that board member districts be designated or redesignated, a control area advisory board shall be created in the manner provided herein. The control area advisory board shall consist of five (5) adults who own land or underground water rights, or who are the officers, officials or members of the board of a corporation which owns land or underground water rights within the control area. The board shall represent the entire control area.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state engineer shall notify the division advisory committee of the division in which the control area is located, of the designation or redesignation of the control area. Within twenty (20) days of notification, the division advisory committee shall select a nominating committee of not less than three (3) persons entitled to vote in the election of the control area advisory board. The nominating committee shall nominate not less than five (5) persons for election to the control area advisory board or, if board member districts have been established, it shall nominate at least one (1) person for election in each district. Within thirty (30) days of its selection, the nominating committee shall report its nominations to the division advisory committee. The division advisory committee shall call an election of members of the control area advisory board, to be held within forty (40) days from the date of the report. The call of the election shall state the time, the place within the control area, the purpose of the election, and the names of persons nominated for election. It shall be published for two (2) consecutive weeks at least twenty (20) days prior to the election in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which a part of the control area or board member district lies.</p>
                  <p>(c) Every person or corporation owning or, by virtue of public land filing, entitled to possession of land which is a part of the control area is entitled to cast for each member to be elected one (1) vote for each acre of such land as assessed upon the last annual assessment roll of the county in which the land is located, or as shown by the public land filing. A person owning a tract of land of less than one (1) acre is entitled to cast one (1) vote for each member to be elected. The grantee or assignee of the water in or under any described land is entitled to vote, as prescribed herein, in the place of the person or corporation owning or entitled to the possession of the land. However, if board member districts are established, only the votes which derive from within each district shall be cast in the election of the district board member.</p>
                  <p>(d) At the hour and place of the election the division advisory committee shall call the roll of those entitled to vote, and the number of votes each is entitled to. They shall make a record of the qualified voters present, receive all proxies and prescribe the method of canvassing the votes. All proxies shall be in writing and signed by the person entitled to vote. The five (5) persons receiving the highest number of votes, or the person receiving the highest number of votes within each board member district, shall be declared to be elected, regardless of whether or not they have received a majority of votes cast. No election shall be invalid because a majority of the acreage of the control area or board member district was not represented at the election. Two (2) of the members so elected shall serve until one (1) year from the third Tuesday in July of the year following the election, and three (3) of the members so elected shall serve until two (2) years following such date. The division advisory committee shall decide by lot which members shall serve for these terms.</p>
                  <p>(e) During the first fifteen (15) days of July next preceding the expiration of the term of any member an election shall be held to elect members of the control area advisory board. The control area advisory board shall call and conduct the election in the same manner prescribed for the first election. Members elected at any election after the first election shall serve for a term of four (4) years. Whenever the office of any member becomes vacant for any cause, a person to fill the vacancy of the unexpired term shall be appointed by the remaining members. The costs of elections shall be paid by the state engineer's office.</p>
                  <p>(f) Each member of the control area advisory board shall receive the same per diem, mileage and expense allowances while attending and traveling to and from meetings of the board and other official business of the board in the same manner and amount as employees of the state. No person shall represent more than one (1) board member district during any term of office, and no person shall serve on a control area advisory board for more than two (2) consecutive terms.</p>

                  <p>(a) After the boundaries of any control area have been determined by the board, the appropriate superintendent shall proceed with the adjudication of unadjudicated wells within the control area. After completing the adjudication, the superintendent shall hold evidence of the adjudication open for inspection by the public at a time and place to be fixed by the superintendent, and notice thereof shall be published in two (2) issues of a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties where the control area is situated.</p>
                  <p>(b) If any well owner, lessee or user within a control area refuses to adjudicate a well, or supply the necessary information to permit adjudication of any well, the superintendent may tag and lock the pump or well to prevent use of water therefrom. The penalty for interfering with the tag or lock on a well is as provided in W.S. 41-3-616. The use of water from a well so tagged and locked is prima facie evidence that the well owner, lessee or user has violated the provisions of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The taking of proof, filing objections or contests, giving notices, conducting of hearings, making adjudications of water rights, determining of priorities as between appropriators, issuing of certificate of appropriation, and taking appeals shall, insofar as applicable, and not in conflict with the provisions of this act be governed by the provisions of W.S. 41-4-101 through 41-4-207 and 41-4-211 through 41-4-517.</p>
                  <p>(d) At the first regular meeting of the board after completion of such proof and advertisement, the board shall cause to be entered in the records of its office an order showing the priorities of right to the use of water in the control area, the amount of appropriation of the parties claiming water therefrom, the character and kind of use for which the appropriation is made, and the places or points of use. The secretary of the board shall issue to each person represented in the determination, a certificate of appropriation signed by the president of the board and attested under seal of the secretary of the board which shall state the name and post-office address of the appropriator, the priority date of the appropriation, the amount of water appropriated, the use to which the water has been applied and, if the appropriation is for irrigation, a description of the legal subdivision of land to which the water is applied, or the place of use if the appropriation is not being used for irrigation. The certificate shall be transmitted by certified mail to the county clerk of the county in which the appropriation has been made and the county clerk shall, upon receipt of the proper fee, record the same and thereupon immediately transmit the certificate to the appropriator. At the time of the submission of final proof of appropriation before the state engineer or superintendent of a water division, a fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be collected, which shall be used for advertising the proof of appropriation and recording the certificate. The priority of appropriation shall be the determining factor in adjudicating underground water; the person first making the appropriation being first entitled to the use of the underground water, except as modified by W.S. 41-3-933.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-3-915. Control areas; hearing to determine adequacy of water for all appropriators; corrective controls generally; agreements in lieu of controls.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) After designation of an area as a control area by the board, the state engineer may temporarily adopt any of the corrective controls provided for by this section, where it appears that immediate regulation is required. After the well adjudication procedure has been completed, the state engineer may, on his own motion, and shall on the petition of twenty (20) appropriators or of one-tenth of the appropriators of water from a control area, cause a hearing to be held before the state engineer and the control area advisory board to determine whether the underground water in the area is adequate for the needs of all appropriators of underground water in such area. Public notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published once in a newspaper circulated in the area not more than thirty (30) days before the time set for the meeting. If the state engineer finds after the hearing, and after receiving the advice of the control area advisory board, that the underground water in the control area is insufficient for all of the appropriators, he may by order adopt one (1) or more of the following corrective controls:</p>
                  <p>(i) He may close the controlled area to any further appropriation of underground water, in which event he shall thereafter refuse to grant any applications for a permit to appropriate underground water in that area, provided, that such area may be reopened to appropriations at any time the state engineer shall find on the basis of additional evidence that there is unappropriated water in the area, in which event the state engineer shall reconsider all applications for permits refused on the grounds of the order closing the area;</p>
                  <p>(ii) He may determine the permissible total withdrawal of underground water in the control area for each day, month or year, and, insofar as may be reasonably done, he shall apportion such permissible total withdrawal among the appropriators holding valid rights to the underground water in the control area in accordance with the relative dates of priority of such rights;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If he finds that withdrawals by junior appropriators have a material and adverse effect upon the supply available for and needed by senior appropriators, he may order such junior appropriators to cease or reduce withdrawals forthwith;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If he finds that cessation or reduction of withdrawals by junior appropriators will not result in proportionate benefits to senior appropriators, he may require and specify a system of rotation of use of underground water in the controlled area;</p>
                  <p>(v) He may institute well spacing requirements if permits are granted to develop new wells.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state engineer shall cause a copy of any such order to be served upon each person affected thereby in the manner provided for service of process in civil actions.</p>
                  <p>(c) Appropriators of underground water from a control area may agree to any method or scheme of control of withdrawals, well spacing, apportionment, rotation or proration of the common supply of underground water. The state engineer shall encourage and promote such agreements and supply the parties with information and advice. When the state engineer, with the advice of the control area advisory board, shall find that any such agreement, executed in writing and filed in his office, is consistent with the intent, purposes and requirements of this act, and would not be detrimental to the public interest or to the rights of other persons not parties to the agreement, he shall approve the agreement, and thereafter such agreement shall control, until terminated as hereinafter provided, in lieu of any order issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any agreement approved by the state engineer may be terminated by the terms of the agreement, by the consent of the parties, or by order of the state engineer if he finds, after investigation and a public hearing before the control area advisory board, held at least two (2) weeks after one (1) published notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which a part of the control area lies, that the agreement is not being substantially complied with by the parties, or that changed conditions have made the agreement inequitable, or that the continuance of the agreement is no longer consistent with the intent, purpose and requirements of this act, or is a detriment to the public interest or to the rights of other persons not parties to the agreement.</p>

                  <p>(a) An appropriator of underground water may change the location of his well to a point within the same aquifer in the vicinity of the original location, without loss of priority, by securing approval of the state board of control if the groundwater right has been adjudicated or if the groundwater right has not been adjudicated but the water has been applied to beneficial use. In cases involving domestic or stock water wells which are not adjudicated but the water has been applied to beneficial use, the state engineer may approve a change of location. If the right is not adjudicated and the water has not been applied to beneficial use, approval for the change in location may be granted by the state engineer. No petition shall be granted if the rights of other appropriators shall be injuriously affected thereby. No petition granted shall increase the total amount of the appropriation of water set forth in the original permit. The state board of control and the state engineer may make such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. The state engineer may approve a change of well location even if water has not been applied to a beneficial use.</p>
                  <p>(b) A decision by the state engineer granting or denying a petition to change the location of an unadjudicated right under this section may be appealed to the board of control. An appeal may be taken to the district court pursuant to W.S. 16-3-101 through 16-3-115 from an order of the board of control:</p>
                  <p>(i) Affirming or reversing a decision of the state engineer appealed to the board under this subsection; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Granting or denying a petition to change the location of an adjudicated right under this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person who intends to acquire the right to beneficial use of any underground water in the state of Wyoming, shall, before commencing construction of any well or other means of obtaining underground water or performing any work in connection with construction or proposed appropriation of underground water or any manner utilizing the water for beneficial purposes, file with the state engineer an application for a permit to make the appropriation and shall not proceed with any construction or work until a permit is granted by the state engineer, provided, that whenever a bore hole constructed for mineral exploration, oil and gas exploration, stratigraphic information or any other purpose not related to groundwater development shall be found to be suitable for the withdrawal of underground water, application shall be filed with and approved by the state engineer before water from the bore hole is beneficially utilized. The state engineer may authorize the construction and use of multiple wells for industrial purposes for in situ mining, dewatering or use for pollution control or remediation with a single permit if the groundwater to be developed by the proposed appropriation is to be used for a specific purpose within the department of environmental quality permitted boundary and served from a single source of supply. The application shall contain the name and post-office address of applicant or applicants, a detailed description of the proposed use, the location by legal subdivision of the proposed well or other means of obtaining underground water, the estimated depth of the proposed well, the quantity of water proposed to be withdrawn and beneficially utilized in gallons per minute and acre-feet per calendar year, the location by legal subdivision of the area or point of use shall be provided, and such other information as the state engineer may require.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to providing the information required in subsection (a) of this section, applications for permits to appropriate groundwater, geothermal or otherwise, located within fifteen (15) miles of the boundary of Yellowstone National Park shall be accompanied by a written report prepared by a qualified professional and containing such geologic, hydrologic and other information necessary to show that the proposed development will not impair or produce an injurious effect on the hydrothermal system or hydrothermal features located within the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park. The state engineer shall consider all the information provided by the applicant and any other information available to him or necessary to make an informed decision before acting on the application. If upon review of the submitted information or other records available to him, the state engineer determines that the applicant has not shown that the proposed development will not impair or produce an injurious effect upon the hydrothermal features located within the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park, the state engineer shall deny the application for permit. Wells for domestic and stock purposes as defined in W.S. 41-3-907 will be exempt from the requirements of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to interfere with the right of any person to use water from any existing well constructed prior to May 24, 1969 where the water is economically and beneficially used for stock or domestic use as provided by W.S. 41-3-907, and the uses from the well are hereby declared to constitute a vested right, provided, that the owner of the water right must have registered the right prior to December 31, 1972. If the water right was not registered prior to December 31, 1972 an application shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of this section to obtain a water right and the applicant shall receive, as the water right priority date, the date the application is received by the state engineer.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon the filing of a petition to amend an existing water right or an application to appropriate underground water for any use other than domestic, stockwatering or miscellaneous purposes where the quantity of water to be appropriated is twenty-five (25) gallons of water per minute or less, from an area designated as a control area by the state board of control, the state engineer shall cause to be published, at applicant's expense, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county wherein the proposed well or requested change will be located, for at least once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks, a notice of the filing of the application or requested changes and that objections to the granting thereof may be filed within ten (10) days after the last publication of the notice, on the grounds that there is no unappropriated water in the proposed source of supply or that the granting of the application would be detrimental to the public interest. If objections are filed within the time specified in the notice, the state engineer shall set a date for a hearing on the application or requested changes and the objections thereto and shall notify the applicant or petitioner and the objectors thereof. If the applicant or petitioner questions the standing of the objector, the state engineer shall make written findings of fact on the issue and may overrule the objection on that basis. The hearing shall be before the control area advisory board and the state engineer, and shall be held in an appropriate place within the county in which the proposed well or requested change is to be located. The state engineer, for good cause, may impose costs of the hearing proportionally upon the applicant or petitioner and the objectors. The hearing under this subsection shall be a contested case hearing conducted in conformance with and subject to the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. A decision by the state engineer granting or denying an application or petition under this subsection may be appealed to the board of control within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of notice of the decision. Upon appeal and based on the contested case record and upon additional evidence, if any, taken at the direction of the board, the board may affirm, modify or reverse the findings of the state engineer. An appeal from an order of the board of control may be taken to the district court pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(b) If no objections are filed against the application or petition under subsection (a) of this section but the state engineer is of the opinion that the application or petition may be detrimental to the public interest, or desires to obtain the recommendations of the control area advisory board, he shall set a date for a public hearing on the application or petition and shall notify the applicant or petitioner of the time and place thereof. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing the state engineer shall cause notice of the hearing to be published, at the expense of the applicant or petitioner, in at least one (1) newspaper having general circulation in the county in which the proposed well or requested change is to be located. The state engineer shall notify the applicant or petitioner of the time and place of the hearing. The public hearing shall be held before the control area advisory board and the state engineer in an appropriate place in the county in which the proposed well or requested change is to be located. In making any determination required by this section, the state engineer may rely upon records and information on file in his office or in the office of the board of control. In the event a hearing is held he shall make known the records and information upon which he relies at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. A decision by the state engineer under this subsection may be appealed by the applicant or petitioner to the board of control within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of notice of the decision. Upon appeal the board of control shall conduct a contested case hearing in accordance with its rules and regulations and the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. An appeal from an order of the board of control may be taken to the district court pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(c) The application or petition shall be granted and the permit issued only if the state engineer finds, after receiving the advice of the control area advisory board, that there are unappropriated waters in the proposed source, that the proposed means of diversion or construction is adequate, that the location of the proposed well or other work does not conflict with any well spacing or well distribution regulation, and that the proposed use would not be detrimental to the public interest. If the state engineer finds that the application or petition is incomplete or otherwise defective, he shall return the application or petition for correction. If the correction is not made within ninety (90) days, the application or petition shall be rejected.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed By Laws 2014, Ch. 90, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(e) A petition to amend an existing water right which originated with the board of control may be subject to additional action by the board of control. Any petition to amend an existing water right granted by the state engineer pursuant to this section, if that decision is not appealed, shall be returned to the board of control for any additional action that may be required by law.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person constructing any well under a permit shall, within thirty (30) days after the completion or abandonment of such work, report to the state engineer the data required relating to such well, on forms furnished by the state engineer.</p>
                  <p>A well shall be considered complete when it is possible to install a pump and pump water. In the case of an artesian well, completion is the time when the drill rig is moved off of the drilling site.</p>
                  <p>(b) Adjudication of all ground water rights except stock watering and domestic uses of ground water referenced in W.S. 41-3-907 shall proceed upon completion of the work according to the terms of the permit and the recording on forms furnished by the state engineer of such information as is deemed necessary concerning the works, and the filing of a map signed by a Wyoming licensed professional engineer or land surveyor, showing the location of the well and the point or points of use. The state engineer or his authorized representative shall inspect the works, the lands irrigated or other uses being made of the water upon receipt of the map. The adjudication of stock watering and domestic uses of ground water referenced in W.S. 41-3-907 may be initiated by the state engineer or the appropriator of record and will not require the filing of a map signed by a Wyoming licensed professional engineer or land surveyor, showing the location of the well and the points and areas of use or require the inspection by the state engineer or his authorized representative of the works, the lands irrigated or other uses being made of the water unless, in the discretion of the state engineer, such procedures are deemed necessary and appropriate. At this time the board may consider for adjudication the ground water rights upon proof of beneficial use being submitted by the appropriator.</p>
                  <p>(c) Adjudication shall proceed in the same manner prescribed for the adjudication of surface water appropriations once the state engineer or his authorized representative has reported his findings to the board. A ground water appropriation attaches to the land for irrigation, or for such other purposes or object for which it was acquired.</p>
                  <p>(d) In the interest of an orderly adjudication procedure for ground water, the state engineer, with the concurrence of the board, may order adjudication of any ground water appropriations in the state. Upon one (1) year notice, any appropriator whose appropriation is to be adjudicated shall furnish the state engineer all of the documents mentioned in subsection (b) of this section. If any appropriator refuses to supply any of this information, the superintendent may tag and lock the well. Any appropriator that interferes with the tag or lock is subject to the same penalty as provided in W.S. 41-3-938. Use of water well so tagged or locked is prima facie evidence of such interference.</p>

                  <p>(a) Immediately after permits have been applied for under W.S. 41-3-1003(c), the water development commission shall determine the feasibility of providing instream flows for the recommended segments of streams from unappropriated direct flows or from existing storage facilities or from new facilities. The feasibility study shall include a determination of water necessary to maintain or improve existing fisheries for water rights under W.S. 41-3-1001(b) or of water necessary to provide fisheries for water rights under W.S. 41-3-1001(a). The feasibility study shall also include the availability of storage sites, the estimated cost of providing any required storage and such other findings and conclusions as the water development commission deems appropriate. The cost of any consultant and any associated costs that the water development commission determines are necessary to complete a feasibility study under this section shall be borne by the game and fish commission. The water development commission shall consult with the game and fish commission prior to entering into any contract related to a feasibility study under this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The water development commission shall make a report to the game and fish commission and the legislature outlining their findings.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any application for a permit to appropriate direct flow waters for the purpose of providing instream flows shall be by stream segment, as defined in W.S. 41-3-1002.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the water development commission, under W.S. 41-3-1004, determines that storage of water for the purpose of providing instream flows is not feasible but that appropriation of direct flow water appears feasible, the state engineer shall act on applications for permits to appropriate water filed under W.S. 41-3-1003(c) in the name of the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subsequent to submission of an application for an instream flow appropriation, the game and fish commission shall conduct relevant studies on the proposal.</p>
                  <p>(d) The applicant for an instream flow water right shall publish a notice of the application and hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the area near the proposed reservoir site or stream segment, once each week for at least two (2) consecutive weeks prior to the hearing provided by subsection</p>
                  <p>(e) of this section which notice shall briefly describe the application.</p>
                  <p>(e) Prior to granting or denying the application, the state engineer shall conduct any studies as are deemed necessary to evaluate the proposed instream flow and the necessary amount of water to maintain existing fisheries and shall hold a public hearing. At the public hearing, the game and fish commission shall present its studies and any other interested parties shall present views on the proposed instream flow appropriation. The state engineer may place a condition on the permit, if one is granted, requiring a review of the continuation of the permit as an instream flow appropriation.</p>
                  <p>(f) If an application for an instream flow appropriation is approved by the state engineer, it shall be deemed that work has been commenced and completed and beneficial use made thirty (30) days after the date of approval for purposes of W.S. 41-4-506 and proof of appropriation shall not be submitted until three (3) years thereafter.</p>
                  <p>(g) The state engineer shall not issue an instream flow permit where the instream flow right would be included as a portion of the consumptive share of water allocated to the state of Wyoming under any interstate compact or United States supreme court decree.</p>
                  <p>(h) The amount of water appropriated for instream flow in each river basin in Wyoming shall not result in more water leaving the state than the amount of water that is allocated by interstate compact or United States supreme court decree for downstream uses outside of Wyoming.</p>

                  <p>(a) A right to the use of excess water as defined by W.S. 41-4-329 in the amount of one (1) cubic foot per second for each seventy (70) acres of land having an adjudicated water right or a water right under permit, except those having a priority date prior to March 2, 1945, is hereby adjudicated to attach to all original direct flow water rights, and only on lands described in adjudicated appropriations of record in the office of the state board of control or under valid permits or filings of record in the office of the state engineer. The rights so adjudicated shall bear date of priority as of March 1, 1985. Rights unadjudicated shall acquire the excess right as the original is perfected.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any permits issued or water rights granted in the state of Wyoming with a priority date after March 1, 1985, shall be subject to the adjudication of excess water as provided herein.</p>

                  <p>On receipt of an application for a permit to acquire the right to the beneficial use of the public water of the state of Wyoming, which application shall be on a form prescribed or designated by the state engineer, it is the state engineer's duty to date the application and to make a record of receipt of the application in his office. It is the state engineer's duty to examine all applications to ascertain that they contain all the necessary information to show the location, nature and amount of the proposed beneficial use. If the proposed beneficial use is for irrigation purposes, the application shall give the total acreage to be irrigated and the acreage in each legal subdivision of land proposed to be irrigated. If, upon such examination, an application submitted in hard copy is found defective, it is the duty of the state engineer to return the application for correction, with reasons therefor, and the time allowed within which to make such corrections, which shall not be less than ninety (90) days, shall be endorsed on the application, or by correspondence accompanying the return of the application, and a record made thereof. A like record shall be kept of the date of the return of corrected applications, and of the date of the refusal and return of applications rejected. If the application is submitted in hard copy, the defective application shall be returned by certified mail, requesting return receipt. If the application is submitted electronically, the defective application shall be returned electronically. If, at the expiration of the time allowed within which to make such corrections, the application has not been returned to the office of the state engineer with the corrections properly made, it is the duty of the state engineer to cancel the filing covered by the application. The state engineer, if in his opinion an extension is justified, or, upon request by the applicant for good cause shown, shall grant extensions of time for making corrections. However, extensions will not be granted if the request for the extension is received after the expiration of the time period the applicant seeks to extend.</p>

                  <p>(ii) If the applicant is not an incorporated company, he may require a showing as to the name or names of the party or parties proposing to construct the work, and a showing of facts necessary to enable him to determine whether or not they have the financial ability to carry out the proposed work, and whether or not the said application has been made in good faith.</p>

                  <p>Whenever the state engineer places his endorsement of approval on any application for a water permit, he shall require that actual construction work be completed within the time set by him in the permit. The time set for completion shall not exceed a period of five (5) years after the date of approval of application. In the case of an application for a ditch permit, he shall further require that the application of the water to beneficial use must be completed before the date which he shall specify, and which shall not be earlier than the date specified for the completion of construction; and that final proof of appropriation must be submitted within five (5) years after the date specified for the completion of the application of the water to beneficial use. He may limit the application to a less period of time for the completion of construction and application of water to beneficial use than is asked for in the application. For good cause shown, the state engineer may at any time, or from time to time, before the date of expiration, extend any or all of these periods. An extension of time for compliance with any of the specified requirements shall be construed to automatically extend for a like period the time for compliance with any of the specific requirements in relation to which the time expires thereafter. Default by the holder of the permit in any of the specified requirements shall work a forfeiture of the water right involved. The state engineer may upon such default cancel the permit. The state engineer shall, by registered mail, with a return receipt requested at least three (3) months before default in any of these requirements shall be operative, notify the permit holder, at the post-office address given by him when the time allowed will expire. If the permit holder cannot be reached by registered mail, or if the address of the permit holder is unknown, the state engineer shall publish notice of the default for three (3) weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county, or in case there is no newspaper of general circulation published in the county, then in a newspaper published in the state of Wyoming and in general circulation in the county, the last publication to be at least two (2) months before cancellation of the permit.</p>

The map or plat shall be on a scale to conform to the regulations of the state engineer, showing the approximate location of all streams, proposed reservoirs, main canals and the other data required under the terms of W.S. 41-3-301, together with the approximate location and area of the lands to be irrigated and approximate capacity of each of the reservoirs to be constructed. It shall be the duty of the state engineer to approve any such application made in conformity herewith which contemplates the application of the water of a drainage basin to the beneficial use of a major irrigable portion thereof where the proposed use does not tend to impair the value of existing rights, or to be otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; provided, however, that any permit for appropriation of waters for beneficial uses upon the irrigable lands designated in such a drainage basin project application, must be conditioned for the submission to the state engineer of detailed maps, plans and specifications applicable to a single subdivision of the project and the approval thereof by the state engineer, prior to the commencement of the construction of any such subdivisions; provided further that such subdivision maps, plans and specifications shall conform to the requirements hereinafter set forth as applicable to other applications not embracing the major irrigable portion of an entire drainage basin.</p>

                  <p>Whenever an appropriation of water has been perfected in accordance with any permit issued by the state engineer, the appropriator may submit final proof of appropriation of water at any time within the time specified by W.S. 41-4-506, to the superintendent of the water division in which the water right involved is situated, or, when more expedient, before the superintendent of another water division or the state engineer, or before a water commissioner in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 41-4-308. Proof shall be made by appropriators under oath upon forms furnished by the state board of control. The superintendent shall collect for each proof taken a fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), which fee shall be transmitted to the secretary of the board of control together with the several proofs taken. The secretary of the board of control shall use the fee to pay the appropriate amount for the county recording fee for the recording of the certificate of appropriation in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the water right is situated and the newspaper advertising fee for advertising the several proofs as provided in this section. The remainder of the fee shall be remitted to the state treasurer to the credit of the general fund. If the board of control rejects any proof, the fee shall be returned to the person, association or corporation submitting such proof. At least thirty (30) days prior to any regular meeting of the state board of control the superintendent of each water division shall cause all proofs taken by him to be advertised in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper having general circulation in the community where the water right involved is situated, such advertisement to contain in each case the permit number, the date of priority, the name of the ditch, canal or reservoir, the name of the appropriator, the name of the stream from which the appropriation is made, and the amount of the appropriation expressed in acres for ditches designed for the irrigation of lands and in acre-feet for reservoirs, or in cubic feet per second or gallons per minute when the appropriation is for domestic, stock, municipal, industrial, manufacturing, fish hatchery or power purposes. Advertisements shall state the time when, and the place where, the proofs of appropriation of water taken by the superintendent will be open for public inspection for a period of not less than one (1) or more than five (5) days, and the last day of the period shall not be less than fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting of the board. Any party claiming an interest in any water right from the stream or streams to which the advertised proofs refer, shall have the right to contest the proposed adjudications according to the provisions of W.S. 41-4-312 through 41-4-315. Upon the completion of the taking of proofs of appropriation and the advertising, the superintendent of each water division shall transmit to the office of the state board of control in Cheyenne the several proofs taken, together with fees collected, and shall accompany the same with affidavits of publication as evidence of the required advertisement. At its next regular meeting the board shall consider all proofs of appropriation received from the division superintendents and if satisfied that there are no conflicts and that any appropriation involved has been perfected in accordance with the permit issued by the state engineer, the state board of control by the hand of its president, attested under seal, shall issue a certificate of appropriation of water as described in W.S. 41-4-325 and send the certificate to the county clerk of the county in which the use of water has been made to be recorded by the clerk as provided in W.S. 41-4-325.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state engineer may correct clerical errors and, upon written petition of the permit holder, amend any permit to appropriate water at any time prior to adjudication by the state board of control when in the judgment of the state engineer the amendment appears necessary, and providing:</p>
                  <p>(i) No petition to amend shall be granted if existing water appropriators who have adjudicated water rights or valid permits are injuriously affected;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The priority date of the permit shall not be improved;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The total amount of the appropriation of water shall not exceed the amount set forth in the original permit and, for irrigation permits, the total area of land shall not exceed the total area described in the original permit;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The changes shall be limited to those within the area and concept of the original application for permit or development plan;</p>

                  <p>(vi) A reasonable filing fee not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) shall accompany each petition filed with the state engineer.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state engineer may hold a public hearing on a petition under subsection (a) of this section to gather facts to determine if other appropriators will be injuriously affected. The state engineer shall hold a public hearing on a petition under subsection (a) of this section if requested to do so by any affected appropriator. If the state engineer holds a public hearing, the state engineer shall cause to be published no less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing a notice of the hearing to be advertised in at least one (1) issue of any newspaper having general circulation in the community where the water right or valid permit involved is situated. The petitioner shall pay the cost of the advertisement prior to the time of hearing, and provide a record of proceedings to be transmitted to the state engineer. Following receipt of the record, the state engineer shall promptly review the record and issue a written order granting or denying the permit amendment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any decision by the state engineer granting or denying a permit amendment under this section may be appealed to the board of control which shall conduct a contested case hearing in accordance with its rules and regulations and the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(d) The state board of control is authorized, upon the written petition of the owner, to issue amended certificates of appropriation for water rights that have been adjudicated for the purpose of correcting clerical errors and when in the judgment of the board it appears necessary. The total amount of the appropriation of water shall not exceed the amount set forth in the original certificate of appropriation and, in the case of an appropriation for irrigation use, the total area of the lands shall not exceed the total area described in the original certificate of appropriation. The amended area shall not exceed the area actually irrigated under the original right. Any petitioner shall be the owner of all the land involved in the petition, except that in cases where amendments are petitioned for in a regularly organized conservancy or irrigation district, the consent of the district board and the consent or agreement of the land owners directly involved is sufficient. Proper adjustments shall be made in any assessment levied against lands affected by the amendment. The rights of other appropriators shall not be injuriously affected thereby.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon petition for an amended certificate of appropriation of water, the state board of control may cause a public hearing to be held on the petition before the superintendent of the water division in which such appropriation is located, with notice of the hearing to be advertised in at least one (1) issue of a newspaper having general circulation in the community where the water right involved is situated. The state board of control shall hold a public hearing if requested to do so by any affected appropriator. The petitioner shall pay the cost of the publication prior to the time of hearing and provide a record of proceedings to be transmitted by the division superintendent to the state board of control, together with his report. At the time the petition is filed a fee not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) for each amended certificate issued shall be collected by the state board of control with a deposit of sufficient funds to cover the cost of preparing and recording a certified copy of the order. The fees for recording shall be returned to the petitioner in case the petition is not granted.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>41-5-111. Irrigation facility modification and maintenance.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any person who, acting directly or indirectly through an agent or representative, in trespass or in other violation of the rights of a user, wrongfully modifies an existing irrigation ditch or other irrigation facility in any manner that diminishes the capacity or adversely affects the utility of the ditch or irrigation facility is liable to the users for all restoration costs. If restoration is not feasible and the effort or cost of maintaining the modified ditch or facility is increased, then the person is thereafter liable to the users for the amount of increased maintenance that results from the modifications.</p>
                  <p>(b) For cases in which restoration is feasible, any adversely affected user may serve a written demand for restoration. If restoration is not feasible and requires increased maintenance, efforts or costs, any adversely affected user may serve a written demand for immediate and continued maintenance. A copy of this section shall be annexed to the written demand. The demand shall be delivered to the actor in person, or if the actor cannot be found then the demand shall be delivered conspicuously to the actor’s usual place of business or residence. If the actor fails to accomplish complete restoration or all the currently necessary maintenance within forty-eight (48) hours after the written demand is delivered in accordance with this subsection, the user may perform the restoration and may do the maintenance that is then necessary, as well as that which becomes necessary thereafter, and may recover the reasonable costs thereof from the actor. If the modification is so gross that restoration cannot reasonably be completed within the forty-eight (48) hour period, then the duty to restore is satisfied when:</p>
                  <p>(i) Within twenty-four (24) hours after delivery of the demand, the actor undertakes a good faith effort to mitigate harm to other users and to restore the facility and the effort is:</p>
                  <p>(A) Commensurate with the magnitude of harm or potential harm to the users; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Continuously and diligently pursued to completion in a timely manner.</p>
                  <p>(c) Every user who provides the restoration or maintenance shall have a lien on the actor’s interest or property that is involved in the modification. If the property involved is land, the lien extends to one (1) acre, unless the modification extends or covers more than one (1) acre, in which case the lien shall extend to all the additional land covered by the modification. If the land subject to the modification is located in any city, town or subdivision, the lien shall extend to each entire lot upon which the modification is located. If the actor's interest or property is only a ditch right or reservoir right, or such, then the one (1) acre shall be at the site where the water under the actor's ditch or reservoir right, or other interest is first applied to beneficial use.</p>
                  <p>(d) In order to have a perfected lien, a lien claimant shall file with the county clerk a lien statement that conforms to the requirements of W.S. 29-1-312, and shall notify the last known record owner as provided in W.S. 29-1-312. The county clerk shall record and index the statement as provided in W.S. 29-1-312. When so perfected, the lien may be enforced in the same manner as provided in W.S. 29-4-101 and 29-4-102 and is subject to the limitation in W.S. 29-2-109.</p>
                  <p>(e) If litigation is necessary to enforce the lien, the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs of litigation, to be fixed and awarded by the court, unless the court finds that the nonprevailing party had reasonable grounds to expect to prevail.</p>
                  <p>(f) The remedies provided by this section are not exclusive but are supplemental to other remedies in law or equity. This section does not in any way alter or affect law regarding water rights, covenants, easements or other servitudes, or other rights.</p>
                  <p>(g) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Actor" means a person who wrongfully modifies an existing irrigation ditch or other irrigation facility as specified in subsection (a) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "User" means an individual, ditch company whether organized or unorganized, irrigation district, or other person or entity lawfully permitted to use water under an adjudicated or other valid water right who uses a ditch or facility for conveyance of direct flow, or waste water, or storage of water in the beneficial use of water under the water right.</p>

In case an action is commenced upon the bond of a contractor liable for the claim, and in such case the result of such action shall be binding upon the subcontractor, and his sureties, and in any case when a contractor has paid a claim for which a subcontractor is liable, such contractor shall bring action against the subcontractor and his sureties within sixty (60) days after the payment of such claim.</p>

Upon receipt of any such payment, said county treasurer shall cause proper credit to be entered upon the record of said assessment, and thereafter a corresponding reduction shall be made in the annual installments of said assessment to be collected.

                  <p>When two (2) or more persons, joint owners in an irrigation ditch or reservoir, not incorporated, or their lessees, are unable to agree relative to the division or distribution of water received through their ditch or from their reservoir, it shall be lawful for any of the owners or lessees to apply to the water commissioner of the district in which the ditch or reservoir shall be located, by a written notice setting forth that fact, asking the water commissioner to take charge of the ditch or reservoir for the purpose of making a just division or distribution of the water from the ditch or reservoir to the parties entitled to the use of the water. The water commissioner shall take exclusive charge of the ditch or reservoir for the purpose of dividing the water in accordance with rights established by existing decrees, and continuing the work until the necessity shall cease to exist. In all cases where the water commissioner or a deputy water commissioner is called upon to divide the waters of a ditch or reservoir between appropriators, when the term of his employment exceeds three (3) consecutive days he shall be paid in full for his service by the interested water users in proportion to the established rights of each. Any payments not made for the service of the water commissioner after a written demand has been made for payment, the bill for the water commissioner's services shall be a lien upon any land or other property owned by an interested water user refusing to pay and may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any reimbursement recovered under this section for services of the water commissioner shall be paid into the general fund.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever a majority of the freeholders owning lands and the entrymen upon public lands in any district who shall represent one-third the area of lands within said district, or whenever the freeholders owning lands and the entrymen upon public lands who shall represent more than one-half the area of lands within said district, desire to provide for the irrigation of the same; or to improve the existing water supply for said lands; or to purchase, extend, operate or maintain constructed irrigation works; or to cooperate with the United States under the federal reclamation laws heretofore or hereafter enacted, or for the assumption as principal or guarantor of indebtedness to the United States on account of district lands, they may file in the district court of the county which embraces the largest acreage of the district, a petition, hereinafter referred to as the "petition", which shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name of the proposed irrigation district;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The necessity of the proposed work describing the necessity;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The object and purpose of the system proposed to be constructed, together with a general description thereof;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A general description of the lands proposed to be included in said district. Accompanying said petition shall be a preliminary engineering report on the feasibility of the project, including a report on the sufficiency of its water supply; the approximate area of irrigable land within the district, including an estimate of the cost of construction; all of which shall be approved by the state engineer;</p>
                  <p>(v) The names of all freeholders owning lands and the entrymen on public lands in said district, when known;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Whether or not the petitioners desire and propose to cooperate with the United States;</p>

Several similar petitions for the organization of the same district may be circulated, and when filed, shall together be regarded as one petition having as many signers as there are separate signers on the several petitions filed. All petitions for the organization of said district filed prior to the hearing on said petition shall be considered by the court, the same as if filed with the first petition placed on file, and the signatures thereon contained shall be counted in determining whether sufficient persons have signed said petition.</p>

If a majority of the qualified electors voting should vote in favor of such an increase the district commissioners shall forthwith proceed to redivide the district into five (5) subdivisions as nearly equal in size as may be practicable, and commissioners shall be elected to represent all districts, as redivided, at the next general election of the district, and the terms of such commissioners and the order of their retirement shall be as provided for in the case of first election of commissioners after the formation of the district;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Establishing said district as a corporation by the name proposed with powers:</p>
                  <p>(A) To sue and be sued;</p>
                  <p>(B) To adopt and use a corporate seal;</p>
                  <p>(C) To have perpetual succession;</p>
                  <p>(D) To file on and acquire the right to use of water for domestic and irrigation purposes; to acquire sites for reservoirs, and rights of way for ditches, canals and laterals;</p>
                  <p>(E) To exercise the power of eminent domain under chapter 316 (C.S. 1920), and all acts or parts of acts amendatory thereto;</p>
                  <p>(F) To contract with the state of Wyoming for the reclamation and segregation of public lands pursuant to the laws of the United States and the state of Wyoming and to contract for the sale of water rights by it acquired pursuant to said laws, and to purchase and acquire state lands;</p>
                  <p>(G) To acquire by purchase or otherwise irrigation works, water rights, land and other property and to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the same, to buy, develop, sell and distribute electrical energy as an incident to the ownership, control and operation of irrigation works of the district or the cooperative works of the district and the United States as the district may deem expedient or suitable for the development of the district.</p>
                  <p>(v) Shall appoint one (1) commissioner from each commissioner district, who shall be a freeholder or entryman upon public lands, in said district, provided, however, if the majority of the irrigable area of the district is unentered public land, a majority of the commissioners shall be appointed by the secretary of the interior, who shall be residents of the state. The commissioners appointed by the court shall at all times be under the direction of the court and may be removed from office by the court upon good cause shown; provided, however, no commissioner shall be removed until written charges specifying the ground upon which such removal is sought are filed, and an opportunity given such commissioner to be heard at a hearing provided. In case a commissioner has been removed under this provision the court shall immediately appoint a successor. All findings and order of the court made at the hearing herein provided for shall be final and conclusive unless appealed from to the supreme court within thirty (30) days after filing thereof.</p>

                  <p>Before entering upon their duties, commissioners shall take and subscribe an oath to support the constitution of the United States and the constitution of the state of Wyoming, to faithfully and impartially discharge their duties as commissioners and to render a true account of their doing to the court by which they are appointed whenever required by law or the order of the court. Commissioners shall execute a bond running to the clerk of court and his successors in office as obligees, to be filed with the clerk for the benefit of the parties interested, in an amount to be fixed by the court or presiding judge, and with sureties to be approved by the court or presiding judge, conditioned for the faithful discharge of their duties as commissioners and the faithful accounting of all monies which shall come into their hands as commissioners. A majority shall constitute a quorum and a concurrence of a majority in any matter within their duties shall be sufficient to its determination. The commissioners appointed shall hold their office until the first regular meeting of the commissioners following the date of the order organizing the district and until their respective successors are qualified under the provisions of W.S. 41-7-316. The commissioners appointed by the secretary of the interior shall be subject to removal from office and any commissioner appointed by the secretary of the interior to fill a vacancy shall hold office until less than a majority of the lands within the district are unentered public lands, after which the commissioners shall be elected as otherwise provided in this chapter. If the office of any commissioner so appointed shall become vacant by reason of death, or other cause, the court or judge thereof shall appoint a qualified person to fill the vacancy.</p>

                  <p>The commissioners appointed as aforesaid, and their successors in office, shall, from the entry of such order of confirmation, constitute the corporate authority of said irrigation district, and shall exercise the functions conferred on them by law. They shall organize as a board, elect a president from their number and appoint a secretary-treasurer who may or may not be a member of the board. The board shall have power, and it shall be their duty, to adopt bylaws, manage and conduct the affairs and business of the district, make and execute all necessary contracts, employ such agents, attorneys, officers and employees as may be required, and prescribe their duties, establish equitable rules and regulations for the distribution and use of water to and upon the lands of the district; provided, always, that such rules shall not be in conflict with or contrary to any statute of this state relative to such matters; and generally to perform all such acts as shall be necessary to fully carry out the purposes of this article [chapter]. Said board shall have the power in addition to the means to supply water to said district proposed by the petition submitted for the formation of said district, to construct, acquire or purchase any and all canals, ditches, reservoirs, reservoir sites, water rights, rights of way, or other property necessary for the use of the district. In case of the purchase of any property by such district the bonds of the district hereinafter provided for may be used at their par value in payment without previous offer of such bonds for sale. For the purpose of acquiring control over government land within the district and complying with the provisions of the act of congress of August 11, 1916, the board shall have authority to make such investigation, and based thereon, such representation and assurances to the secretary of the interior as may be requisite; and the board may contract with the United States for the construction, operation and maintenance of the necessary works for the delivery and distribution of water therefrom under the provisions of the federal reclamation act, and all acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto and the rules and regulations established thereunder, or for the assumption, as principal or guarantor of the indebtedness to the United States on account of district lands. The board may contract with the United States for a water supply under any act of congress providing for or permitting such contract and in case any contract has been or may thereafter be made with the United States as herein provided, bonds of the district may be deposited with the United States at ninety percent (90%) of their par value, to the amount to be paid by the district to the United States under any such contract, the interest on said bonds, if bearing interest, to be provided for by assessment and levy as in case of other bonds of the district and regularly paid to the United States to be applied as provided in such contract; and if bonds of the district are not so deposited it shall be the duty of the board to include as part of any levy or assessment provided for herein, an amount sufficient to meet each year all payments accruing under the terms of any such contract; and the board may accept on behalf of the district, appointment of the district as a fiscal agent of the United States, or authorization of the district by the United States to make collection of moneys for or on behalf of the United States, in connection with any federal reclamation project, whereupon the district shall be authorized to so act and to assume the duties and liabilities incident to such action, and the said board shall have full power to do any and all things required by the federal statutes now or hereafter enacted in connection therewith, and all things required by the rules and regulations now or that may hereafter be established by any department of the federal government in regard thereto. The board shall have the power to buy, develop, sell and distribute electrical energy as an incident to the ownership, control and operation of the irrigation works of the district or the cooperative works of the district and the United States and to use, sell and distribute the same. The said rules and regulations shall be printed in convenient form as soon as the same are adopted, for the distribution in the district; provided, however, that the commissioners of the district shall not contract with the United States for the construction, operation or maintenance of the necessary works for the delivery and distribution of water to district lands, or for the drainage of district lands, under the provisions of the federal reclamation act and any act or acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, or the rules and regulations established thereunder, or for the assumption as principal or guarantor, of indebtedness to the United States on account of district lands, or for a water supply or drainage incident to irrigation under any act of congress providing for or permitting such contract, or for acceptance by the district of appointment or authorization as fiscal agent of the United States to make collections of moneys for or on behalf of the United States in connection with any federal reclamation project, until there has been an election duly held at which a majority of the qualified electors present and voting have voted in favor of making any such contract.</p>

                  <p>(a) As soon as may be after the organization of said district, or within such time as the court may direct, said commissioners shall proceed to have all necessary levels taken and surveys made, and shall lay out said proposed work, make a map thereof and plans, profiles and other specifications thereof, and report in writing to the court:</p>
                  <p>(i) The extent and character of the proposed work and the sufficiency of the water supply;</p>
                  <p>(ii) What lands within the district, as by them reported will be injured by the proposed work, if any, and they shall therein award to each tract, lot, easement or interest by whomsoever held, the amount of damages which they shall determine will be caused to the same by the proposed work;</p>
                  <p>(iii) All lands within the district as by them reported will be benefited by the proposed work and they shall assess against such lands by whomsoever held the amount of benefits which they determine will be caused to the same by the proposed work, and in case of lands having appurtenant thereto a partial water right or partial rights in a system of irrigation the assessment shall be according to benefits making due allowance for existing rights. The benefits so assessed are herein referred to as "the assessment roll".</p>
                  <p>(b) If it be found necessary to change the boundaries of said proposed district, previously fixed, they shall report said proposed change, and, if possible, shall report the names, the residence and post-office addresses of the owners or persons entitled to possession of all lands affected by said change in boundaries, but no such change in boundaries shall be made as to deprive the court of jurisdiction; provided, however, that the owners and those entitled to possession, by virtue of public land filing, of lands adjacent to the district, petition to have their lands brought into the district such petitioners may be considered the same as the original petitioners in making changes of boundaries.</p>
                  <p>(c) They shall also determine and report to the court the total itemized amount as near as they can determine, that said proposed work will cost, including organization expenses and the unit cost upon which the assessments are based, which shall be designated as "cost of construction".</p>
                  <p>(d) If the cost of construction of any particular part of the work so proposed to be done shall be assessed upon any particular tract or tracts, lot or lots of land, the commissioners shall so specify, and in their report they shall fix and determine the sums which should be assessed against said tracts and lots, and assess such sum against said tracts and lots.</p>
                  <p>(e) They shall apportion and assess the part of this "cost of construction" not assessed as above, against the several benefited tracts and lots in said irrigation district, in proportion to the benefits which they have assessed against the same, by setting down opposite each tract or lot the sum which they assess against the same for construction. The assessments which together make up the cost of construction, as above defined, as herein referred to as "assessments for construction".</p>
                  <p>(f) They shall set forth in their report the amount of water by them apportioned to each separate tract or lot of land in said district, to be assessed.</p>
                  <p>(g) The commissioners shall further report to the court the probable cost of keeping said proposed work in repair after it is completed.</p>
                  <p>(h) They shall include in their said report, said map, plans and other specifications, and file the same with their report.</p>

                  <p>(a) The commissioners, their agents, servants, and employees shall have the right to go upon all lands along any reservoirs, ditch, canal, or embankment in their district, to inspect, deepen, widen and repair the same whenever necessary, doing no unnecessary damage, and shall not be liable for trespass therefor.</p>
                  <p>(b) Said commissioners shall have the right to lay out and construct all necessary canals, ditches, drains and embankments across any railway right-of-way or yard within their district, and any railway company whose right-of-way or yard is crossed by the line of any proposed canal, ditch, drain or embankment shall open its right-of-way or yard and permit such canal, ditch, drain or embankment to cross the same as soon as such canal, ditch, drain or embankment is constructed to such right-of-way. Upon receiving fifteen (15) days notice in writing any railway company across whose right-of-way or yard any such canal, ditch, drain or embankment is laid out, shall open its right-of-way or yard and permit said commissioners and their contractors, agents and employees to construct such canal, ditch, drain or embankment across said right-of-way or yard. For every day that such railway company fails, after the end of said fifteen (15) days to open its right-of-way or yard as hereinbefore required, it shall forfeit twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to said irrigation district to be collected in an action as other forfeitures are collected, or to be set off against any damages that have been awarded to such railway company. If such railway company fails to open its right-of-way or yard along the line of any such canal, ditch, drain or embankment, the commissioners may at any time after the expiration of said fifteen (15) days open such right-of-way or yard along the line of such canal, ditch, drain or embankment and construct the same. Every irrigation district shall be liable to the railway company whose right-of-way or yard is crossed by any canal, ditch, drain or embankment of the district, for the reasonable cost of any culverts or bridges for railway purposes made necessary by the crossing of such right-of-way or yard by any such canal, ditch, drain or embankment, but the cost so entailed shall not be greater than the average cost of other culverts and bridges of similar size installed on the same division of the railway, and crossing streams, canals, ditches or drains of approximately the same width and depth within a distance of one hundred (100) miles of the canals, ditches or drains of said district.</p>

                  <p>(a) At any annual meeting of the irrigation district, the district may elect to adopt either a calendar year basis for their district elections or a fiscal year basis for their district elections. If the district elects a calendar year basis, on or after the first day of February and before the last day in March next preceding the expiration of the terms of office of any irrigation district commissioner appointed in any irrigation district, organized under the provisions of this chapter, and on or after the first day of February and before the last day in March of each year thereafter, an election shall be held to elect a commissioner or commissioners for the district, in the manner prescribed by this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the district elects a fiscal year basis for their district elections similar to that of the county in which they are located, then on or after the first day of August and before the last day of September next preceding the expiration of the terms of office of any irrigation district commissioner appointed or elected in any irrigation district organized under the provisions of this chapter, and on or after the first day of August and before the last day in September of each year thereafter, an election shall be held to elect a commissioner or commissioners for the district, in the manner prescribed in this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) At the first election held in any district, one (1) commissioner shall be elected from each commissioner district who shall be a landowner thereof. Where the irrigation district is divided into three (3) subdivisions, the commissioner from district number 1 shall serve as a commissioner for a term of one (1) year, the commissioner from district number 2 shall serve as a commissioner for a term of two (2) years, and the commissioner from district number 3 shall serve as a commissioner for a term of three (3) years. Where the district is divided into five (5) subdivisions, the commissioners from districts numbers 1 and 2 shall serve as commissioners for a term of one (1) year, commissioners from districts numbers 3 and 4 shall serve as commissioners for a term of two (2) years, and the commissioner from district number 5 shall serve as a commissioner for a term of three (3) years. Thereafter, all commissioners elected shall serve for a term of three (3) years, and until their successors are elected and qualified, except commissioners elected to fill an unexpired term.</p>
                  <p>(d) The term of an elected commissioner shall commence upon the date of the next regular meeting of the commissioners held after his election. If a majority of the commissioners are appointed by the secretary of the interior as provided for in this chapter, then the remaining commissioners shall be elected at large within the entire irrigation district for terms of three (3) years each. The terms however, shall be limited to and expire on the date of the next regular meeting of the commissioners held following the date when the unentered public lands within the district constitute less than the majority of the total acreage within the district. After the expiration of these terms, the commissioners shall be elected in the same manner and for the same terms as provided for herein in the case of first election of commissioners.</p>

                  <p>The commissioners of the district shall fix the hour and place, within the boundaries of or at a place convenient to the landowners within the irrigation district, of each election and preside at the same. It shall be the duty of the commissioners, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of an election, to mail to each person or corporation entitled to vote thereat, at his or its last known place of residence or business, a notice stating the time, place and purpose of such elections. Every person or corporation owning or entitled by virtue of public land filing to the possession of land situated within and being a part of any commissioner district in which an election for commissioner is being held, and upon which land no assessment for operation, maintenance or repairs is delinquent for more than four (4) years, shall be entitled to cast, for the commissioner to be elected, for the commissioner district wherein such land is situated, one (1) vote for each irrigable acre of such land assessed upon the last annual assessment of said district upon or against which land no assessment for operation, maintenance or repairs is delinquent for more than four (4) years. At the hour and place of such election the commissioners shall call the roll of those entitled to vote, and the number of votes each is entitled to cast. They shall make a record of the qualified voters present, receive all proxies and prescribe the manner of canvassing votes. All proxies shall be in writing and signed by the person or corporation entitled to vote.</p>

                  <p>At the time of the confirmation of any assessment provided for in this article, it shall be competent for the court to order the same to be paid in installments of such amount and at such time as will be convenient for the accomplishment of the purposes for which such assessment was made, and the payment of the principal and interest of such notes or bonds of said district as the court shall grant authority to issue, such installments to become delinquent on the same date or dates as may be fixed by law for state and county taxes to become delinquent, and such installments shall draw interest from the date of any notes or bonds issued by the district and for the payment of which said assessments are pledged at such rates not to exceed seven percent (7%) per annum, as may be fixed by the court; provided, however, that it shall be competent for the court, in case a contract is made between the United States of America and an irrigation district for the construction or sale of irrigation works and water rights, to order the charges to be paid in accordance with the provisions of an act of congress approved December 5, 1924, entitled: "An act making appropriations to supply deficiencies in certain appropriations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1924, and prior fiscal years; to provide supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925; and for other purposes," and all acts that may be hereafter enacted as amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto, and in such installments as fixed by contract between the district and the United States. The annual levy for payment of construction charges on the basis herein authorized shall continue to be made each year against each tract of land in the district against which benefits under such contract with the United States have been apportioned, until the full amount apportioned against the same has been paid; such installments to become delinquent on the same date or dates as may be fixed by law for state and county taxes to become delinquent and such installments, after they become due, shall draw interest at six percent (6%) per annum. All assessments provided for in this article, together with all interest thereon and all penalties for default in payment of same, and all costs of collecting the same shall, from the date of the order of court confirming such assessments until paid, constitute a perpetual lien in an amount not in excess of the benefits severally assessed, upon all the land and other property against which such assessments shall be levied, superior to all liens of every kind and nature whatsoever except the paramount lien of the state for the general state, county, city, town or school taxes, and no sale of such property to enforce any general state, county, municipal, or school tax, or other lien shall extinguish the perpetual lien of such assessments; and such assessments shall also be a lien upon all equities or interests in existing water appropriations for the irrigation of said lands when the title to said lands is vested in the United States, and when said water appropriations have attached to said lands. The commissioner shall have the power to enforce payment of such assessments, and all assessments by them duly levied and confirmed, by shutting off the supply of water to any and all lands upon which assessments are due and unpaid, and may refuse to deliver water to such lands until such assessments are paid. Any person having an interest in land assessed for construction may at any time within thirty (30) days after the confirmation of said report, pay to the court the amount of the assessment against his land or any tract thereof. Said payment shall relieve said land and water rights from the lien of said assessments for the cost of construction; provided, however, that any district organized within a federal irrigation project for co-operation between such districts and the United States, may contract and agree in connection with the acquisition of irrigation works and water rights and the taking over of the care, operation and control of the same from the United States, that each tract or parcel of land shall pay the charges conformed in the assessments against such tract or parcel of land, and that liability for charges thus assessed may by contract be conformed and limited to the particular tract or parcel of land in question and if so contracted, shall not be imposed as a charge or incumbrance upon other parcels or tracts of land within the district.</p>

                  <p>(a) Assessments to meet expenses of any current year of any district shall become due, payable and delinquent at such time or times each year as may be fixed by law for state and county taxes to become due, payable and delinquent. Commissioners having charge of any irrigation district shall on or before the first Tuesday of June of each year file with the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of such district, a report showing an itemized estimate of the money to be raised by assessment within the district for the purpose of constructing new work, maintenance and to meet the yearly current expenses of the district. In addition to the amount above provided, the commissioners may add a sum which in their judgment shall be sufficient to provide for possible delinquencies. Within thirty (30) days after filing such annual report, at a time and place to be fixed by the court or a judge thereof, the judge shall examine such report, hear all objections thereto, fix and determine the amount to be raised by assessments for the current year and cause such adjudication to be entered of record in said court and a certified copy thereof to be delivered to the commissioners of such district. The commissioners shall add thereto such amount as may be necessary to meet the principal and interest on lawful indebtedness of the district maturing during the current year, together with a sum which in their judgment shall be sufficient to provide for possible delinquencies. When thus completed it shall be known as "the budget of .... district for the year (year)" and also be verified under oath by any one (1) of the commissioners.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioners of any irrigation district within the state of Wyoming are hereby forbidden to incur any indebtedness for current expenses of the district in excess of the amount provided in the budget. Provided, however, in case a greater sum than that provided in the budget is required, the commissioners may file a petition setting forth the causes therefor, with the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of said district. Immediately upon the filing of said petition the court shall make an order fixing the time and place of hearing and directing the form and manner of notice thereof to be given if the court deem such hearing advisable. If the court shall authorize the expenditure of a greater sum of money the commissioners shall be authorized to incur indebtedness equal to the amount of the additional sum authorized by the court, and in case the expenditure occurs at a time when it is too late to place the amount upon the assessment roll for the current year such amounts may be added to the budget of ensuing years. All debts contracted in contravention of this section shall be void.</p>

                  <p>It shall be the duty of the commissioners of each irrigation district, on or before the third Monday in July in each year to prepare an assessment roll of said district, which shall contain the name of the owner, together with a description of each lot, tract and easement of land within said district and the aggregate assessments of benefits confirmed by the court against the same; the name of all corporations assessed together with the aggregate assessment levied against such corporations respectively. The assessment roll shall also show the amount assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land, and against each corporation in the district, for current expense and to meet the principal and interest on the indebtedness of the district for the current year. All such assessments to meet the principal and interest on the indebtedness of the district for the current year, shall be apportioned on the aggregate assessment of benefits last confirmed by the court. All such assessments for current expenses shall be based upon irrigable acreage and shall be uniform as to irrigable lands receiving the maximum apportionment of water from said district, and as to irrigable lands receiving less than such maximum apportionment such assessment shall bear the same proportion as the amount of water apportioned to such lands bears to the maximum apportionment of water to other lands in such district. Provided however, that the commissioners of any irrigation district may, in their discretion, provide for a minimum annual assessment for current expense. When such assessment roll is completed it shall be signed by the commissioners of said district, and verified by any one (1) of them. On or before the third Monday in July of each year the commissioners of the irrigation district shall deliver to the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such irrigation district the assessment roll of such district. The county commissioners of said county, immediately upon the receipt of the assessment roll of such district and at the time of making the requisite tax levy for county purposes, shall levy and assess against each lot, tract and easement of land and against each corporation, the respective amounts levied and assessed against the same on said assessment roll. Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county, and in case the territory embraced in such district is located in two (2) or more counties a copy of the assessment roll as certified to by the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such district shall be delivered to the assessor of each county in which any of the land of the district is located. Upon receipt of such assessment roll the assessors of the counties embracing any of the lands of such district, shall extend upon the tax roll of such county the respective amounts levied and assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land, and against each corporation as shown by said assessment roll of said districts.</p>

Provided, however, that in the case of the nonpayment of any taxes which have heretofore or may hereafter be levied, as above provided, the board of county commissioners, upon application made, shall have the power and it shall be the duty, upon written request of the board of such irrigation district, to order the said treasurer to receive in full payment of the bond fund portion of said taxes the principal amount of said tax levies, payable in bonds or bond interest coupons of said irrigation district at their face value, and maturing within the year in which said tax levies were made, as so much lawful money of the United States and in full payment of the maintenance, operating and current expense portion of any such taxes, such an amount, payable in cash or in warrants of said irrigation district at their face value, as the board of said irrigation district may authorize or approve, and to direct the cancellation and remission of all penalties and interests on such delinquent taxes, except, however, that the cost of any advertising shall be paid in cash. And provided further, that in case of any tax sales heretofore had for the nonpayment of any such taxes, the tax sale certificates of which are held by the county, the board of county commissioners of the county holding such tax sale certificates shall have the power, and it shall be its duty upon the written request of the board of such irrigation district, to sell and assign such tax sale certificates and all its interest in said property represented thereby or acquired therethrough, for the amount of the original tax levy on which said sale was based, and to receive in payment therefor for the bond fund portion thereof, bonds or interest coupons of said irrigation district at the face value thereof maturing within the year in which said tax levies were made, as so much lawful money of the United States, and for the maintenance, operating and current expense portion thereof, such an amount in cash or in warrants of said irrigation district at their face value as the board of said irrigation district may authorize or approve; and to cancel and remit all interest and penalties that may have accrued on said tax certificates, except that the cost of advertising shall be paid in cash. Any bonds, bond interest coupons or warrants of any such irrigation district used in payment of taxes or in the purchase of tax sale certificates, as herein provided, shall together with any interest on such bonds, coupons or warrants, be deemed fully paid and satisfied, and the irrigation district relieved from all obligations thereunder. The commissioners of any irrigation district may elect the treasurer of the county having jurisdiction of such district, treasurer of such district.</p>
                  <p>(b) The revenue laws of this state for the collecting of taxes on real estate for county purpose, except as herein modified, shall be applicable for the purposes of this act, including the payment of interest and enforcement of penalties and forfeitures for delinquent taxes; all penalties and interest on assessments of an irrigation district collected by the county treasurer shall be the property of such district, and shall be turned into the bond interest fund, and all interest and penalties collected on assessments of such district levied for purposes other than bonded indebtedness shall be paid to the treasurer of the district levying such assessment; such payments to be made on or before the fifth day of the month following the date of such collection. In advertising property for sale for delinquent taxes the county treasurer shall show in a separate column in such advertisement the amount of unpaid assessments levied against each lot, tract and easement of land in said district. The county treasurer of any county in which any portion of the land of any irrigation district is located, and at the time of advertising real property for sale for state and county taxes shall include in such advertisement the amount of delinquent irrigation district assessments against each lot, tract or easement of land. At the time and place of sale of real property for state and county taxes the county treasurer shall also separately sell the land for delinquent irrigation district assessments and shall issue separate certificates of sale therefor. In offering such real estate for sale for irrigation district assessments, the county treasurer shall offer the entire tract assessed, and the first bid received in an amount sufficient to pay such assessment, together with interest, penalty and costs, shall be accepted and the treasurer shall not attempt to secure a higher bid. In case no purchaser appears to purchase the land offered for sale for such delinquent assessments the county treasurer shall make an entry on his delinquent tax roll "sold to .... District of. County, Wyoming", and shall issue a certificate of purchase to such district. The owner of any tract, lot or easement of land in an irrigation district shall have the right to redeem the said land at any time within eighteen (18) months from the date of sale thereof by the county treasurer, as shown on said certificate by paying therefor the amount for which said land was sold by the county treasurer, together with such penalties and interest as may be provided by law relative to sales of land for delinquent state and county taxes, and in case the owner of any lot, tract or easement of land in any district shall fail to redeem said land from said sale for such assessment, the county treasurer shall issue a deed therefor to the purchaser at said sale, his heirs or assigns. The irrigation district purchasing such land at said tax sale shall have all the rights of natural persons in regard to owning, holding and selling such certificate and including the receipt of a deed, holding the title to real estate and selling and disposing of the same. The commissioners shall in no case sell said land or certificate of purchase for an amount less than the amount for which said land was sold to said district, including interest thereon, unless authorized so to do by the court. The procedure for the issuing of tax deed, including the form of the deed, time of publication and service of notice of intention to apply for deed, shall be the same as is now or may hereafter be provided by law for the issuances of tax deeds by the county treasurer upon the sale of land for state and county taxes, except as herein modified.</p>

                  <p>The commissioners may borrow money, not exceeding the amount of "assessment for construction," as herein provided, unpaid at the time of borrowing for such purposes, or for the payment of indebtedness they may have lawfully incurred, and may secure the same by notes or bonds bearing interest and not running beyond one (1) year after the last installment of the assessment, on the account of which the money is borrowed, shall fall due, which notes or bonds shall not be sold at less than ninety percent (90%) of their face value, which bonds shall be transferable by delivery to the same extent as negotiable paper of the highest character, and may deliver notes or bonds to the United States to be held and when deemed desirable or when the appraised value of the land in the district is double the bonded indebtedness, sold by it, and the net proceeds received from the notes or bonds applied to the liquidation of contract indebtedness of the district to the United States. Notes or bonds shall be in a form, terms and denominations as may be fixed by the secretary of the interior in carrying out the provisions of the act of congress of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat.</p>

In case any monies derived from bonds sold to pay for the construction, as herein provided, now or hereafter, remains on hand after the work is completed and paid for, and not raised for damages unpaid for, the residue may be used in the maintenance and repair, as in this chapter provided, before making assessment for maintenance and repair.</p>

                  <p>The court may, upon the petition of the commissioners, authorize them to refund a lawful indebtedness of the district now existing or which may hereafter be incurred by taking up and canceling all or a part of its outstanding notes and bonds, as fast as they come due or before, if the holders thereof will surrender the same, and issue in lieu thereof new notes or bonds of the district, payable in a time as the court deems proper, in an amount sufficient to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, together with an amount as the commissioners of the district deem necessary to provide for possible future defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments, and bearing interest. For the purpose of providing funds to pay the refunding bonds with interest thereon, the commissioners may levy assessments against the land in the district, but not in excess of the benefits assessed. In the alternative the commissioners may issue refunding bonds in an amount sufficient only to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, and may, if they desire to provide a fund to provide for possible defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments, levy from year to year assessments against the land in the district for such purposes, but not in excess of the benefits assessed against the same.</p>

This section shall not, however, prevent said commissioners, their agents, servants, and employees from going upon said lands to do any and all work found necessary prior to making their assessment of benefits and award of damages, and the trial on their report thereof.</p>

                  <p>The provisions of this article, relative to the levy and collection of payments, charges or assessments in irrigation districts shall not apply to any district which may be organized within a federal reclamation project for the purpose of cooperation between such district and the United States; provided, a different method for the levy and collection of payments, charges or assessments be agreed upon between such district and the United States; and they shall apply only with the modifications hereinafter set forth to an irrigation district which may have been organized within a federal reclamation project when the board of commissioners of such irrigation district by unanimous vote decide to make collection of their taxes or assessments through their own treasurer's office. Whenever the board of commissioners of an irrigation district, organized within a United States reclamation project by unanimous vote of said board decide to make collection of their taxes and assessments through their own office, they shall certify their action to the board of county commissioners of each county in which their district is situated, by a written certificate, which shall be over the signatures of its president and secretary. Such certificate shall be filed in the office of the county clerk of such county not later than July first of the year in which the change of place of payment is desired to be effective and thereafter all taxes or assessments levied or assessed for such district shall be collected by, and payable to the treasurer of the irrigation district, at the office designated by such district at the time and in the manner now fixed by statute. When a certificate is filed as hereinbefore provided, then and thereafter the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such irrigation district shall not be required to certify and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county or counties as otherwise provided by law, but shall certify and deliver said assessment roll to the treasurer of said district who shall act in lieu of and in place of the county treasurer in sending notices and collecting and receipting for such taxes or assessments. It shall be the duty of the treasurer of any irrigation district, following the method provided herein for collection of taxes or assessments to certify to the county treasurer of the county in which the land is situated the amount of any delinquent taxes or assessments on or before the 25th of May of each and every year and the county treasurer shall enter the same upon his delinquent tax list and make sale thereof as now provided by law. Any district which may or shall choose to make collection of its taxes or assessments as provided herein may revert back to the method of collection through the county treasurer's office by filing with the county clerk of the county or counties within which such district is located, a certificate showing the desire of a majority of its board of commissioners to change. Thereupon beginning with the first of July of the year in which the change is desired to be made, all the requirements of collection through the county treasurer's office shall be complied with.</p>

                  <p>It shall be the duty of the commissioners of each irrigation district in which an assessment for benefits and construction has not theretofore been approved or confirmed by the court to prepare an assessment roll of said district which shall contain the name of the owner, together with a description of each tract, lot and easement of land within said district, together with the aggregate assessment levied or assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land therein. All such assessments to meet the authorized expenditures of said district shall be apportioned among the various landowners owning lands within said irrigation district in such manner that each irrigable acre of land, as returned for assessment purposes by the county assessor, and as thereafter amended or confirmed by the county board of equalization, shall bear an equal part or portion of the total of said assessments as its assessed irrigable area, as returned by the county assessor, bears to the total irrigable area of land, returned by the county assessor, within said irrigation district. Such assessment roll of the district shall be signed by the commissioners thereof and verified by any one (1) of them. On or before the fourth Monday in May of each year the commissioners of any such irrigation district shall deliver to the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such irrigation district, the assessment roll of said district by filing the same in the office of the proper county clerk. The county commissioners of said county, acting as a board of equalization shall proceed to hear any and all complaints or objections thereto and correct, equalize and complete the same in such manner that said assessments listed in said assessment roll shall be equitably and ratably apportioned equally among the various irrigable lands included within said irrigation district. At the time of making the requisite tax levy for county purposes, the county commissioners of said county shall levy and assess against each tract, lot and easement of land, the respective amounts levied and assessed against the same upon said assessment roll as revised and corrected by them. Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of said county and in case the territory embraced in said district is located in two (2) or more counties, separate assessment rolls and proceedings shall be had and taken in each separate county, as required herein, but the assessment rate per irrigable acre as determined by the county commissioners having jurisdiction in the county in which the court proceedings are handled for said district shall be the rate per irrigable acre used by the county commissioners in all other counties in said district. Upon receipt of said assessment roll, the assessor of the county embracing any of the lands of said district shall extend upon the tax rolls of such county, the respective amounts levied against each lot, tract and easement of land as shown by said assessment roll of said district.</p>

                  <p>Whenever any contract between the United States and an irrigation district so provides, the assessment or assessments for benefits and construction against the individual tracts of land in the district, as now required under W.S. 41-7-401, may be dispensed with, and in such case the board of commissioners of the district, at any time, or after an election as provided by law has resulted in the approval of such contract, may file in the district court of the county embracing the largest acreage of the district, a petition praying in effect, that the contract and the proceedings leading up to the execution of same and the assessment for benefits and construction as requested therein may be examined, approved and confirmed by the court.</p>
                  <p>The petition shall state generally that the irrigation district was duly authorized, that due and lawful proceedings were taken to execute a contract with the United States which incurred a district indebtedness for construction charges to the United States in a maximum amount to be stated, and that the assessments to be levied against the individual tracts of land under the contract do not exceed the benefits to accrue to such tracts of land, respectively, by reason of such contract. The court shall, upon presentation of such a petition, fix a time for the hearing of said petition and shall order the clerk of the court to give and publish notice of the filing of the said petition, and of the time and place fixed for the hearing thereon. The notice of such hearing shall be published three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which such district is located and shall state the time and place fixed for the hearing of the petition, the prayer thereof, and that any person interested in the subject matter of the petition may, on or before three (3) days prior to the day fixed for the hearing thereof, answer or otherwise plead thereto, and no other notice shall be required to be given of the time and place of the hearing thereon. Upon the hearing on such proceedings, the court shall disregard every error, irregularity, or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of any party, and the court may make an order confirming and approving the proceedings taken to ratify and confirm such contract and the assessments for benefits and construction as required therein. The costs of the proceedings may be allowed and apportioned among the parties thereto in the discretion of the court.</p>

                  <p>Before any district shall enter into any contract for the construction, building, alteration, extension, or improvement of any irrigation works, power plant or system, or any part or section thereof for the use of the district, or for the purchase of any materials, machinery, or apparatus, such district shall cause estimates of the cost thereof to be made by some competent engineer or engineers and if such estimated cost shall exceed the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) no such contract shall be entered into for a price, cost or consideration exceeding such estimate nor without advertising for sealed bids. Prior to such advertisement, plans and specifications for the proposed construction work or materials shall be prepared and filed at the principal office or place of business of the district. Such advertisement shall be inserted for three (3) consecutive issues, with not less than twenty (20) days intervening between the first and last publication dates, in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the district and, in the discretion of the board of directors of the district, in such additional newspapers or trade or technical periodicals as may be selected by the board in order to give proper notice of the receiving of bids. Such advertisement shall designate the nature of the construction work proposed to be done or materials proposed to be purchased; that the plans and specifications therefor may be inspected at the office of the district, giving the location thereof, and shall designate the time within which bids shall be filed and the date, hour and place the same shall be opened. The board of directors of the district, with the assistance of the state engineer, whose duty it shall be to supervise such lettings, may let the contract for such work or materials to the lowest responsible bidder, or, in the sole discretion of the board, all bids tendered may be rejected and readvertisement for bids made in the manner, form and time in this section provided. No such contract shall be valid nor shall any money of the district be expended thereunder unless advertisement and letting shall have been had as in this section provided. Such contract shall provide that wherever possible workmen who are citizens of Wyoming shall be employed by the contractor. All provisions of W.S. 16-6-112 through 16-6-115, with reference to contractor's bonds, shall be applicable and effective as to any contract let pursuant to the provisions of this act; provided further, that if all or a portion of the cost of the proposed works is to be met by grant of labor or a grant in aid from a federal or state agency, the rules and regulations of which agency provide that work shall not be done by contract, the board may proceed with the necessary construction or other work without first complying with any of the foregoing provisions of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board shall create three (3) separate funds, one (1) fund to be known as the construction fund, another fund to be known as the water fund, and another fund to be known as the sinking fund, each such fund to be identified by the same series letter or letters as the bonds, warrants, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness of such series. A separate account shall be kept of each construction fund and of each water fund and of each sinking fund for each project.</p>
                  <p>(b) The proceeds of the sale of the bonds and other evidences of indebtedness of each series issued under the provisions of this act shall be placed to the credit of the appropriate construction fund, which fund shall at all times be kept segregated and set apart from all other funds. There shall also be credited to the appropriate construction fund the interest received upon the deposits of moneys in such fund and moneys received by way of gift or grant from the United States or from any other source for the construction of the works. The moneys in each construction fund shall be paid out or disbursed in such manner as may be determined by the board, subject to the provisions of this act, to pay the cost of the works as hereinabove defined. Any surplus which may remain in any construction fund after providing for the payment of the cost of the works shall be added to and become a part of the appropriate sinking fund hereinafter provided for.</p>
                  <p>(c)(i) The board is hereby authorized and empowered, subject to the provisions of this act, to fix and establish the prices, rates and charges at which any and all the resources and facilities made available under the provisions of this act shall be sold and disposed of; to enter into any and all contracts and agreements, and to do any and all things which in its judgment are necessary, convenient or expedient for the accomplishment of any and all the purposes and objects of this act, under such general regulations and upon such terms, limitations and conditions as it shall prescribe; and it is and shall be the duty of the board to enter into such contracts and fix and establish such prices, rates and charges so at to provide at all times funds which will be sufficient to pay all costs of operation and maintenance of any and all of the works authorized by this act, together with necessary repairs thereto, and which will provide at all times sufficient funds to meet and pay the principal and interest of all bonds, warrants, notes, debentures and other evidences of indebtedness as they severally become due and payable; provided, that nothing contained in this act shall authorize any change, alteration or revision of any such rates, prices or charges as established by any contract entered into under authority of this act except as provided by any such contract;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Every contract made by the board for the sale, conveyance and distribution of water, use of water, water storage, electric power or other service, or for the sale of any property or facilities, shall provide that in the event of any failure or default in the payment of any moneys specified in such contract to be paid to the board, the board may, upon such notice as shall be prescribed in such contract, terminate such contract and all obligations thereunder. The act of the board in ceasing on any such default to furnish or deliver water, use of water, water storage, electric power or other service under such contract shall not deprive the board of, or limit any remedy provided by such contract or by law for the recovery of any and all moneys due or which become due under such contract;</p>
                  <p>(iii) All income or profit and revenue of the works and all moneys received from the sale, conveyance, distribution or disposal of water, use of water, water storage, electric power or other service, and from the operation, lease, sale or other disposition of the works, property and facilities acquired under the provisions of this act shall be paid to the credit of the appropriate water fund.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board shall provide in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of each series of bonds, warrants, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness or in the trust indenture securing the same, for paying into the appropriate sinking fund at stated intervals all moneys then remaining in the water fund, after paying all costs of operation, maintenance and repairs of the works. All moneys in each sinking fund shall be pledged for the payment of and used for the purpose of paying the interest, principal, and the necessary fiscal agency charges upon the bonds, warrants, notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness as the same shall fall due.</p>

Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county, and in case the territory embraced in such district is located in two (2) or more counties a copy of the assessment roll as certified to by the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such district shall be delivered to the assessor of each county in which any of the land of the district is located. Upon receipt of such assessment roll the assessors of the counties embracing any of the lands of such district shall extend upon the tax roll of such county the respective amounts levied and assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land, and against each corporation as shown by said assessment roll of said district.</p>

All penalties and interest on assessments of a drainage district collected by the county treasurer shall be the property of such district, and all interest and penalties collected on assessments of such district levied for purposes other than bonded indebtedness shall be paid to the treasurer of the district levying such assessment; such payments to be made on or before the fifth day of the month following the date of such collection. In advertising property for sale for delinquent taxes the county treasurer shall show in a separate column in such advertisement the amount of unpaid drainage assessment levied against each lot, tract and easement of land in said district. The county treasurer of any county in which any portion of the land of any drainage district is located, and at the time of advertising real property for sale for state and county taxes shall include in such advertisement, the amount of delinquent drainage assessments against each lot, tract or easement of land. At the time and place of sale of real property for state and county taxes the county treasurer shall also separately sell the land for delinquent drainage district assessments and shall issue separate certificates of sale therefor. In offering such real estate for sale for drainage assessments the county treasurer shall offer the entire tract assessed and the first bid received in an amount sufficient to pay such assessment, together with interest, penalty and costs, shall be accepted and treasurer shall not attempt to secure a higher bid. In case no purchaser appears to purchase the land offered for sale for delinquent drainage assessments the treasurer shall make an entry on his delinquent tax roll "Sold to .... Drainage District of .... County, Wyoming" and shall issue a certificate of purchase to such district. The owner of any tract, lot or easement of land in a drainage district shall have the right to redeem the said land at any time within eighteen (18) months from the date of sale thereof by the county treasurer as shown on said certificate by paying therefor the amount for which said land was sold by the county treasurer, together with such penalties and interest as may be provided by law relative to sales of land for delinquent state and county taxes, and in case the owner of any lot, tract or easement of land in any district shall fail to redeem said land from said sale for drainage assessment, the county treasurer shall issue a deed therefor to the purchaser at said sale, his heirs or assigns. The drainage district purchasing such land at said sale shall have all the right of natural persons in regard to owning, holding and selling such certificate and including the receipt of a deed, holding the title to real estate and selling and disposing of the same. The commissioners shall in no case sell said land or certificate of purchase for an amount less than the amount for which said land was sold to said district, including interest thereon, unless authorized so to do by the court. The procedure for the issuing of the deed, including the form of the deed, time of publication and service of notice of intention to apply for deed, shall be the same as is now or may hereafter be provided by law for the issuances of tax deeds by the county treasurer upon the sale of land for state and county taxes, except as herein modified.</p>

                  <p>The court may, upon the petition of the commissioners, authorize them to refund any lawful indebtedness of the district now existing or which may hereafter be incurred by taking up and canceling all or a part of its outstanding notes and bonds, as fast as they become due or before, if the holders thereof will surrender the same, and issue in lieu thereof new notes or bonds of the district, payable in a time as the court deems proper, in an amount sufficient to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, together with an amount as the commissioners of the district deem necessary to provide for possible future defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments. For the purpose of providing funds to pay the refunding bonds with interest thereon, the commissioners may levy assessments against the land in the district, but not in excess of the benefits assessed. In the alternative the commissioners may, if they deem it advisable, issue refunding bonds in an amount sufficient only to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, and may, if they desire to provide a fund to provide for possible defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments, levy from year to year assessments against the land in the district for these purposes, but not in excess of the benefits assessed against the same.</p>

Until paid, all rates, tolls or charges shall constitute a perpetual lien on and against the property served, and any such lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as provided by the laws of the state of Wyoming for the foreclosure of mechanics' liens. Before any such lien is foreclosed the district shall hold a hearing thereon after notice thereof by publication and by registered first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the last known owner at his last known address according to the records of the district and the real property assessment roll in the county in which the property is located.

Upon such conveyance the district shall be dissolved and a certificate to such effect shall be signed by the clerical officer of the city or town and filed with the secretary of state and any county clerk and recorder of any county in which the order establishing the district is filed;</p>
                <p>(xxv) When two (2) or more districts are using the same or joint facilities and when the obligations of each district are fully paid or satisfied, to consolidate such districts into one (1). In such an event the consolidated district shall be under the control of a joint board consisting of the members of each board, until by the occurrence of vacancies or expiration of terms of office the board is reduced to five (5) members. Thereafter the members of the board shall be elected as provided in W.S. 41-10-112;</p>
                <p>(xxvi) If a boundary of a district is contiguous with the corporate boundary of a city or town, a district may contract with a city or town to supply water or to provide sanitary sewer or other services for which the district was organized to property within the city or town, if it is economically feasible in the opinion of the board. Any water service shall be accomplished in strict adherence with the water rights held by the district, or as such rights may be amended or enlarged under procedures of law provided in title 41 of the Wyoming statutes through the state engineer. The board may finance the extension and maintenance of the water or sewer system through revenue bonds or other means granted by law for financing the service. A one-time connection fee or system investment fee reasonably calculated to permit recovery of a proportionate share of the system infrastructure cost necessary to treat, deliver or transport the water or sewer may also be charged. A one-time fee may also be charged to recover reasonable expenses incurred by the district in determining the actual costs necessary to treat, deliver or transport the water or sewer to the point of connection. The district board may establish one (1) or more service areas outside the district in each of which an average rate may be used for all customers.

                <p>(a) Any city or town may acquire by purchase, gift or otherwise the plant facility and equipment of such district and incorporate the plant facility and equipment into its municipally owned water works or sewerage system. The city or town may finance the purchase of the plant facility and equipment by issuing its general obligation bonds or other like securities, or revenue bonds or other like securities payable solely from the revenues derived from the operation of the water or sewerage districts.

                <p>(c) When the governing body of the city or town determines to acquire by purchase, gift or otherwise the plant facilities and equipment of a district, it shall adopt an ordinance describing in a general manner the assets of the districts to be acquired, the purchase price thereof, the amount of revenue bonds proposed to be issued, the maturity or maturities, the interest rate and other details in connection with the bonds.</p>
                <p>The ordinance may provide that the bonds or those specified shall be to the extent and in the manner prescribed in the ordinance subordinated to any other bonds payable from the revenue of the water or sewerage system of the city or town. The ordinance may contain such covenants and restrictions upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds which share equally from the revenues of the system as may be necessary or advisable to assure the payment of the bonds hereby authorized. The ordinance may provide the revenue bonds or any part thereof may be sold to the state of Wyoming or the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof at private sale without advertisement for not less than par and accrued interest. The ordinance may provide that the bonds be redeemable with or without premium at the time or place the governing body provides.</p>

                  <p>c. The Chapman, Bear River, and Francis Lee Canals, which divert water from the main stem of Bear River in Wyoming to irrigate lands in both Wyoming and Utah, shall be supplied from the divertible flow allocated to the Upper Wyoming section diversions.</p>
                  <p>d. The Beckwith Quinn West Side Canal, which diverts water from the main stem of Bear River in Utah to irrigate lands in both Utah and Wyoming, shall be supplied from the divertible flow allocated to the Lower Utah section diversions.</p>
                  <p>e. If for any reason the aggregate of all diversions in a river section of the upper division does not equal the allocation of water thereto, the unused portion of such allocation shall be available for use in the other river sections in the upper division in the following order: (1) In the other river section of the same state in which the unused allocation occurs; and (2) In the river sections of the other state. No permanent right of use shall be established by the distribution of water pursuant to this paragraph e.</p>
                  <p>f. Water allocated to the several sections shall be distributed in each section in accordance with state law.</p>
                  <p>2. Central division a. When either the divertible flow as hereinafter defined for the central division is less than 870 second-feet, or the flow of the Bear River at Border Gauging Station is less than 350 second-feet, whichever shall first occur, a water emergency shall be deemed to exist in the central division and the total of all diversions in Wyoming from Grade Creek, Pine Creek, Bruner Creek and Pine Creek Springs, Spring Creek, Sublette Creek, Smiths Fork, and all the tributaries of Smiths Fork above the mouth of Hobble Creek including Hobble Creek, and from the main stem of the Bear River between Pixley Dam and the point where the river crosses the Wyoming-Idaho state line near Border shall be limited for the benefit of the state of Idaho, to not exceeding forty-three (43) percent of the divertible flow. The remaining fifty-seven (57) percent of the divertible flow shall be available for use in Idaho in the central division, but if any portion of such allocation is not used therein it shall be available for use in Idaho in the lower division.</p>
                  <p>The divertible flow for the central division shall be the total of the following three items:</p>
                  <p>(1) Diversions in second-feet in Wyoming consisting of the sum of all diversions from Grade Creek, Pine Creek, Bruner Creek and Pine Creek Springs, Spring Creek, Sublette Creek, and Smiths Fork and all the tributaries of Smiths Fork above the mouth of Hobble Creek including Hobble Creek, and the main stem of the Bear River between Pixley Dam and the point where the river crosses the Wyoming-Idaho state line near Border, Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(2) Diversions in second-feet in Idaho from the Bear River main stem from the point where the river crosses the Wyoming-Idaho state line near Border to Stewart Dam including West Fork Canal which diverts at Stewart Dam.</p>
                  <p>(3) Flow in second-feet of the Rainbow Inlet Canal and of the Bear River passing downstream from Stewart Dam.</p>
                  <p>b. The Cook Canal, which diverts water from the main stem of the Bear River in Wyoming to irrigate lands in both Wyoming and Idaho, shall be considered a Wyoming diversion and shall be supplied from the divertible flow allocated to Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>c. Water allocated to each state shall be distributed in accordance with state law.</p>
                  <p>3. Lower division a. When the flow of water across the Idaho-Utah boundary line is insufficient to satisfy water rights in Utah, covering water applied to beneficial use prior to January 1, 1976, any water user in Utah may file a petition with the commission alleging that by reason of diversions in Idaho he is being deprived of water to which he is justly entitled, and that by reason thereof, a water emergency exists, and requesting distribution of water under the direction of the commission. If the commission finds a water emergency exists, it shall put into effect water delivery schedules based on priority of rights and prepared by the commission without regard to the boundary line for all or any part of the division, and during such emergency, water shall be delivered in accordance with such schedules by the state official charged with the administration of public waters.</p>
                  <p>B. The commission shall have authority upon its own motion (1) to declare a water emergency in any or all river divisions based upon its determination that there are diversions which violate this compact and which encroach upon water rights in a lower state, (2) to make appropriate orders to prevent such encroachments, and (3) to enforce such orders by action before state administrative officials or by court proceedings.</p>
                  <p>C. When the flow of water in an interstate tributary across a state boundary line is insufficient to satisfy water rights on such tributary in a lower state, any water user may file a petition with the commission alleging that by reason of diversions in an upstream state he is being deprived of water to which he is justly entitled and that by reason thereof a water emergency exists, and requesting distribution of water under the direction of the commission. If the commission finds that a water emergency exists and that interstate control of water of such tributary is necessary, it shall put into effect water delivery schedules based on priority of rights and prepared without regard to the state boundary line. The state officials in charge of water distribution on interstate tributaries may appoint and fix the compensation and expenses of a joint water commissioner for each tributary. The proportion of the compensation and expenses to be paid by each state shall be determined by the ratio between the number of acres therein which are irrigated by diversions from such tributary, and the total number of acres irrigated from such tributary.</p>
                  <p>D. In preparing interstate water delivery schedules the commission, upon notice and after public hearings, shall make findings of fact as to the nature, priority and extent of water rights, rates of flow, duty of water, irrigated acreages, types of crops, time of use, and related matters; provided that such schedules shall recognize and incorporate therein priority of water rights as adjudicated in each of the signatory states. Such findings of fact shall, in any court or before any tribunal, constitute prima facie evidence of the facts found.</p>
                  <p>E. Water emergencies provided for herein shall terminate on September 30 of each year unless terminated sooner or extended by the commission.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V</p>
                  <p>A. Water rights in the lower division acquired under the laws of Idaho and Utah covering water applied to beneficial use prior to January 1, 1976, are hereby recognized and shall be administered in accordance with state law based on priority of rights as provided in Article IV, paragraph A.3. Rights to water first applied to beneficial use on or after January 1, 1976, shall be satisfied from the respective allocations made to Idaho and Utah in this paragraph and the water allocated to each state shall be administered in accordance with state law. Subject to the foregoing provisions, the remaining water in the lower division, including ground water tributary to the Bear River, is hereby apportioned for use in Idaho and Utah as follows:</p>
                  <p>(1) Idaho shall have the first right to the use of such remaining water resulting in an annual depletion of not more than 125,000 acre-feet;</p>
                  <p>(2) Utah shall have the second right to the use of such remaining water resulting in an annual depletion of not more than 275,000 acre-feet;</p>
                  <p>(3) Idaho and Utah shall each have an additional right to deplete annually on an equal basis, 75,000 acre-feet of the remaining water after the rights provided by subparagraphs (1), and (2) above have been satisfied;</p>
                  <p>(4) Any remaining water in the lower division after the allocations provided for in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) above have been satisfied shall be divided; thirty (30) percent to Idaho and seventy (70) percent to Utah.</p>
                  <p>B. Water allocated under the above subparagraphs shall be charged against the state in which it is used regardless of the location of the point of diversion.</p>
                  <p>C. Water depletions permitted under provisions of subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3), and (4) above, shall be calculated and administered by a commission-approved procedure.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>A. Existing storage rights in reservoirs constructed above Stewart Dam prior to February 4, 1955 are as follows:</p>
                  <p>Idaho ..................................... 324 acre-feet Utah ................................... 11,850 acre-feet Wyoming ................................. 2,150 acre-feet Additional rights are hereby granted to store in any water year above Stewart Dam, 35,500 acre-feet of Bear River water and no more under this paragraph for use in Utah and Wyoming; and to store in any water year in Idaho or Wyoming on Thomas Fork 1,000 acre-feet of water for use in Idaho. Such additional storage rights shall be subordinate to, and shall not be exercised when the effect thereof will be to impair or interfere with (1) existing direct flow rights for consumptive use in any river division and (2) existing storage rights above Stewart Dam, but shall not be subordinate to any right to store water in Bear Lake or elsewhere below Stewart Dam. One-half of the 35,500 acre-feet of additional storage right above Stewart Dam so granted to Utah and Wyoming is hereby allocated to Utah, and the remaining one-half thereof is allocated to Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>B. In addition to the rights defined in paragraph A. of this article, further storage entitlements above Stewart Dam are hereby granted. Wyoming and Utah are granted an additional right to store in any year 70,000 acre-feet of Bear River water for use in Utah and Wyoming to be divided equally; and Idaho is granted an additional right to store 4,500 acre-feet of Bear River water in Wyoming or Idaho for use in Idaho. Water rights granted under this paragraph and water appropriated, including ground water tributary to Bear River, which is applied to beneficial use on or after January 1, 1976, shall not result in an annual increase in depletion of the flow of the Bear River and its tributaries above Stewart Dam of more than 28,000 acre-feet in excess of the depletion as of January 1, 1976. Thirteen thousand (13,000) acre-feet of the additional depletion above Stewart Dam is allocated to each of Utah and Wyoming, and two thousand (2,000) acre-feet is allocated to Idaho.</p>
                  <p>The additional storage rights provided for in this paragraph shall be subordinate to, and shall not be exercised when the effect thereof will be to impair or interfere with (1) existing direct flow rights for consumptive use in any river division and (2) existing storage rights above Stewart Dam, but shall not be subordinate to any right to store water in Bear Lake or elsewhere below Stewart Dam; provided, however, there shall be no diversion of water to storage above Stewart Dam under this paragraph B. when the water surface elevation of Bear Lake is below 5,911.00 feet, Utah Power &amp; Light Company datum (the equivalent of elevation 5,913.75 feet based on the sea level datum of 1929 through the Pacific Northwest Supplementary Adjustment of 1947). Water depletions permitted under this paragraph B. shall be calculated and administered by a commission-approved procedure.</p>
                  <p>C. In addition to the rights defined in article VI, paragraphs A. and B., Idaho, Utah and Wyoming are granted the right to store and use water above Stewart Dam that otherwise would be bypassed or released from Bear Lake at times when all other direct flow and storage rights are satisfied. The availability of such water and the operation of reservoir space to store water above Bear Lake under this paragraph shall be determined by a commission-approved procedure. The storage provided for in this paragraph shall be subordinate to all other storage and direct flow rights in the Bear River. Storage rights under this paragraph shall be exercised with equal priority on the following basis: six (6) percent thereof to Idaho; forty-seven (47) percent thereof to Utah; and forty-seven (47) percent thereof to Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>D. The waters of Bear Lake below elevation 5,912.91 feet, Utah Power &amp; Light Company Bear Lake datum (the equivalent of elevation 5915.66 feet based on the sea level datum of 1929 through the Pacific Northwest Supplementary Adjustment of 1947) shall constitute a reserve for irrigation. The water of such reserve shall not be released solely for the generation of power, except in emergency, but after release for irrigation it may be used in generating power if not inconsistent with its use for irrigation. Any water in Bear Lake in excess of that constituting the irrigation reserve may be used for the generation of power or for other beneficial uses. As new reservoir capacity above the Stewart Dam is constructed to provide additional storage pursuant to paragraph A. of this article, the commission shall make a finding in writing as to the quantity of additional storage and shall thereupon make an order increasing the irrigation reserve in accordance with the following table:</p>

                  <p>It is the policy of the signatory states to encourage additional projects for the development of the water resources of the Bear River to obtain the maximum beneficial use of water with a minimum of waste, and in furtherance of such policy, authority is granted within the limitations provided by this compact, to investigate, plan, construct, and operate such projects without regard to state boundaries, provided that water rights for each such project shall, except as provided in article VI, paragraphs A. and B. thereof, be subject to rights theretofore initiated and in good standing.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
                  <p>A. No state shall deny the right of the United States of America, and subject to the conditions hereinafter contained, no state shall deny the right of another signatory state, any person or entity of another signatory state, to acquire rights to the use of water or to construct or to participate in the construction and use of diversion works and storage reservoirs with appurtenant works, canals, and conduits in one state for use of water in another state, either directly or by exchange. Water rights acquired for out-of-state use shall be appropriated in the state where the point of diversion is located in the manner provided by law for appropriation of water for use within such state.</p>
                  <p>B. Any signatory state, any person or any entity of any signatory state, shall have the right to acquire in any other signatory state such property rights as are necessary to the use of water in conformity with this compact by donation, purchase, or, as hereinafter provided through the exercise of the power of eminent domain in accordance with the law of the state in which such property is located. Any signatory state, upon the written request of the governor of any other signatory state for the benefit of whose water users property is to be acquired in the state to which such written request is made, shall proceed expeditiously to acquire the desired property either by purchase at a price acceptable to the requesting governor, or if such purchase cannot be made, then through the exercise of its power of eminent domain and shall convey such property to the requesting state or to the person, or entity designated by its governor provided, that all costs of acquisition and expenses of every kind and nature whatsoever incurred in obtaining such property shall be paid by the requesting state or the person or entity designated by its governor.</p>
                  <p>C. Should any facility be constructed in a signatory state by and for the benefit of another signatory state or persons or entities therein, as above provided, the construction, repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of such facility shall be subject to the laws of the state in which the facility is located.</p>
                  <p>D. In the event lands or other taxable facilities are acquired by a signatory state in another signatory state for the use and benefit of the former, the users of the water made available by such facilities, as a condition precedent to the use thereof, shall pay to the political subdivisions of the state in which such facilities are located, each and every year during which such rights are enjoyed for such purposes, a sum of money equivalent to the average of the amount of taxes annually levied and assessed against the land and improvements thereon during the ten years preceding the acquisition of such land. Said payments shall be in full reimbursement for the loss of taxes in such political subdivision of the state.</p>
                  <p>E. Rights to the use of water acquired under this article shall in all respects be subject to this compact.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IX</p>
                  <p>Stored water, or water from another watershed may be turned into the channel of the Bear River in one state and a like quantity, with allowance for loss by evaporation, transpiration, and seepage, may be taken out of the Bear River in another state either above or below the point where the water is turned into the channel, but in making such exchange the replacement water shall not be inferior in quality for the purpose used or diminished in quantity. Exchanges shall not be permitted if the effect thereof is to impair vested rights or to cause damage for which no compensation is paid. Water from another watershed or source which enters the Bear River by actions within a state may be claimed exclusively by that state and use thereof by that state shall not be subject to the depletion limitations of articles IV, V and VI. Proof of any claimed increase in flow shall be the burden of the state making such claim, and it shall be approved only by the unanimous vote of the commission.</p>

                  <p>(a) The major purposes of this compact are to provide for the most efficient use of the waters of the Belle Fourche River basin hereinafter referred to as the basin for multiple purposes; to provide for an equitable division of such waters; to remove all causes, present and future, which might lead to controversies; to promote interstate comity; to recognize that the most efficient utilization of the waters within the basin is required for the full development of the basin; and to promote joint action by the states and the United States in the efficient use of water and the control of floods.</p>
                  <p>(b) The physical and other conditions peculiar to the basin constitute the basis for this compact; and none of the states hereby, nor the congress of the United States by its consent, concedes that this compact establishes any general principle or precedent with respect to any other interstate stream.</p>
                  <p>(c) Either state and all others using, claiming or in any manner asserting any right to the use of the waters of the Belle Fourche River under the authority of that state, shall be subject to the terms of this compact.</p>

                  <p>(a) Wyoming and South Dakota agree that the unappropriated waters of the Belle Fourche River as of the date of this compact shall be allocated to each state as follows: Ninety percent (90%) to South Dakota Ten percent (10%) to Wyoming; provided, that allocations to Wyoming shall be exclusive of the use of these waters for domestic and stock use, and Wyoming shall be allowed unrestricted use for these purposes, except that no reservoir for such use shall exceed twenty (20) acre-feet in capacity. For storage of its allocated water, Wyoming shall have the privilege of purchasing at cost not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the total storage capacity for any reservoir or reservoirs constructed in Wyoming for irrigation of lands in South Dakota, or may construct reservoirs itself for the purpose of utilizing such water. Either state may temporarily divert, or store for beneficial use, any unused part of the above percentages allotted to the other, but no continuing right shall be established thereby.</p>
                  <p>(b) Rights to the use of the waters of the Belle Fourche River, whether based on direct diversion or storage, are hereby recognized as of the date of this compact to the extent these rights are valid under the law of the state in which the use is made, and shall remain unimpaired hereby. These rights, together with the additional allocations made under (a) of this section, are agreed to be an equitable apportionment between the states of the waters of the basin.</p>
                  <p>(c) The waters allocated under subsection (a) of this section and the rights recognized under subsection (b) of this section are hereinafter referred to collectively as the apportioned water. For the purposes of the administration of this compact and determining the apportioned water at any given date within a given calendar year, there shall be taken the sum of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The quantity of water in acre-feet that passed the Wyoming-South Dakota state line during the period from January 1 of that year to that given date;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The quantity of water in acre-feet in storage on that date in all reservoirs built in Wyoming on the Belle Fourche River subsequent to the date of this compact.</p>

                  <p>(b) Each claim hereafter initiated for storage or diversion of water in one (1) state for use in another state shall be filed in the office of the state engineer of the state in which the water is to be stored or diverted, and a duplicate copy of the application including a map showing the character and location of the proposed facilities and the lands to be irrigated shall be filed in the office of the state engineer of the state in which the water is to be used. If a portion or all the lands proposed to be reclaimed are located in a state other than the one (1) in which the water is to be restored or diverted, then, before approval of the application shall be granted, said application shall be checked against the records of the appropriate office of the state in which the water is to be used, and a notation shall be placed thereon by the officer in charge of such records to the effect that the land description does not indicate a conflict with existing water rights. All endorsements shall be placed on both the original and duplicate copies of all such maps filed to the end that the records in both states may be complete and identical.</p>
                  <p>(c) Appropriations may hereafter be adjudicated in the state in which the water is stored or diverted, and where a portion or all the lands irrigated are in the other state, such adjudications shall be confirmed in the latter state by the proper authority. Each adjudication is to conform with the laws of the state where the water is stored or diverted and shall be recorded in the county and state where the water is used.</p>

                  <p>Clarence C. Stetson, executive secretary, department of commerce, Washington, D.C.</p>
                  <p>COLORADO RIVER COMPACT</p>
                  <p>The states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, having resolved to enter into a compact under the act of the congress of the United States of America, approved August 19, 1921 (42 Statutes at Large, page 171) and the acts of legislatures of the said states, have, through their governors, appointed as their commissioners:</p>
                  <p>W. S. Norviel for the state of Arizona,</p>
                  <p>W. F. McClure for the state of California,</p>

                  <p>Stephen B. Davis, Jr., for the state of New Mexico,</p>
                  <p>R. E. Caldwell for the state of Utah,</p>
                  <p>Frank C. Emerson for the state of Wyoming, who, after negotiations participated in by Herbert Hoover, appointed by the president as the representative of the United States of America, have agreed upon the following articles:</p>
                  <p>Article I</p>
                  <p>The major purposes of this compact are to provide for the equitable division and apportionment of the use of the waters of the Colorado River system; to establish the relative importance of different beneficial uses of water; to promote interstate comity; to remove causes of present and future controversies; and to secure the expeditious agricultural and industrial development of the Colorado River basin, the storage of its waters and the protection of life and property from floods. To these ends the Colorado River basin is divided into two basins, and an apportionment of the use of part of the water of the Colorado River system is made to each of them with the provision that further equitable apportionments may be made.</p>
                  <p>Article II</p>
                  <p>(a) As used in this compact:</p>
                  <p>(i) The term "Colorado River system" means that portion of the Colorado River and its tributaries within the United States of America;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The term "Colorado River basin" means all of the drainage area of the Colorado River System, and all other territory within the United States of America to which the waters of the Colorado River system shall be beneficially applied;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The term "states of the upper division" means the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The term "states of the lower division" means the states of Arizona, California and Nevada;</p>
                  <p>(v) The term "Lee Ferry" means a point in the main stream of Colorado River one mile below the mouth of the Paria River;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The term "upper basin" means those parts of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming within and from which waters naturally drain into the Colorado River system above Lee Ferry, and also all parts of said states located without the drainage area of the Colorado River system which are now or shall hereafter be beneficially served by waters diverted from the system above Lee Ferry;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The term "lower basin" means those parts of the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah within and from which waters naturally drain into the Colorado River system below Lee Ferry, and also all parts of said states located without the drainage area of the Colorado River system which are now or shall hereafter be beneficially served by waters diverted from the system below Lee Ferry;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The term "domestic use" shall include the use of water for household, stock, municipal, mining, milling, industrial and other like purposes, but shall exclude the generation of electrical power.</p>
                  <p>Article III</p>
                  <p>(a) There is hereby apportioned from the Colorado River system in perpetuity to the upper basin and to the lower basin respectively the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of seven million five hundred thousand (7,500,000) acre-feet of water per annum, which shall include all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may not exist.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to the apportionment in paragraph (a), the lower basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by one million (1,000,000) acre-feet per annum.</p>
                  <p>(c) If, as a matter of international comity, the United States of America shall hereafter recognize in the United States of Mexico any right to the use of any waters of the Colorado River system, such waters shall be supplied first from the waters which are surplus over and above the aggregate of the quantities specified in paragraphs (a) and (b); and if such surplus shall prove insufficient for this purpose, then, the burden of such deficiency shall be equally borne by the upper basin and the lower basin, and whenever necessary the states of the upper division shall deliver at Lee Ferry water to supply one-half of the deficiency so recognized in addition to that provided in paragraph (d).</p>
                  <p>(d) The states of the upper division will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of seventy-five million (75,000,000) acre-feet for any period of ten (10) consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series, beginning with the first day of October next succeeding the ratification of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(e) The states of the upper division shall not withhold water, and the states of the lower division shall not require the delivery of water, which cannot reasonably be applied to domestic and agricultural uses.</p>
                  <p>(f) Further equitable apportionment of the beneficial uses of the waters of the Colorado River system unapportioned by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) may be made in the manner provided in paragraph (g) at any time after October first, 1963, if and when either basin shall have reached its total beneficial consumptive use as set out in paragraphs (a) and (b).</p>
                  <p>(g) In the event of a desire for a further apportionment as provided in paragraph (f) any two (2) signatory states, acting through their governors, may give joint notice of such desire to the governors of the other signatory states and to the president of the United States of America, and it shall be the duty of the governors of the signatory states and of the president of the United States of America forthwith to appoint representatives, whose duty it shall be to divide and apportion equitably between the upper basin and lower basin the beneficial use of the unapportioned water of the Colorado River System as mentioned in paragraph (f), subject to the legislative ratification of the signatory states and the congress of the United States of America.</p>
                  <p>Article IV</p>
                  <p>(a) Inasmuch as the Colorado River has ceased to be navigable for commerce and the reservation of its waters for navigation would seriously limit the development of its basin, the use of its waters for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the uses of such waters for domestic, agricultural and power purposes. If the congress shall not consent to this paragraph, the other provisions of this compact shall nevertheless remain binding.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to the provisions of this compact, water of the Colorado River system may be impounded and used for the generation of electrical power, but such impounding and use shall be subservient to the use and consumption of such water for agricultural and domestic purposes and shall not interfere with or prevent use for such dominant purposes.</p>
                  <p>(c) The provisions of this article shall not apply to or interfere with the regulation and control by any state within its boundaries of the appropriation, use and distribution of water.</p>
                  <p>Article V</p>
                  <p>(a) The chief official of each signatory state charged with the administration of water rights, together with the director of the United States reclamation service and the director of the United States geological survey shall cooperate, ex officio:</p>
                  <p>(i) To promote the systematic determination and coordination of the facts as to flow, appropriation, consumption and use of water in the Colorado River basin, and the interchange of available information in such matters.</p>
                  <p>(ii) To secure the ascertainment and publication of the annual flow of the Colorado River at Lee Ferry.</p>
                  <p>(iii) To perform such other duties as may be assigned by mutual consent of the signatories from time to time.</p>
                  <p>Article VI</p>
                  <p>(a) Should any claim or controversy arise between any two (2) or more of the signatory states: (i) with respect to the waters of the Colorado River system not covered by the terms of this compact; (ii) over the meaning or performance of any of the terms of this compact; (iii) as to the allocation of the burdens incident to the performance of any article of this compact or the delivery of waters as herein provided; (iv) as to the construction or operation of works within the Colorado River basin to be situated in two (2) or more states, or to be constructed in one (1) state for the benefit of another state; or (v) as to the diversion of water in one (1) state for the benefit of another state; the governors of the states affected, upon the request of one (1) of them, shall forthwith appoint commissioners with power to consider and adjust such claim or controversy, subject to ratification by the legislatures of the states so affected.</p>
                  <p>(b) Nothing herein contained shall prevent the adjustment of any such claim or controversy by any present method or by direct future legislative action of the interested states.</p>
                  <p>Article VII</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed as affecting the obligations of the United States of America to Indian tribes.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII</p>
                  <p>(a) Present perfected rights to the beneficial use of waters of the Colorado River system are unimpaired by this compact. Whenever storage capacity of five million (5,000,000) acre-feet shall have been provided on the main Colorado River within or for the benefit of the lower basin, then claims of such rights, if any, by appropriators or users of water in the lower basin against appropriators or users of water in the upper basin shall attach to and be satisfied from water that may be stored not in conflict with article III.</p>
                  <p>(b) All other rights to beneficial use of waters of the Colorado River system shall be satisfied solely from the water apportioned to that basin in which they are situate.</p>
                  <p>Article IX</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or prevent any state from instituting or maintaining any action or proceeding, legal or equitable, for the protection of any right under this compact or the enforcement of any of its provisions.</p>
                  <p>Article X</p>
                  <p>This compact may be terminated at any time by the unanimous agreement of the signatory states. In the event of such termination all rights established under it shall continue unimpaired.</p>
                  <p>Article XI</p>
                  <p>This compact shall become binding and obligatory when it shall have been approved by the legislatures of each of the signatory states and by the congress of the United States.</p>
                  <p>Notice of approval by the legislatures shall be given by the governor of each signatory state to the governors of the other signatory states and to the president of the United States, and the president of the United States is requested to give notice to the governors of the signatory states of approval by the congress of the United States.</p>
                  <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the commissioners have signed this compact in a single original, which shall be deposited in the archives of the department of state of the United States of America and of which a duly certified copy shall be forwarded to the governor of each of the signatory states.</p>
                  <p>Done at the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, this twenty-fourth day of November, A.D. one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two.</p>

                  <p>(iii) No state shall exceed its apportioned use in any water year when the effect of such excess use, as determined by the commission, is to deprive another signatory state of its apportioned use during that water year; provided, that this subparagraph (b)(iii) shall not be construed as:</p>
                  <p>(A) Altering the apportionment of use, or obligations to make deliveries as provided in articles XI, XII, XIII or XIV of this compact;</p>
                  <p>(B) Purporting to apportion among the signatory states such uses of water as the upper basin may be entitled to under paragraphs (f) and (g) of article III of the Colorado River Compact; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Countenancing average uses by any signatory state in excess of its apportionment.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The apportionment to each state includes all water necessary for the supply of any rights which now exist.</p>
                  <p>(c) No apportionment is hereby made, or intended to be made, of such uses of water as the upper basin may be entitled to under paragraphs (f) and (g) of article III of the Colorado River Compact.</p>
                  <p>(d) The apportionment made by this article shall not be taken as any basis for the allocation among the signatory states of any benefits resulting from the generation of power.</p>
                  <p>Article IV</p>
                  <p>(a) In the event curtailment of use of water by the states of the upper division at any time shall become necessary in order that the flow at Lee Ferry shall not be depleted below that required by article III of the Colorado River Compact, the extent of curtailment by each state of the consumptive use of water apportioned to it by article III of this compact shall be in such quantities and at such times as shall be determined by the commission upon the application of the following principles:</p>
                  <p>(i) The extent and times of curtailment shall be such as to assure full compliance with article III of the Colorado River Compact;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any state or states of the upper division, in the ten (10) years immediately preceding the water year in which curtailment is necessary, shall have consumptively used more water than it was or they were, as the case may be, entitled to use under the apportionment made by article III of this compact, such state or states shall be required to supply at Lee Ferry a quantity of water equal to its, or the aggregate of their, overdraft or the proportionate part of such overdraft, as may be necessary to assure compliance with article III of the Colorado River Compact, before demand is made on any other state of the upper division;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this article, the extent of curtailment by each state of the upper division of the consumptive use of water apportioned to it by article III of this compact shall be such as to result in the delivery at Lee Ferry of a quantity of water which bears the same relation to the total required curtailment of use by the states of the upper division as the consumptive use of upper Colorado River system water which was made by each such state during the water year immediately preceding the year in which the curtailment becomes necessary bears to the total consumptive use of such water in the states of the upper division during the same water year; provided, that in determining such relation the uses of water under rights perfected prior to November 24, 1922, shall be excluded.</p>
                  <p>Article V</p>
                  <p>(a) All losses of water occurring from or as the result of the storage of water in reservoirs constructed prior to the signing of this compact shall be charged to the state in which such reservoir or reservoirs are located. Water stored in reservoirs covered by this paragraph (a) shall be for the exclusive use of and shall be charged to the state in which the reservoir or reservoirs are located.</p>
                  <p>(b) All losses of water occurring from or as the result of the storage of water in reservoirs constructed after the signing of this compact shall be charged as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the commission finds that the reservoir is used, in whole or in part, to assist the states of the upper division in meeting their obligations to deliver water at Lee Ferry imposed by article III of the Colorado River Compact, the commission shall make findings, which in no event shall be contrary to the laws of the United States of America under which any reservoir is constructed, as to the reservoir capacity allocated for that purpose. The whole or that proportion, as the case may be, of reservoir losses as found by the commission to be reasonably and properly chargeable to the reservoir or reservoir capacity utilized to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry shall be charged to the states of the upper division in the proportion which the consumptive use of water in each state of the upper division during the water year in which the charge is made bears to the total consumptive use of water in all states of the upper division during the same water year. Water stored in reservoirs or in reservoir capacity covered by this subparagraph (b)(i) shall be for the common benefit of all of the states of the upper division.</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the commission finds that the reservoir is used, in whole or in part, to supply water for use in a state of the upper division, the commission shall make findings, which in no event shall be contrary to the laws of the United States of America under which any reservoir is constructed, as to the reservoir or reservoir capacity utilized to supply water for use and the state in which such water will be used. The whole or that proportion, as the case may be, of reservoir losses as found by the commission to be reasonably and properly chargeable to the state in which such water will be used shall be borne by that state. As determined by the commission, water stored in reservoirs covered by this subparagraph (b)(ii) shall be earmarked for and charged to the state in which the water will be used.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event the commission finds that a reservoir site is available both to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry and to store water for consumptive use in a state of the upper division, the storage of water for consumptive use shall be given preference. Any reservoir or reservoir capacity hereafter used to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry shall by order of the commission be used to store water for consumptive use in a state, provided the commission finds that such storage is reasonably necessary to permit such state to make the use of the water apportioned to it by this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article VI</p>
                  <p>The commission shall determine the quantity of the consumptive use of water, which use is apportioned by article III hereof, for the upper basin and for each state of the upper basin by the inflow-outflow method in terms of man-made depletions of the virgin flow at Lee Ferry, unless the commission, by unanimous action, shall adopt a different method of determination.</p>
                  <p>Article VII</p>
                  <p>The consumptive use of water by the United States of America or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or wards shall be charged as a use by the state in which the use is made; provided, that such consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding, or conveyance of water in one state for use in another shall be charged to such latter state.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII</p>
                  <p>(a) There is hereby created an interstate administrative agency to be known as the "Upper Colorado River Commission".

The president is hereby requested to designate a commissioner. If so designated the commissioner representing the United States of America shall be the presiding officer of the commission and shall be entitled to the same powers and rights as the commissioner of any state. Any four (4) members of the commission shall constitute a quorum.</p>
                  <p>(b) The salaries and personal expenses of each commissioner shall be paid by the government which he represents. All other expenses which are incurred by the commission incident to the administration of this compact, and which are not paid by the United States of America, shall be borne by the four (4) states according to the percentage of consumptive use apportioned to each. On or before December 1 of each year, the commission shall adopt and transmit to the governors of the four (4) states and to the president a budget covering an estimate of its expenses for the following year, and of the amount payable by each state. Each state shall pay the amount due by it to the commission on or before April 1 of the year following. The payment of the expenses of the commission and of its employees shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedures of any of the four (4) states; however, all receipt and disbursement of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified independent public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall appoint a secretary, who shall not be a member of the commission, or an employee of any signatory state or of the United States of America while so acting. He shall serve for such term and receive such salary and perform such duties as the commission may direct. The commission may employ such engineering, legal, clerical and other personnel as, in its judgment, may be necessary for the performance of its functions under this compact. In the hiring of employees, the commission shall not be bound by the civil service laws of any state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission, so far as consistent with this compact, shall have the power to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Adopt rules and regulations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Locate, establish, construct, abandon, operate and maintain water gauging stations;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Make estimates to forecast water run-off on the Colorado River and any of its tributaries;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Engage in cooperative studies of water supplies of the Colorado River and its tributaries;</p>

                  <p>(vi) Make findings as to the quantity of water of the upper Colorado River system used each year in the upper Colorado River basin and in each state thereof;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Make findings as to the quantity of water deliveries at Lee Ferry during each water year;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Make findings as to the necessity for and the extent of the curtailment of use, required, if any, pursuant to article IV hereof;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Make findings as to the quantity of reservoir losses and as to the share thereof chargeable under article V hereof to each of the states;</p>
                  <p>(x) Make findings of fact in the event of the occurrence of extraordinary drought or serious accident to the irrigation system in the upper basin, whereby deliveries by the upper basin of water which it may be required to deliver in order to aid in fulfilling obligations of the United States of America to the United Mexican States arising under the treaty between the United States of America and the United Mexican States, dated February 3, 1944 (Treaty Series 994) become difficult, and report such findings to the governors of the upper basin states, the president of the United States of America, the United States section of the international boundary and water commission, and such other federal officials and agencies as it may deem appropriate to the end that the water allotted to Mexico under division III of such treaty may be reduced in accordance with the terms of such treaty;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Acquire and hold such personal and real property as may be necessary for the performance of its duties hereunder and to dispose of the same when no longer required;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Perform all functions required of it by this compact and do all things necessary, proper or convenient in the performance of its duties hereunder, either independently or in cooperation with any state or federal agency;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Make and transmit annually to the governors of the signatory states and the president of the United States of America, with the estimated budget, a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding water year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided in this compact the concurrence of four members of the commission shall be required in any action taken by it.</p>
                  <p>(f) The commission and its secretary shall make available to the governor of each of the signatory states any information within its possession at any time, and shall always provide free access to its records by the governors of each of the states, or their representatives, or authorized representatives of the United States of America.</p>
                  <p>(g) Findings of fact made by the commission shall not be conclusive in any court, or before any agency or tribunal, but shall constitute prima facie evidence of the facts found.</p>
                  <p>(h) The organization meeting of the commission shall be held within four (4) months from the effective date of this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article IX</p>
                  <p>(a) No state shall deny the right of the United States of America and, subject to the conditions hereinafter contained, no state shall deny the right of another signatory state, any person, or entity of any signatory state to acquire rights to the use of water, or to construct or participate in the construction and use of diversion works and storage reservoirs with appurtenant works, canals and conduits in one (1) state for the purpose of diverting, conveying, storing, regulating and releasing water to satisfy the provisions of the Colorado River Compact relating to the obligation of the states of the upper division to make deliveries of water at Lee Ferry, or for the purpose of diverting, conveying, storing or regulating water in any upper signatory state for consumptive use in a lower signatory state, when such use is within the apportionment to such lower state made by this compact. Such rights shall be subject to the rights of water users, in a state in which such reservoir or works are located, to receive and use water, the use of which is within the apportionment to such state by this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any signatory state, any person or any entity of any signatory state shall have the right to acquire such property rights as are necessary to the use of water in conformity with this compact in any other signatory state by donation, purchase or through the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Any signatory state, upon the written request of the governor of any other signatory state, for the benefit of whose water users property is to be acquired in the state to which such written request is made, shall proceed expeditiously to acquire the desired property either by purchase at a price satisfactory to the requesting state, or, if such purchase cannot be made, then through the exercise of its power of eminent domain and shall convey such property to the requesting state or such entity as may be designated by the requesting state; provided, that all costs of acquisition and expenses of every kind and nature whatsoever incurred in obtaining the requested property shall be paid by the requesting state at the time and in the manner prescribed by the state requested to acquire the property.</p>
                  <p>(c) Should any facility be constructed in a signatory state by and for the benefit of another signatory state or states or the water users thereof, as above provided, the construction, repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of such facility shall be subject to the laws of the state in which the facility is located, except that, in the case of a reservoir constructed in one state for the benefit of another state or states, the water administration officials of the state in which the facility is located shall permit the storage and release of any water which, as determined by findings of the commission, falls within the apportionment of the state or states for whose benefit the facility is constructed. In the case of a regulating reservoir for the joint benefit of all states in making Lee Ferry deliveries, the water administration officials of the state in which the facility is located, in permitting the storage and release of water, shall comply with the findings and orders of the commission.</p>
                  <p>(d) In the event property is acquired by a signatory state in another signatory state for the use and benefit of the former, the users of water made available by such facilities, as a condition precedent to the use thereof, shall pay to the political subdivisions of the state in which such works are located, each and every year during which such rights are enjoyed for such purposes, a sum of money equivalent to the average annual amount of taxes levied and assessed against the land and improvements thereon during the ten (10) years preceding the acquisition of such land. Said payments shall be in full reimbursement for the loss of taxes in such political subdivisions of the state, and in lieu of any and all taxes on said property, improvements and rights. The signatory states recommend to the president and the congress that, in the event the United States of America shall acquire property in one of the signatory states for the benefit of another signatory state, or its water users, provision be made for like payment in reimbursement of loss of taxes.</p>
                  <p>Article X</p>
                  <p>(a) The signatory states recognize La Plata River Compact entered into between the states of Colorado and New Mexico, dated November 27, 1922, approved by the congress on January 29, 1925 (43 Stat. 796), and this compact shall not affect the apportionment therein made.</p>
                  <p>(b) All consumptive use of water of La Plata River and its tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of article III hereof to the state in which the use is made; provided, that consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one state for use in the other shall be charged to the latter state.</p>
                  <p>Article XI</p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of this compact, the consumptive use of the water of the Little Snake River and its tributaries is hereby apportioned between the states of Colorado and Wyoming in such quantities as shall result from the application of the following principles and procedures:</p>
                  <p>(i) Water Used Under Rights Existing Prior to the Signing of This Compact:</p>
                  <p>(A) Water diverted from any tributary of the Little Snake River or from the main stem of the Little Snake River above a point one hundred (100) feet below the confluence of Savery Creek and the Little Snake River shall be administered without regard to rights covering the diversion of water from any downstream points.</p>
                  <p>(B) Water diverted from the main stem of the Little Snake River below a point one hundred (100) feet below the confluence of Savery Creek and the Little Snake River shall be administered on the basis of an interstate priority schedule prepared by the commission in conformity with priority dates established by the laws of the respective states.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Water Used Under Rights Initiated Subsequent to the Signing of This Compact:</p>
                  <p>(A) Direct flow diversions shall be so administered that, in time of shortage, the curtailment of use on each acre of land irrigated thereunder shall be as nearly equal as may be possible in both of the states.</p>
                  <p>(B) The storage of water by projects located in either state, whether of supplemental supply or of water used to irrigate land not irrigated at the date of the signing of this compact, shall be so administered that in times of water shortage the curtailment of storage water available for each acre of land irrigated thereunder shall be as nearly equal as may be possible in both states.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Water uses under the apportionment made by this article shall be in accordance with the principle that beneficial use shall be the basis, measure and limit of the right to use.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The states of Colorado and Wyoming each assent to diversions and storage of water in one (1) state for use in the other state, subject to compliance with article IX of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(v) In the event of the importation of water to the Little Snake River basin from any other river basin, the state making the importation shall have the exclusive use of such imported water unless by written agreement, made by the representatives of the states of Colorado and Wyoming on the commission, it is otherwise provided.</p>
                  <p>(vi) Water use projects initiated after the signing of this compact, to the greatest extent possible, shall permit the full use within the basin in the most feasible manner of the waters of the Little Snake River and its tributaries, without regard to the state line; and, so far as is practicable, shall result in an equal division between the states of the use of water not used under rights existing prior to the signing of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(vii) All consumptive use of the waters of the Little Snake River and its tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of article III hereof to the state in which the use is made; provided, that consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one (1) state for use in the other shall be charged to the latter state.</p>
                  <p>Article XII</p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of this compact, the consumptive use of the waters of Henry's Fork, a tributary of Green River originating in the state of Utah and flowing into the state of Wyoming and thence into the Green River in the state of Utah; Beaver Creek, originating in the state of Utah and flowing into Henry's Fork in the state of Wyoming; Burnt Fork, a tributary of Henry's Fork, originating in the state of Utah and flowing into Henry's Fork in the state of Wyoming; Birch Creek, a tributary of Henry's Fork originating in the state of Utah and flowing into Henry's Fork in the state of Wyoming; and Sheep Creek, a tributary of Green River in the state of Utah, and their tributaries, are hereby apportioned between the states of Utah and Wyoming in such quantities as will result from the application of the following principles and procedures:</p>
                  <p>(i) Waters diverted from Henry's Fork, Beaver Creek, Burnt Fork, Birch Creek and their tributaries, shall be administered without regard to the state line on the basis of an interstate priority schedule to be prepared by the states affected and approved by the commission in conformity with the actual priority of right of use, the water requirements of the land irrigated and the acreage irrigated in connection therewith.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Waters used under rights from Henry's Fork, Beaver Creek, Burnt Fork, Birch Creek and their tributaries, initiated after the signing of this compact shall be divided fifty percent (50%) to the state of Wyoming and fifty percent (50%) to the state of Utah and each state may use said waters as and where it deems advisable.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The state of Wyoming assents to the exclusive use by the state of Utah of the water of Sheep Creek, except that the lands, if any, presently irrigated in the state of Wyoming from the water of Sheep Creek shall be supplied with water from Sheep Creek in order of priority and in such quantities as are in conformity with the laws of the state of Utah.</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the event of the importation of water to Henry's Fork, or any of its tributaries, from any other river basin, the state making the importation shall have the exclusive use of such imported water unless by written agreement made by the representatives of the states of Utah and Wyoming on the commission, it is otherwise provided.</p>
                  <p>(v) All consumptive use of waters of Henry's Fork, Beaver Creek, Burnt Fork, Birch Creek, Sheep Creek, and their tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of article III hereof to the state in which the use is made; provided, that consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one (1) state for use in the other shall be charged to the latter state.</p>
                  <p>(vi) The states of Utah and Wyoming each assent to the diversion and storage of water in one (1) state for use in the other state, subject to compliance with article IX of this compact. It shall be the duty of the water administrative officials of the state where the water is stored to release said stored water to the other state upon demand. If either the state of Utah or the state of Wyoming shall construct a reservoir in the other state for use in its own state, the water users of the state in which said facilities are constructed may purchase at cost a portion of the capacity of said reservoir sufficient for the irrigation of their lands thereunder.</p>
                  <p>(vii) In order to measure the flow of water diverted, each state shall cause suitable measuring devices to be constructed, maintained and operated at or near the point of diversion into each ditch.</p>
                  <p>(viii) The state engineers of the two (2) states jointly shall appoint a special water commissioner who shall have authority to administer the water in both states in accordance with the terms of this article. The salary and expenses of such special water commissioner shall be paid, thirty percent (30%) by the state of Utah and seventy percent (70%) by the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>Article XIII</p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of this compact, the rights to the consumptive use of the water of the Yampa River, a tributary entering the Green River in the state of Colorado, are hereby apportioned between the states of Colorado and Utah in accordance with the following principles:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state of Colorado will not cause the flow of the Yampa River at the Maybell Gaging Station to be depleted below an aggregate of five million (5,000,000) acre-feet for any period of ten (10) consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series beginning with the first day of October next succeeding the ratification and approval of this compact. In the event any diversion is made from the Yampa River or from tributaries entering the Yampa River above the Maybell Gaging Station for the benefit of any water use project in the state of Utah, then the gross amount of all such diversions for use in the state of Utah, less any returns from such diversions to the river above Maybell, shall be added to the actual flow at the Maybell Gaging Station to determine the total flow at the Maybell Gaging Station.</p>
                  <p>(ii) All consumptive use of the waters of the Yampa River and its tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of article III hereof to the state in which the use is made; provided, that consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one (1) state for use in the other shall be charged to the latter state.</p>
                  <p>Article XIV</p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of this compact, the consumptive use of the waters of the San Juan River and its tributaries is hereby apportioned between the states of Colorado and New Mexico as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state of Colorado agrees to deliver to the state of New Mexico from the San Juan River and its tributaries which rise in the state of Colorado a quantity of water which shall be sufficient, together with water originating in the San Juan basin in the state of New Mexico, to enable the state of New Mexico to make full use of the water apportioned to the state of New Mexico by article III of this compact, subject however, to the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) A first and prior right shall be recognized as to:</p>
                  <p>(I) All uses of water made in either state at the time of the signing of this compact; and</p>
                  <p>(II) All uses of water contemplated by projects authorized, at the time of the signing of this compact, under the laws of the United States of America whether or not such projects are eventually constructed by the United States of America or by some other entity.</p>
                  <p>(B) The state of Colorado assents to diversions and storage of water in the state of Colorado for use in the state of New Mexico, subject to compliance with article IX of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(C) The uses of the waters of the San Juan River and any of its tributaries within either state which are dependent upon a common source of water and which are not covered by (A) hereof, shall in times of water shortages be reduced in such quantity that the resulting consumptive use in each state will bear the same proportionate relation to the consumptive use made in each state during times of average water supply as determined by the commission; provided, that any preferential uses of water to which Indians are entitled under article XIX shall be excluded in determining the amount of curtailment to be made under this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(D) The curtailment of water use by either state in order to make deliveries at Lee Ferry as required by article IV of this compact shall be independent of any and all conditions imposed by this article and shall be made by each state, as and when required, without regard to any provision of this article.</p>
                  <p>(E) All consumptive use of the waters of the San Juan River and its tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of article III hereof to the state in which the use is made; provided, that consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one (1) state for use in the other shall be charged to the latter state.</p>
                  <p>Article XV</p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of the Colorado River Compact and of this compact, water of the upper Colorado River system may be impounded and used for the generation of electrical power, but such impounding and use shall be subservient to the use and consumption of such water for agricultural and domestic purposes and shall not interfere with or prevent use for such dominant purposes.</p>
                  <p>(b) The provisions of this compact shall not apply to or interfere with the right or power of any signatory state to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use and control of water, the consumptive use of which is apportioned and available to such state by this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article XVI</p>
                  <p>The failure of any state to use the water, or any part thereof, the use of which is apportioned to it under the terms of this compact, shall not constitute a relinquishment of the right to such use to the lower basin or to any other state, nor shall it constitute a forfeiture or abandonment of the right to such use.</p>
                  <p>Article XVII</p>
                  <p>The use of any water now or hereafter imported into the natural drainage basin of the upper Colorado River system shall not be charged to any state under the apportionment of consumptive use made by this compact.</p>

                  <p>Article XIX</p>

                  <p>Article I</p>
                  <p>(a) The major purposes of this compact are to provide for the most efficient use of waters of the Snake River for multiple purposes; to provide for equitable division of such waters; to remove causes of present and future controversies; to promote interstate comity; to recognize that the most efficient utilization of such waters is required for the development of the drainage area of the Snake River and its tributaries in Wyoming and Idaho; and to promote joint action by the states and the United States in the development and use of such waters and the control of floods.</p>
                  <p>(b) Either state using, claiming or in any manner asserting any right to the use of the waters of the Snake River under the authority of either state shall be subject to the terms of this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article II</p>
                  <p>(a) As used in this compact:</p>
                  <p>(i) The term "Snake River" as distinguished from terms such as "Snake River and its tributaries" shall mean the Snake River from its headwaters to the Wyoming-Idaho boundary and all tributaries flowing into it within the boundaries of Wyoming, and the Salt River and all its tributaries;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The terms "Idaho" and "Wyoming" shall mean, respectively, the state of Idaho and the state of Wyoming, and, except as otherwise expressly provided, either of those terms or the term "state" or "states" used in relation to any right or obligation created or recognized by this compact shall include any person or entity of any nature whatsoever, including the United States;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The term "domestic use" shall mean the use of water by an individual, or by a family unit or household for drinking, cooking, laundering, sanitation and other personal comforts and necessities; and for the irrigation of a family garden or orchard not exceeding one-half acre in area;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The term "stock water use" shall mean the use of water for livestock and poultry;</p>
                  <p>(v) The term "established Wyoming rights" shall mean Snake River water rights that have been validly established of record in Wyoming prior to July 1, 1949, for use in Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>Article III</p>
                  <p>(a) The waters of the Snake River, exclusive of established Wyoming rights and other uses coming within the provisions of (c) of this article III, are hereby allocated to each state for storage or direct diversion as follows:</p>
                  <p>To Idaho .................... ninety-six percent (96%) To Wyoming ......................... four percent (4%) subject to the following stipulations and conditions as to the four percent (4%) allocated to Wyoming:</p>
                  <p>(i) One-half may be used in Wyoming by direct diversion or by storage and subsequent diversion without provision being made for replacement storage space;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The other one-half may be diverted for direct use or stored for later diversion and use on the condition that there shall have been provided for reimbursement of Idaho users replacement storage space to the extent of one-third of the maximum annual diversion in acre-feet but not in excess, however, of one-third of half the total hereby allocated to Wyoming. Until this total replacement storage space has been made available, provision for meeting its proportionate part of this total shall be a prerequisite to the right to use water in Wyoming for any irrigation project authorized after June 30, 1949, for construction by any federal agency.</p>
                  <p>(b) The amount of water subject to allocation as provided in (a) of this article III shall be determined on an annual water-year basis measured from October 1 of any year through September 30 of the succeeding year. The quantity of water to which the percentage factors in (a) of this article III shall be applied through a given date in any water year shall be, in acre-feet, equal to the algebraic sum of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The quantity of water, in acre-feet, that has passed the Wyoming state line in the Snake River to the given date, determined on the basis of gaging stations to be established at such points as are agreed on under the provisions of (b) of article VI;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The change during that water year to the given date in quantity of water, in acre-feet, in any existing or future reservoirs in Wyoming which water is for use in Idaho;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The quantity of water, in acre-feet, stored in that water year and in storage on the given date for later diversion and use in Wyoming, under rights having a priority later than June 30, 1949;</p>
                  <p>(iv) One-third of the quantity of water, in acre-feet, excluding any storage water held over from prior years, diverted, under rights having a priority later than June 30, 1949, in that water year to the given date:</p>
                  <p>(A) from the Snake River for use that year on lands in Wyoming; and</p>
                  <p>(B) from tributaries of the Salt River for use that year on lands in Idaho.</p>
                  <p>(c) (i) There are hereby excluded from the allocations made by this compact:</p>
                  <p>(A) Existing and future domestic and stock water uses of water; provided, that the capacity of any reservoir for stock water shall not exceed twenty (20) acre-feet;</p>
                  <p>(B) Established Wyoming rights; and</p>
                  <p>(C) All water rights for use in Idaho on any tributary of the Salt River heading in Idaho which were validly established under the laws of Idaho prior to July 1, 1949;</p>
                  <p>(ii) and all such uses and rights are hereby recognized.</p>
                  <p>Article IV</p>
                  <p>No water of the Snake River shall be diverted in Wyoming for use outside the drainage area of the Snake River except with the approval of Idaho; and no water of any tributary of the Salt River heading in Idaho shall be diverted in Idaho for use outside the drainage area of said tributary except with the approval of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>Article V</p>
                  <p>Subject to the provisions of this compact, waters of the Snake River may be impounded and used for the generation of electrical power, but such impounding and use shall be subservient to the use of such waters for domestic, stock and irrigation purposes, and shall not interfere with or prevent their use for such preferred purposes. Water impounded or diverted in Wyoming exclusively for the generation of electrical power shall not be charged to the allocation set forth in article III of this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article VI</p>
                  <p>(a) It shall be the duty of the two (2) states to administer this compact through the official in each state who is now or may hereafter be charged with the administration of the public water supplies, and to collect and correlate through such officials the data necessary for the proper administration of the provisions of this compact. Such officials may, by unanimous action, adopt rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) The states shall in conjunction with other responsible agencies cause to be established, maintained and operated such suitable water gaging stations as they find necessary to administer this compact. The United States geological survey, or whatever federal agency may succeed to the functions and duties of that agency, so far as this compact is concerned, shall collaborate with officials of the states charged with the administration of this compact in the execution of the duty of such officials in the collection, correlation and publication of information necessary for its proper administration.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the case of failure of the administrative officials of the two (2) states to agree on any matter necessary to the administration of this compact, the director of the United States geological survey, or whatever official succeeds to his duties, shall be asked to appoint a federal representative to participate as to the matters in disagreement, and points of disagreement shall be decided by majority vote.</p>
                  <p>Article VII</p>
                  <p>(a) Either state shall have the right to file applications for and receive permits to construct or participate in the construction and use of any dam, storage reservoir or diversion works in the other state for the purpose of conserving and regulating its allocated water and to perfect rights thereto. Either state exercising this right shall comply with the laws of the other state except as to any general requirement for legislative approval that may be applicable to the granting of rights by one (1) state for the diversion or storage of water for use outside of that state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each claim or right hereafter initiated for storage or diversion of water in one state for use in the other state shall be filed in the office of the proper official of the state in which the water is to be stored or diverted, and a duplicate copy of the application, including a map showing the character and location of the proposed facilities and the lands to be irrigated, shall be filed in the office of the proper official of the state in which the water is to be used. If a portion or all the lands proposed to be reclaimed are located in a state other than the one in which the water is to be stored or diverted, then, before approval, said application shall be checked against the records of the office of the state in which the water is to be used, and a notation shall be placed thereon by the officer in charge of such records as to whether or not he approves the application. All endorsements shall be placed on both the original and duplicate copies of all such applications and maps filed to the end that the records in both states may be complete and identical.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII</p>
                  <p>(a) Neither state shall deny the right of the United States, and, subject to the conditions hereinafter contained, neither state shall deny the right of the other state to acquire rights to the use of water, or to construct or participate in the construction and use of diversion works and storage reservoirs with appurtenant works, canals and conduits in one (1) state for the purpose of diverting, conveying, storing or regulating water in one (1) state for use in the other state, when such use is within the allocation to such state made by this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) Either state shall have the right to acquire such property rights as are necessary to the use of water in conformity with this compact in the other state by donation, purchase or through the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Either state, upon the written request of the governor of the other state, for the benefit of whose water users' property is to be acquired in the state to which such written request is made, shall proceed expeditiously to acquire the desired property either by purchase at a price satisfactory to the requesting state, or, if such purchase cannot be made, then through the exercise of its power of eminent domain and shall convey such property to the requesting state or such entity as may be designated by the requesting state; provided, that all costs of acquisition and expenses of every kind and nature whatsoever incurred in obtaining the requested property shall be paid by the requesting state at the time and in the manner prescribed by the state requested to acquire the property.</p>
                  <p>(c) Should any facility be constructed in either state by and for the benefit of the other state, as above provided, the construction, repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of such facility shall be subject to the laws of the state in which the facility is located, except that, in the case of a reservoir constructed in either state for the benefit of the other state, the proper officials of the state in which the facility is located shall permit the storage and release of any water to which the other state is entitled under this compact.</p>
                  <p>(d) Either state having property rights in the other state acquired as provided in (b) of this article VIII shall pay to the political subdivisions of the state in which such property rights are located, each and every year during which such rights are held, a sum of money equivalent to the average annual amount of taxes assessed against those rights during the ten (10) years preceding the acquisition of such rights in reimbursement for the loss of taxes to said political subdivision of the state, except that this provision shall not be applicable to interests in property rights the legal title to which is in the United States. Payments so made to a political subdivision shall be in lieu of any and all taxes by that subdivision on the property rights for which the payments are made.</p>
                  <p>Article IX</p>
                  <p>The provisions of this compact shall not apply to or interfere with the right or power of either state to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use and control of waters allocated to such state by this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article X</p>
                  <p>The failure of either state to use the waters, or any part thereof, the use of which is allocated to it under the terms of this compact, shall not constitute a relinquishment of the right to such use to the other state, nor shall it constitute a forfeiture or abandonment of the right to such use.</p>
                  <p>Article XI</p>
                  <p>In case any reservoir is constructed in one (1) state where the water is to be used principally in the other state, sufficient water not to exceed five (5) cubic feet per second shall be released at all times, if necessary for stock water use and conservation of fish and wildlife.</p>
                  <p>Article XII</p>
                  <p>The provisions of this compact shall remain in full force and effect unless amended or terminated by action of the legislatures of both states and consented to and approved by the congress of the United States in the same manner as this compact is required to be ratified and approved to become effective; provided, that in the event of such amendment or termination all rights theretofore established hereunder or recognized hereby shall continue to be recognized as valid by both states notwithstanding such amendment or termination.</p>
                  <p>Article XIII</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or prevent either state from instituting or maintaining any action or proceeding, legal or equitable, for the protection of any right under this compact or the enforcement of any of its provisions.</p>
                  <p>Article XIV</p>
                  <p>(a) Nothing in this compact shall be deemed:</p>
                  <p>(i) To affect adversely any rights to the use of the waters of the Snake River, including its tributaries entering downstream from the Wyoming-Idaho state line, owned by or for Indians, Indian tribes and their reservations. The water required to satisfy these rights shall be charged against the allocation made to the state in which the Indians and their lands are located;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To impair or affect any rights or powers of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, in and to the use of the waters of the Snake River nor its capacity to acquire rights in and to the use of said waters;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To apply to any waters within the Yellowstone National Park or Grand Teton National Park;</p>
                  <p>(iv) To subject any property of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities to taxation by either state or subdivisions thereof, nor to create an obligation on the part of the United States, its agents or instrumentalities, by reason of the acquisition, construction or operation of any property or works of whatsoever kind, to make any payments to any state or political subdivisions thereof, state agency, municipality or entity whatsoever in reimbursement for the loss of taxes;</p>
                  <p>(v) To subject any works of the United States used in connection with the control or use of waters which are the subject of this compact to the laws of any state to an extent other than the extent to which these laws would apply without regard to this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) of this article, any beneficial uses hereafter made by the United States, or those acting by or under its authority, within either state, of the waters allocated by this compact shall be within the allocations hereinabove made for use in that state and shall be taken into account in determining the extent of use within that state.</p>
                  <p>Article XV</p>
                  <p>This compact shall become operative when approved by legislative enactment by each of the states, and when consented to by the congress of the United States.</p>
                  <p>Article XVI</p>
                  <p>Wyoming hereby relinquishes the right to the allocation of stored water in Grassy Lake Reservoir, as set forth in Wyoming's reservoir permit No. 4631 Res. and evidenced by certificate No. R-1, page 318, and all claims predicated thereon.</p>
                  <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF the commissioners have signed this compact in quadruplicate, one (1) of which shall be filed in the archives of the department of state of the United States of America and shall be deemed the authoritative original, and of which a duly certified copy shall be forwarded to the governor of each of the states.</p>
                  <p>Done at the city of Cheyenne, in the state of Wyoming, this 10th day of October, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and forty-nine.</p>

                  <p>(a) The major purposes of this compact are to provide for an equitable division or apportionment of the available surface waters supply of the upper Niobrara River basin between the states; to provide for obtaining information or groundwater and underground water flow necessary for apportioning the underground flow by supplement to this compact; to remove all causes, present and future which might lead to controversies; and to promote interstate comity.</p>
                  <p>(b) The physical and other conditions peculiar to the upper Niobrara River basin constitute the basis for this compact, and neither of the states hereby concedes that this compact establishes any general principle or precedent with respect to any other interstate stream.</p>
                  <p>(c) Either state and all others using, claiming or in any other manner asserting any right to the use of the waters of the Niobrara River basin under the authority of that state, shall be subject to the terms of this compact.</p>

                  <p>(c) Where the name of a state or the term "state" or "states" is used, they shall be construed to include any person or entity of any nature whatsoever using, claiming, or in any manner asserting any right to the use of the waters of the Niobrara River under the authority of that state.</p>
                  <p>Article III</p>
                  <p>(a) It shall be the duty of the two (2) states to administer this compact through the official in each state who is now or may hereafter be charged with the duty of administering the public water supplies, and to collect and correlate through such officials the data necessary for the proper administration of the provisions of this compact. Such officials may, by unanimous action, adopt rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) The states agree that the United States geological survey, or whatever federal agency may succeed to the functions and duties of that agency, insofar as this compact is concerned, may collaborate with the officials of the states charged with the administration of this compact in the execution of the duty of such officials in the collection, correlation, and publication of information necessary for the proper administration of this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article IV</p>

Where water is pumped from such storage reservoirs, the quantity of storage water pumped or otherwise diverted for irrigation purposes or other beneficial purposes from any such reservoir in any water year shall be limited to the capacity of such reservoir as shown by the records of the Wyoming state engineer's office, unless additional storage water becomes available during the period June 1 to September 30 after meeting the legal diversion requirements by direct flow appropriations in Wyoming and Nebraska west of range 55 west.</p>
                  <p>(D) Storage in reservoirs with priority dates after August 1, 1957 and storing water from the main stem of the Niobrara River east of range 62 west and the main stem of Van Tassel Creek south of section 27, township 32 north, shall be made only during the period October 1 of one (1) year to May 1 of the next year and at such times during the period May 1 and September 30 that the water is not required for direct diversion by ditches in Wyoming and in Nebraska west of range 55 west.</p>
                  <p>(E) Direct flow rights with priority dates after August 1, 1957, on the main stem of the Niobrara River east of range 62 west and Van Tassel Creek south of section 27, township 32 north, shall be regulated on a priority basis with Nebraska rights west of range 55 west, provided that any direct flow rights for maximum of one hundred forty-three (143) acres which may be granted by the Wyoming state engineer with a priority date not later than July 1, 1961 for lands which had territorial rights under the Van Tassel No. 4 Ditch with a priority date of April 8, 1882, and the Van Tassel No. 5 Ditch with a priority date of April 18, 1882, shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection (E).</p>
                  <p>(F) All direct flow diversions from the main stem of the Niobrara River east of range 62 west and from Van Tassel Creek south of section 27, township 32 north shall at all times be limited to their diversion rates as specified by Wyoming law, and provided that Wyoming laws relating to diversion of "surplus water" (W.S. 41-4-317 through 41-4-324) shall apply only when the water flowing in the main channel of the Niobrara River west of range 55 west is in excess of the legal diversion requirements of Nebraska ditches having priority dates before August 1, 1957.</p>
                  <p>Article VI</p>
                  <p>(a) Nebraska and Wyoming recognize that the future use of ground water for irrigation in the Niobrara River basin may be a factor in the depletion of the surface flows of the Niobrara River, and since the data now available are inadequate to make a determination in regard to this matter, any apportionment of the ground water of the Niobrara River basin should be delayed until such time as adequate date [data] on ground water of the basin are available.</p>
                  <p>(b) To obtain data on ground water, Nebraska and Wyoming, with the cooperation and advice of the United States geological survey, ground water branch, shall undertake ground water investigations in the Niobrara River basin in the area of the Wyoming-Nebraska state line. The investigations shall be such as are agreed to by the state engineer of Wyoming and the director of water resources of Nebraska, and may include such observation wells as the said two (2) officials agree are essential for the investigations. Costs of the investigations may be financed under the cooperative ground water programs between the United States geological survey and the states, and the states' share of the costs shall be borne equally by the two (2) states.</p>
                  <p>(c) The ground water investigations shall begin within one (1) year after the effective date of this compact. Upon collection of not more than twelve (12) months of ground water data Nebraska and Wyoming with the cooperation of the United States geological survey shall make, or cause to be made an analysis of such data to determine the desirability or necessity of apportioning the ground water by supplement to this compact. If, upon completion of the initial analysis, it is determined that apportionment of the ground water is not then desirable or necessary, re-analysis shall be made at not to exceed two (2) year intervals, using all data collected until such apportionment is made.</p>
                  <p>(d) When the results of the ground water investigations indicate that apportionment of ground water of the Niobrara River basin is desirable, the two (2) states shall proceed to negotiate a supplement to this compact apportioning the ground water of the basin.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any proposed supplement to this compact apportioning the ground water shall not become effective until ratified by the legislatures of the two (2) states and approved by the congress of the United States.</p>
                  <p>Article VII</p>
                  <p>The provisions of this compact shall remain in full force and effect until amended by action of the legislatures of the signatory states and until such amendment is consented to and approved by the congress of the United States in the same manner as this compact is required to be ratified and consented to in order to become effective.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or prevent either state from instituting or maintaining any action or proceeding, legal or equitable, in any court of competent jurisdiction for the protection of any right under this compact or the enforcement of any of its provisions.</p>
                  <p>Article IX</p>
                  <p>(a) Nothing in this compact shall be deemed:</p>
                  <p>(i) To impair or affect any rights or powers of the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities, in and to the use of the waters of the upper Niobrara River basin nor its capacity to acquire rights in and to the use of said waters; provided that any beneficial uses of the waters allocated by this compact hereafter made within a state by the United States, or those acting by or under its authority, shall be taken into account in determining the extent of use within that state.</p>
                  <p>(ii) To subject any property of the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities to taxation by either state or subdivision thereof, nor to create an obligation on the part of the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities, by reason of the acquisition, construction or operation of any property or works of whatsoever kind, to make any payment to any state or political subdivision thereof, state agency, municipality, or equity whatsoever in reimbursement for the loss of taxes.</p>
                  <p>(iii) To subject any property of the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities, to the laws of any state to an extent other than the extent to which these laws apply without regard to the compact.</p>
                  <p>(iv) To affect the obligations of the United States of America to Indians or Indian tribes, or any right owned or held by or for Indians or Indian tribes which is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
                  <p>Article X</p>
                  <p>Should a court of competent jurisdiction hold any part of this compact contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, all other severable provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
                  <p>Article XI</p>
                  <p>This compact shall become effective when ratified by the legislatures.</p>
                  <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the commissioners have signed this compact in triplicate original, one (1) of which shall be filed in the archives of the United States of America and shall be deemed the authoritative original, and one (1) copy of which shall be forwarded to the governor of each of the signatory states.</p>

Application for certificate; issuance of certificate and assignment of number; conformity with federal numbering system; expiration and renewal of certificate; transfer of ownership; duplicate certificate; manufacturer and dealer certificates.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The owner of each motorboat requiring numbering by this state shall apply for a number with the department or any place selling game and fish licenses on forms approved by the department. The application shall be signed by the owner and accompanied by the fee required by W.S. 41-13-109. At the time of application, the applicant shall also present proof in a form approved by the department of revenue that all sales or use tax due on the motorboat have been paid. Any person who knowingly presents a false or fraudulent statement of proof is subject to the provisions of W.S. 6-5-303, in addition to any penalties and interest due for nonpayment of sales or use tax on the motorboat. Upon receipt of the application in approved form the department shall issue to the applicant a certificate of number stating the number awarded to the motorboat and the name and address of the owner. The owner shall paint on or attach to each side of the bow of the motorboat the identification number in such manner as may be prescribed by rules and regulations of the commission in order that it may be completely visible. The number shall be maintained in legible condition. The certificate of number shall be pocket size and shall be available at all times for inspection on the motorboat for which issued, wherever the motorboat is operated. If any motorboat is rented for less than one (1) day, the owner or his designee may retain the certificate of number on shore if the certificate is readily available for inspection.</p>
                  <p>(b) The owner of any motorboat for which a current certificate of number has been issued pursuant to any federal law or a federally approved numbering system of another state shall, if the motorboat remains in this state in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days and is operated on the waters of this state at any time during this ninety (90) day period, apply for a certificate of number in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event that an agency of the United States government shall have in force an overall system of identification numbering for motorboats within the United States, the numbering system employed pursuant to this act by the department shall be in conformity therewith.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department may award any certificate of number directly or through authorized agents. Numbers and certificates awarded by authorized agents in conformity with this act and with rules and regulations of the commission are valid as if awarded directly by the department.</p>
                  <p>(e) All records of the department made or kept pursuant to this section shall be public records.</p>
                  <p>(f) Each certificate of number issued under this act expires on December 31 of the last year of valid registration under the certificate unless sooner terminated or discontinued under this act. A duplicate number may be obtained by an owner upon application to the department, which may require payment of a fee of not more than ten dollars ($10.00). Certificates of number may be renewed by the owner in the same manner provided under this act for obtaining initial certification.</p>
                  <p>(g) The owner of any motorboat shall within fifteen (15) days notify the department if such motorboat is destroyed or abandoned, or if his address no longer conforms to the address appearing on the certificate of number. In all such cases, the notice shall be accompanied by a surrender of the certificate of number. When the surrender of the certificate is by reason of the motorboat being destroyed or abandoned, the department shall cancel the certificate and enter such fact in its records. If the surrender is by reason of a change of address on the part of the owner, the new address shall be endorsed on the certificate and the latter returned to the owner.</p>
                  <p>(h) The purchaser of a motorboat may operate the motorboat for thirty (30) calendar days from the date of purchase without a new certificate of number if upon demand by a person authorized to enforce this act, the new owner can furnish proof of ownership and the date the motorboat was acquired. Upon transfer of ownership of a motorboat, the current certificate of number may be transferred to the new owner upon application to the department. Application by the new owner shall include his name, address and the certificate of number of the motorboat, together with payment of the registration fee prescribed by W.S. 41-13-109 and presentation of proof of transfer. Upon receipt of application and fee, the department shall transfer the certificate of number issued for the motorboat to the new owner.

                  <p>(d) In addition to subsection (c) of this section, the watercraft operator shall within ten (10) days after the date of the accident, file with the department a full description of the collision, accident or other casualty. The report required under this subsection shall be submitted on a boating accident report form approved by the department and obtained from the investigating law enforcement agency or peace officer. The department shall provide forms required under subsection (c) of this section and this subsection to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and peace officers. The report shall not be referred to in any way and shall not be used as evidence in any judicial proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the cause of any reportable watercraft accident as defined under subsection (b) of this section cannot be immediately determined during the investigation of the accident by the appropriate peace officer or law enforcement agency and the watercraft is necessary for investigative purposes, the officer or agency may temporarily seize and hold any watercraft involved in the accident.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Alcohol concentration" means as defined in W.S. 31-5-233(a)(i);</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Controlled substance" includes:</p>
                  <p>(A) Any drug or substance defined by W.S. 35-7-1002(a)(iv);</p>
                  <p>(B) Any glue, aerosol or other toxic vapor which when intentionally inhaled or sniffed results in impairment of an individual's ability to safely operate a watercraft.</p>
                  <p>(b) No owner of any watercraft or person having charge or control of a watercraft shall authorize or knowingly permit it to be operated by any person who is under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or combination thereof in violation of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) No person shall operate or be in actual physical control of a watercraft if the person:</p>
                  <p>(i) To a degree which renders him incapable of safely operating a watercraft:</p>
                  <p>(A) Is under the influence of alcohol;</p>
                  <p>(B) Is under the influence of a controlled substance; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Is under the influence of a combination of the elements named in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has an alcohol concentration of eight one- hundredths of one percent (0.08%) or more if the watercraft is a motorboat.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 87, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(d) In any criminal prosecution for a violation of this section relating to operating or being in actual physical control of a watercraft while under the influence of alcohol, the amount of alcohol in the defendant's blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of the defendant's blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:</p>
                  <p>(i) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of five one-hundredths of one percent (0.05%) or less, it shall be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence of alcohol;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of more than five one-hundredths of one percent (0.05%) and less than eight one-hundredths of one percent (0.08%) if the watercraft is a motorboat, that fact shall not give rise to any presumption that the defendant was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but it may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in subsection (d) of this section shall be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not the defendant was under the influence of alcohol. The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (c) of this section is or has been entitled to use the controlled substance under the laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against any charge under this section. It is an affirmative defense to a violation of paragraph (c)(iii) of this section that the defendant consumed a sufficient quantity of alcohol after the time of actual operation or physical control of a watercraft and before the administration of the evidentiary test to cause the defendant's alcohol concentration to exceed eight one-hundredths of one percent (0.08%) if the watercraft is a motorboat, but evidence of the consumption may not be admitted unless notice is given to the prosecution pursuant to Rule 12.1 of the Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed by Laws 1989, ch. 119, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a violation of the Wyoming controlled substances act.</p>
