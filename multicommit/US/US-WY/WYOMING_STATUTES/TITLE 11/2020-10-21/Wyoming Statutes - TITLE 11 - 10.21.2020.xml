                  <p>(a) Whenever the district board has probable cause to believe that a landowner's property is infested by weeds or pests which are liable to spread and contribute to the injury or detriment of others and the board has provided written notice of probable cause to the landowner, it shall make or have made an inspection of the suspected premises through the use of lawful entry procedures. No entry upon any premises, lands or places shall be permitted under this subsection until the landowner or occupant has been notified by certified mail and, if the landowner has consented to receive notices electronically, by electronic means that provide actual notice to the landowner or occupant that the inspection is pending at least fifteen (15) days prior to the inspection. If possible, inspections shall be scheduled and conducted with the concurrence of the landowner or occupant. If, after receiving notice that an inspection is pending, the landowner or occupant denies access to the district supervisor or the supervisor's designee, the supervisor may seek an administrative inspection warrant issued by a municipal, circuit or district court having jurisdiction over the land. No landowner shall deny access to land when presented with an administrative inspection warrant issued by a court. The court shall issue an administrative inspection warrant upon presentation by the district board, through its agent or employee, of an affidavit stating:</p>
                  <p>(i) The information that gives the district board probable cause to believe that any provision of this chapter is being or has been violated;</p>
                  <p>(ii) That the landowner or occupant has denied access to the district supervisor or the supervisor's designee or has not responded within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) A particularized description of the location of the affected land.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the suspected area is found to be infested, the district board, by resolution adopted by two-thirds (2/3) of its members, shall confirm such fact. The resolution may set forth minimum remedial requirements for control of the infested area, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The remedial requirements are likely to be effective in controlling an infestation of the species in question at the infested area;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The board includes potential estimated costs if available;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The benefits, both economic and environmental, exceed the estimated costs of the remedial requirements;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The board may assist the landowner in developing an integrated pest management plan for the species in question; and</p>
                  <p>(v) The landowner may propose alternate remedial requirements.</p>
                  <p>(c) The district board shall deliver, by certified mail, to the address of the landowner appearing on the most recent tax rolls of the district and, if the landowner has consented to receive notices electronically, by electronic means that provide actual notice to the landowner all of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) A copy of the resolution;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A statement of the estimated cost to the landowner of fulfilling the requirements and the amount that may be shared with the landowner, as determined by district board policy.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 135, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(d) At the request of the landowner, the district board shall hold a hearing in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The landowner may appeal the board's resolution to the district court.</p>
                  <p>(e) A landowner who is responsible for an infestation and fails or refuses to perform the remedial requirements for the control of the weed or pest on the infested area within the time designated in the district board's resolution may be fined not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day of violation and not more than a total of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per year as determined by the court. Any person accused under this act is entitled to a trial by jury. The accumulated fines under this section are a lien against the property of the landowner from the day notice is delivered to the landowner by the district board. All fines shall be deposited with the county treasurer and credited to the county school fund.</p>

                  <p>(a) The affairs of each district shall be administered by a board of directors, each of whom shall be a bona fide resident of Wyoming. Directors for the positions identified in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection shall be elected at an annual meeting of district livestock owners. Directors for the positions identified in paragraphs (iv) and (v) of this subsection shall be appointed as described. The composition of the board shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Three (3) directors shall be sheep owners having paid predator management fees on sheep in the district in the year preceding election. At each subsequent annual district meeting one (1) director shall be elected for a three (3) year term. Subject to the provisions of W.S. 11-6-203(a), all sheep owners whether an individual, corporation or partnership, having paid predator management fees on sheep in the district regardless of the domicile of the sheep, are entitled to one (1) vote at the meeting;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Three (3) directors shall be cattle owners having paid predator management fees on cattle in the district in the year preceding election. At each subsequent annual district meeting one (1) director shall be elected for a three (3) year term.

                  <p>(iii) If a qualified applicant for a director position identified in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subsection cannot be found or if no qualified applicant seeks election to the board of directors, then the director position may be filled by an otherwise qualified elector, provided no more than four (4) directors may represent any one (1) species of livestock;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The board of county commissioners shall appoint one (1) director to serve for an initial term of two (2) years and thereafter for three (3) year terms from electors in the county not engaged in raising sheep or cattle. No appointed member may serve for a consecutive period of more than six (6) years;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the board of directors determines state funds are necessary for an effective predator management program to assure the statutory requirements provided in W.S. 11-6-205 are fulfilled and state funds are appropriated and received for that purpose, then three (3) directors representing sportsmen and hunters from the district shall be appointed to the board of directors by the county commissioners serving the local district. Sportsmen and hunter representatives shall be bona fide residents of the district not engaged in raising sheep or cattle and shall hold or have held either a valid Wyoming fishing or hunting license or a Wyoming wildlife damage management stamp within the preceding twelve (12) month period. County commissioners, to the greatest extent practical, shall select sportsmen and hunter representatives to ensure representation from as broad a geographic distribution of the district as possible. The county commissioners shall determine who of the three (3) sportsmen and hunter directors appointed to a board under this paragraph shall serve an initial term of one (1) year, who shall serve an initial term of (2) years and who shall serve a term of three (3) years. Thereafter, each term shall be for three (3) years.</p>

Thereafter, each term shall be for three (3) years.</p>
                  <p>(b) No director shall continue to hold office after disqualification under any of the provisions of this section. All vacancies on the district board may be filled for unexpired terms by the other directors in office except the public member's and the sportsmen and hunter member's unexpired term shall be filled by board of county commissioners appointment. All members shall hold their offices until their successors are elected and qualified.</p>
                  <p>(c) For directors appointed by a board of county commissioners, the county commissioners may remove the director for cause without a public hearing unless the director requests that the action be taken during a public hearing.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>11-6-210. Creation of predator management district fund; predator management fees; donations; appropriation by county commissioners.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) At the time of collecting brand inspection fees imposed under W.S. 11-20-401 and 11-20-402, the brand inspector shall collect predator management fees on all sheep and cattle inspected within each predator management district. However, predator management fees shall not be collected on cattle and sheep shipped into this state for immediate sale or slaughter. The amount of the fee for each predator management district shall be established by each predator management district board in consultation with the state predator management advisory board and shall not exceed one dollar ($1.00) per head on sheep and cattle. The directors elected pursuant to W.S. 11-6-202(a)(i) and (ii) from each predator management district board shall annually determine the predator management fee to be charged and collected in the district taking into consideration comments solicited from the producers present at the district's annual meeting as provided for in W.S. 11-6-203, who have paid predator management fees within the district during the preceding twelve (12) months and shall inform the livestock board of the fee prior to January 1 each year. The fee shall not be collected on the same livestock more than once in any twelve (12) month period. The livestock board may retain not to exceed five percent (5%) of the revenues collected for the actual cost of collecting the predator management fee. Remaining revenues collected by the livestock board under this section shall be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in an account. The state treasurer, on a quarterly basis, shall distribute the revenues to the county treasurer of the county from which the shipment originated unless, at the time of payment of the fees, the livestock owner designates the fees to be distributed in total to another county in this state in which the livestock are fed or pastured. The county treasurer shall deposit revenues distributed under this subsection into a special continuing fund, to be known as the "Predator Management District Fund of .... County" and to be administered by the predator management board of that district.</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed by Laws 1990, ch. 87, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(c) Repealed by Laws 1990, ch. 87, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(d) The district board may receive donations and appropriations of money from any source, and such donations and appropriations shall be placed in the district fund by the county treasurer upon request of the district board. Nothing in W.S. 11-6-201 through 11-6-210 shall be construed to prohibit boards of county commissioners from appropriating funds for the purpose of controlling predatory animals and predacious birds, and such appropriation by boards of county commissioners is authorized.</p>
                  <p>(e) Repealed by Laws 1990, ch. 87, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the amount of the annual predator management fee for sheep and cattle shipped into this state for confinement in a commercial feedlot shall not exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25) per head on sheep and cattle. For purposes of this subsection, "commercial feedlot" means any place, establishment or facility commonly known as a feedlot conducted, operated or managed for profit or nonprofit for livestock producers, feeders or market agencies, consisting of pens and their appurtenances, in which livestock are received, held, fed, cared for or kept for sale or shipment in commerce. A pasture, field or other enclosure, fenced or unfenced, shall not be considered a commercial feedlot for purposes of this subsection. The predator management district board shall have the authority to determine if a facility qualifies as a commercial feedlot as defined in this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(g) Each predator management district board shall annually allocate five percent (5%) of all predator management fee collections to be used for refunds, in whole or in part. If a refund is requested the board shall pay the refund within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the calendar year in which the fee was paid. Refunds under this subsection shall be subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) To be valid, the application for refund shall be received no later than sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar year in which the fee was paid;</p>
                  <p>(ii) No person receiving a refund shall receive any predatory animal control services funded in whole or in part by the predatory animal control fees until that person has paid one hundred fifty percent (150%) of all refunds received during the year in which the services were sought and the three (3) preceding calendar years; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) All monies not paid in refunds shall annually revert to the district predator management account on July 1 of the following year.</p>
                  <p>(h) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, no predatory animal control fee shall be collected on livestock shipped or trailed within this state if change of ownership does not occur.</p>
                  <p>(j) Any person failing to pay the predator animal control fee imposed by subsection (a) or (f) of this section shall be punished as provided by W.S. 11-1-103.</p>
                  <p>(k) In addition to the other fees imposed by this section, any person paying the predator control fee may pay an additional ten cents ($.10) per head to fund the predator management activities of the Wyoming animal damage management board created by W.S. 11-6-303. Any fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the animal damage management account created by W.S. 11-6-306.</p>
                  <p>(m) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 46, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(n) If a livestock producer requests predator management services from the district board representing the county in which the producer is pasturing or housing livestock, and no predator management fees have been collected from the producer within the previous twelve (12) months, or if the fees have been refunded, the board may charge a service fee to recover reasonable and actual costs of the predator management services provided.</p>
                  <p>(o) To be eligible to receive state funds, the district shall assess and collect all available fees on livestock in the district.</p>

                  <p>(v) The department may refuse to register a pollination apiary based upon its own investigation of the matter, but if the department approves the application, it shall specify the number of hives and location of pollination apiaries needed for the purpose of pollinating the applicant's commercial agricultural crop adequately; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) A copy of the pollination contract between the seedgrower and beekeeper shall be sent to the department.</p>

                  <p>(iv) If the department determines that too many hobbyist apiaries are being registered within too close proximity of each other or of other established apiaries so that there is danger of the spread of bee diseases, bee parasites or bee pests among bees or apiaries or that there will be interference with the proper feeding and honey flow of established apiaries, the department may refuse to grant any further hobbyist registrations in the locality and area of the danger.</p>
                  <p>(b) No certificate of registration of a hobbyist apiary may be leased, assigned or transferred, and no person other than the hobbyist apiary registrant may exercise in any way any rights or privileges authorized by the certificate of registration.</p>

                  <p>(a) No owner of an established registered apiary shall change the location of the apiary without first receiving from the department authorization to establish the new apiary. In making the application, the owner shall specify the location of the apiary with the same particularity as in the application for original registration. If the new apiary is not used according to W.S. 11-7-211, the certificate of registration lapses and all rights under the registration terminate. Registrations for new apiaries shall not be issued for greater areas than the applicant can show are reasonably necessary for his needs consistent with good beekeeping practice.</p>
                  <p>(b) A registered apiary may be sold or transferred to a purchaser subject to applicable provisions of this chapter if all bees and equipment on the apiary are sold to the purchaser.</p>
                  <p>(c) No person may increase the number of hives on an apiary to exceed the number of hives consistent with good beekeeping practices authorized by his certificate of registration for that apiary, except that a person may increase the number of hives on a general apiary beyond the number authorized by the certificate of registration in order to protect his bees and hives from bears or other predators. A person may also enlarge a general apiary during the spring buildup and in the fall after the end of the honey season in order to gather his bees for shipment out of the state or to winter his bees on that apiary.</p>

                  <p>(a) The registration of an apiary which is not stocked with bees during at least forty-five (45) continuous days of the normal buildup or honey producing season is forfeited and all rights under the certificate of registration terminate.</p>
                  <p>(b) An apiary not regularly attended in accordance with good beekeeping practice, which comprises a hazard or threat to disease control in the beekeeping industry or which by reason of its physical condition or construction cannot be inspected, may be considered an abandoned apiary and may be seized by the department. Any diseased equipment or equipment which by reason of its physical condition or construction cannot be inspected may be burned, and any remaining equipment may be sold at public auction. Proceeds, after the cost of the sale is deducted, shall be returned to the former owner or his estate. Before burning or selling any equipment, the department shall give the owner or person in charge a written notice at least five (5) days before the burning or sale. The notice shall be given by certified mail or personal service upon the owner or person in charge of the property.

                  <p>(ii) Order disinfection of any bee, beehive, brood comb or any other equipment which is infected or contaminated and burn any infected or contaminated bee, beehive, brood comb or any other equipment if, in its judgment, disinfection will not remove the infection or contamination. Before burning any property, the department shall give the owner or person in charge a written notice at least ten (10) days before the date on which the property will be burned. The notice shall be given by certified mail or personal service upon the owner or person in charge of the property;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Quarantine any apiary where foulbrood or any contagious or infectious bee diseases, bee parasites or bee pests are present and, during the quarantine, prevent the removal from the apiary of any bees or equipment except under a special permit issued by the department permitting the removal under conditions it prescribes. A person may not sell or offer for sale any apiary, bees or equipment which are under quarantine unless the department issues a permit authorizing the sale or removal. Written notice of quarantine shall be posted by the department, owner or person in charge at the quarantined apiary at a conspicuous place, and a copy shall be personally served or sent by certified mail to the owner of the apiary or person in charge. The quarantine continues in effect until it is ordered removed and a copy of the removal order served in the same manner;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Inspect any apiary, hives, equipment or premises for the presence of bee diseases, bee parasites or bee pests. Hives belonging to persons owning apiaries within the state shall be inspected for contagious diseases according to schedules established by the department. Apiary inspectors shall establish the date for the inspection of any apiary with the beekeeper. The inspection date shall be agreeable to the inspector and the beekeeper and shall include a total of seven (7) consecutive days upon which the inspection can be undertaken due to weather and unforeseen circumstances. Any beekeeper responsible for an apiary who refuses an inspection on any of the seven (7) agreed upon dates is subject to penalties provided pursuant to W.S. 11-7-133;</p>
                  <p>(v) Order the hives within an apiary which is not legally registered with the state to be confiscated. The owner of the apiary shall be notified at least seven (7) days prior to the date of confiscation. Notification shall be by certified mail addressed to the last known address of the owner or by personal service upon the owner;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Promulgate and enforce rules adopted to carry out the purpose of this chapter;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Enter into agreements with the game and fish commission as necessary to protect bees and hives against wild animals;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Assist any sheriff, peace officer or district attorney in any county in the discharge of their duties or investigations relating to the apiary industry.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any owner of bees possessing more than fifty (50) colonies shall furnish one (1) helper to assist the inspector. Apiary inspectors may inspect bee colonies at any time without previous notice.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any person failing to comply with a rule, order or provision of a quarantine pursuant to this section is subject to penalties provided in W.S. 11-7-133.</p>

The court shall grant the stay only if the warehouseman, officer, director, employee or agent shows he will be irreparably harmed unless the stay issues and there is substantial likelihood he will prevail on the merits.</p>

                <p>(a) The director or his agent shall have access during normal business hours to establishments or facilities in which commercial feed is manufactured, transported or held for distribution, and to information relating to manufacture, transportation or distribution of the feed for purposes of sampling and inspection.</p>
                <p>(b) The methods of sampling and analysis shall be those adopted by the director from the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. In cases not covered by such methods, or in cases where methods are available in which improved applicability has been demonstrated, the director may adopt such appropriate methods from other sources. The director, in determining whether a commercial feed is deficient in any component, shall be guided solely by the official sample analyzed in accordance with the methods so adopted. A deficiency in an official sample of commercial feed resulting from nonuniformity during packaging is deemed to be a deficiency for the purposes of this act. For purposes of this act, the results of official analysis shall be final, unless it is determined by the director that a resample is warranted. If a distributor or registrant requests a resample of a commercial feed based upon the director's findings of a deficiency, all costs associated with the resampling and analysis shall be borne by the distributor or registrant.

                <p>(A) Its labeling is false or misleading in any particular;</p>
                <p>(B) It is distributed under the name of another commercial feed;</p>

                <p>(c) The department in determining whether any commercial fertilizer is deficient in plant food shall be guided solely by the official sample obtained and analyzed as provided for in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) Official samples establishing a penalty for nutrient deficiency shall be retained for a minimum of ninety (90) days from issuance of a deficiency report. A deficiency in an official sample of mixed fertilizer resulting from nonuniformity is not distinguishable from a deficiency due to actual plant nutrient shortage and is properly subject to official action.</p>
                <p>(e) For purposes of this act, the results of official analysis shall be final, unless it is determined by the director that a resample is warranted. Should a distributor or registrant request a resample of a fertilizer based upon the director's findings of a deficiency, all costs associated with the resampling and analysis shall be borne by the distributor or registrant. If results of the resampling establish the results of first analysis were invalid, the department shall bear the costs associated with the resampling.</p>

                <p>2009 Wyoming Session Laws, Chapter 92, provides this section is effective on and after July 1, 2009 only upon certification of the governor to the secretary of state that the United States department of homeland security has published final federal rules under H.R. 2764, Subtitle J, Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate or its successor. As of the date of the publication of the 2009 Wyoming statutes no such certification had been made.</p>
                <p>(a) Any person who possesses ammonium nitrate or regulated ammonium nitrate materials shall be registered with the department. The registration application shall be on a form approved by the director in consultation with and upon the recommendation of the director of the office of homeland security. The director shall charge an annual registration fee not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00). Nothing in this section shall require the registration of any person who produces, sells or purchases ammonium nitrate exclusively for use in the production of an explosive under a license or permit issued under chapter 40 of title 18, U.S.C.</p>
                <p>(b) Ammonium nitrate and regulated ammonium nitrate materials shall be secured to provide reasonable protection against vandalism, theft or other unauthorized use. Reasonable protection may include, but not be limited to, ensuring that storage facilities are fenced and locked when unattended, and inspected daily for signs of attempted entry or vandalism to any storage facility. The director in consultation with or upon the recommendation of the director of the office of homeland security, may recommend other security measures. The director shall work in consultation with or upon the recommendation of the director of the office of homeland security to provide information to ammonium nitrate users on appropriate security measures.</p>
                <p>(c) A distributor shall record the date of sale and quantity sold, the valid state or federal driver's license number, the current physical address and telephone number for the purchaser of ammonium nitrate or regulated ammonium nitrate materials. If the purchaser obtains physical possession of ammonium nitrate or regulated ammonium nitrate material, the distributor shall obtain the registrant’s registration number as a condition of completing the sale. A registrant, if not a distributor, shall record the date of application. All sale and application records shall be retained by each registrant for a period of not less than two (2) years.</p>
                <p>(d) Registrants shall comply with all federal and state requirements regarding the dissemination of any information, providing the director and the director of the office of homeland security access to the records.</p>
                <p>(e) For the purposes of this section:</p>
                <p>(i) "Ammonium nitrate" means chiefly the ammonium salt of nitric acid. Ammonium nitrate shall not contain less than thirty-three percent (33%) nitrogen, one-half (1/2) of which is the ammonium form and one-half (1/2) of which is the nitrate form;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Regulated ammonium nitrate materials" means regulated ammonium nitrate material fertilizer products which have been determined by the director in consultation with and upon the recommendation of the director of the office of homeland security to warrant regulation based on the potential explosive capacity of the fertilizer material determined by the ammonium nitrate content.</p>

                <p>After the hearing, if the commission determines, upon the facts presented at the hearing and other relevant facts that are available, that there is need in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare for a conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall record such determination and define by metes and bounds or by legal subdivisions the boundaries of the district. In making the determination and defining the boundaries, the commission shall give weight and consideration to the topography of the area considered and of the state, the composition of soils therein, the distribution of erosion, the carrying capacity and condition of grazing lands, the numbers of livestock grazed, the prevailing land use and management practices, the desirability and necessity of including within the district the particular lands under consideration and the benefits such land may receive from being included within the district, the relation of the proposed district to existing watersheds and agricultural regions and to other conservation districts already organized or proposed for organization, and such other physical, geographical and economic factors as are relevant, having due regard to the legislative policy set forth in W.S. 11-16-103. The territory included within the district need not be contiguous. If the commission determines there is no need for a conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall record such determination and deny the petition. Any owner of lands within a proposed district which is less than a countywide district may have his owned and leased lands excluded from the proposed district upon presentation of a petition and description of the lands to the commission not less than seven (7) days prior to the holding of the referendum for the organization of the district.</p>

                <p>(a) If the commission determines the operation of the proposed district is administratively practicable, it shall appoint two (2) supervisors who are owners of land in the district to act with three (3) supervisors elected as provided hereinafter as the governing body of the district. The district shall be a governmental subdivision of this state and a public body corporate and politic. The two (2) appointed supervisors shall present to the secretary of state an application signed by them setting forth by recital only and not in detail:</p>
                <p>(i) That a petition for the creation of the district was filed with the commission pursuant to the provisions of this act, and the proceedings specified in the act were taken pursuant to the petition;</p>
                <p>(ii) That the application is filed to complete the organization of the district as a governmental subdivision and a public body, corporate and politic, under this act;</p>
                <p>(iii) That the commission has appointed them as supervisors;</p>
                <p>(iv) The name and official residence of each supervisor and a certified copy of the appointment evidencing his right to office;</p>
                <p>(v) The term of office of each supervisor;</p>
                <p>(vi) The name of the district; and</p>
                <p>(vii) The location of the principal office of the supervisors of the district.</p>
                <p>(b) The application shall be subscribed and sworn to by each supervisor before an officer authorized to administer oaths, who shall certify upon the application that he personally knows the supervisors and knows them to be the officers affirmed in the application, and that each has subscribed thereto in the officer's presence. The application shall be accompanied by a certified statement by the commission, setting forth the boundaries of the district but otherwise containing no detail other than the mere recitals that:</p>
                <p>(i) A petition was filed, notice issued and hearing held as required by law;</p>
                <p>(ii) The commission determined that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, for a conservation district to function in the proposed territory and did define the boundaries;</p>
                <p>(iii) Notice was given and a referendum held on the question of the creation of such district;</p>
                <p>(iv) The result of the referendum showed a majority of the votes cast in favor of the creation of the district; and</p>
                <p>(v) The commission did determine the operation of the proposed district is administratively practicable.</p>
                <p>(c) The secretary of state shall examine the application and statement and if he finds the name proposed for the district is not so similar to that of another conservation district as to cause confusion or uncertainty, he shall record them in an appropriate book in his office. If the secretary of state finds the name proposed for the district is so similar to that of any other conservation district of this state as to lead to confusion, he shall certify that fact to the commission, which shall submit a new name for the district which is not subject to such defects. Upon receipt of the new name the secretary of state shall record the application and statement, with the name so modified, in an appropriate book. When the application and statement have been made, filed and recorded, the district is a governmental subdivision of this state and a public body corporate and politic. The secretary of state shall issue to the supervisors a certificate, under the seal of the state, of the organization of the district, and shall record the certificate with the application and statement. The boundaries of the district shall include the territory determined by the commission, but shall not include any area included within the boundaries of another conservation district organized under this act.</p>

                <p>(a) After five (5) years after the organization of a district under this act, any ten (10) owners of land lying within the district may petition the commission that the operations of the district be discontinued and the existence of the district terminated. The commission may conduct public meetings and hearings upon the petition as necessary in the consideration thereof. Within sixty (60) days after a petition has been filed with the commission, it shall give notice of a referendum as provided in the Special District Elections Act of 1994. The commission shall supervise the referendum and issue appropriate regulations governing the conduct thereof. The question shall be submitted by ballots upon which the words "For terminating the existence of the .... (name of the conservation district to be here inserted)" and "Against terminating the existence of the .... (name of the conservation district to be here inserted)" shall appear, with a square before each proposition and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before one (1) or the other as the voter may favor or oppose dissolution of the district. Qualified electors of the district are eligible to vote in the referendum. No informalities in the conduct of the referendum or related matters shall invalidate the referendum or result if notice is given substantially as herein provided and the referendum is fairly conducted.</p>
                <p>(b) The commission shall publish the result of the referendum. If a majority of the votes cast in the referendum oppose dissolution of the district, the commission shall determine whether the continued operation of the district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable. If the commission determines the continued operation of the district is administratively practicable, it shall record its determination and deny the petition. If a majority of the votes cast favor dissolution of the district it shall certify that fact to the supervisors of the district. In making the determination of administrative practicality to continue the district the commission shall consider those factors set forth in W.S. 11-16-112 for creation of the district.</p>
                <p>(c) Upon receipt from the commission of a certification that the majority of votes cast in the referendum favor dissolution of the district, the supervisors shall forthwith terminate the affairs of the district. The supervisors shall dispose of all property belonging to the district at public auction and pay the net proceeds of the sales to the state treasurer. The supervisors shall thereupon file a verified application with the secretary of state for dissolution of the district, and shall transmit with the application the certificate of the commission that the majority of votes cast at the referendum favored dissolution of the district. The application shall recite that the property of the district has been disposed of and the proceeds paid over as provided by law, setting forth a full accounting of the properties and proceeds of sale. The secretary of state shall issue to the supervisors a certificate of dissolution and shall record the certificate in an appropriate book in his office. The secretary of state shall make no charge for any service required of him by this act.</p>
                <p>(d) Upon issuance of a certificate of dissolution all ordinances and regulations adopted and in force within the district are void. All contracts to which the district or supervisors are parties remain in force and effect for the period provided in such contracts. The commission shall be substituted for the district or supervisors as party to the contracts. The commission is entitled to all benefits and subject to all liabilities under such contracts and has the same right and liability to perform, require performance, sue and be sued thereon, and to modify or terminate the contracts as the supervisors of the district would have had. Dissolution does not affect the lien of any judgment entered or the pendency of any action instituted under W.S. 11-16-126 [repealed], and the commission succeeds to all rights and obligations of the district or supervisors as to such liens and actions.</p>

Vacancies in the office of any supervisor shall be filled by appointment by the commission upon the recommendations of the district supervisors, the appointee to serve until the next election at which time the vacancy shall be filled by the electors for the unexpired term. A supervisor shall receive no compensation for his services, but is entitled to expenses, including traveling expenses, necessarily incurred in the discharge of his duties. Any supervisor may be removed by the commission upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.</p>
                <p>(b) A majority of the supervisors constitutes a quorum and the concurrence of three (3) supervisors is required for determination of any matter.</p>
                <p>(c) The supervisors shall require a bond to be issued for all employees and officers entrusted with funds or property. The supervisors shall provide for keeping a full and accurate record of all proceedings, resolutions, regulations and orders issued or adopted. The accounts, receipts and disbursements of the district shall be subject to the audit and reporting requirements set forth in W.S. 9-1-507(a)(iii).</p>
                <p>(d) All cities, towns, villages or other urban and suburban areas lying wholly or partly within the exterior boundaries of a conservation district shall, from the effective date of this act, be included in the district. In doubtful cases, the commission shall determine the district which includes any urban or suburban area.</p>
                <p>(e) By cooperative agreement with the city concerned, a district may perform within the boundaries of the city any work required or authorized under this act, through such administrative and financial arrangements as the city and the district agree upon.</p>

                  <p>(ii) It bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health under customary or usual use;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Its container is composed of any injurious or deleterious substance which may render the animal remedy injurious to health;</p>
                  <p>(iv) It was prepared, packed or held under unsanitary conditions where the animal remedy may have become contaminated with filth or where the animal remedy may have been rendered injurious to animal health;</p>
                  <p>(v) Its composition, purity, strength or quality falls below or differs from that which it is purported or is represented to possess by its labeling. The director shall allow a reasonable tolerance from such representation as is in accordance with good manufacturing practices.</p>
                  <p>(h) No person shall forge, counterfeit, simulate or falsely represent or without proper authority use, any mark, stamp, tag, label or other identification device required by W.S. 11-17-205.</p>
                  <p>(j) No person shall alter, mutilate, destroy, obliterate or remove any part of the labeling of any animal remedy if the act results in the animal remedy being misbranded, or do any other act, while the animal remedy is being held for sale, which results in the misbranding of the animal remedy.</p>

                  <p>(iii) A copy of the analysis or other examination which bears on the case.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any lot of an animal remedy not in compliance with requirements of laws or regulations is subject to seizure on complaint of the director to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the animal remedy is located. If the court finds the animal remedy in violation and orders the condemnation of the animal remedy, it shall be disposed of in any manner consistent with the quality of the animal remedy and the laws of Wyoming. In no instance shall the disposition of the animal remedy be ordered by the court without first giving the manufacturer, distributor or registrant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of the animal remedy or for permission to process or relabel the animal remedy to bring it into compliance with the law.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person or government entity who knows or suspects that there is any contagious or infectious reportable disease among animals owned by or under their jurisdiction or any veterinarian who knows or suspects any reportable contagious or infectious disease on any premises or in any animal, shall immediately report the same to the state veterinarian. The state veterinarian shall establish and manage a list of reportable diseases for any contagious or infectious disease deemed by the state veterinarian to be a threat to domestic animals. During development of this list the state veterinarian shall consult with the Wyoming game and fish department's supervisor of veterinary research services. Information collected in response to the list of reportable diseases shall be considered confidential proprietary information. Access to any information collected under the list of reportable diseases shall be limited to the person who reported the disease and the state veterinarian, except that the state veterinarian may at his discretion notify any of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The Wyoming livestock board;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The state veterinary laboratory;</p>

                  <p>(c) A failure to report, or any attempt to conceal the existence of the disease or to willfully or maliciously obstruct or resist the veterinarian in the discharge of his duty is a misdemeanor. Any person who willfully or maliciously falsifies a report to the state veterinarian is guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person convicted of any of the above acts or omissions shall be punished as provided in W.S. 11-1-103.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any person who knows that they own or have in their possession any livestock as defined by W.S. 11-20-101(a)(iv) infected with any disease formally declared by the Wyoming livestock board, through rule and regulation, as being potentially economically devastating and for which there is a valid diagnostic test and who transfers ownership or possession of the livestock to another person, or who knowingly or through his own neglect allows the livestock to commingle with uninfected livestock, is liable for the economic damages caused by the spread of the disease to uninfected livestock. In addition to the conditions for liability and recovery set in subsection (e) of this section, damages shall be available under this subsection only to a transferee who accepts the diseased animal directly from the liable person and to the owner of an animal that becomes infected as the result of direct contact with the diseased animal.

No livestock sales or auction facility shall be subject to the liability imposed by subsection (d) of this section if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The existence of disease was not reported to the facility and the facility did not know of the existence of the disease; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The facility provided written notice of the disease to the person claiming damages under subsection (d) of this section.</p>

The sale shall be made at the time and place and in the manner prescribed by the veterinarian. Not less than three (3) days nor more than fifteen (15) days notice of the time, place and purpose of the sale shall be given by the veterinarian to the owner or persons in charge of the animals, by personal service within the county in which the animals are being held if possible, and if not possible then such notice may be given either by personal service outside of the county or by advertisement in any paper selected by the veterinarian. The state veterinarian shall only sell the animals after all other remedies have been exhausted.</p>
                  <p>(f) The owner of animals so seized and held may at any time prior to sale recover possession of the same by paying to the state veterinarian the amount of costs incurred by order of the veterinarian against the animals. Any sum realized from the sale of the animals over the cost actually incurred against the animals shall be returned to the owner of the animals if known or can by reasonable diligence be found. Otherwise the overage shall be placed in the estray fund and dispensed as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any order or other action under this chapter may be appealed by the owner, or the agent of the owner, of the animals affected or by any aggrieved governmental entity to the board as follows:</p>

                  <p>(a) All claims against the state arising from the ordered disposal of animals by the state veterinarian for scrapie, brucellosis and tuberculosis, together with the order of the veterinarian, shall be submitted to the state auditor who shall examine them without unnecessary delay. For purposes of this section, "disposal" means to sell, send to slaughter or destroy the animal. For each claim he finds to be equitable and entitled to indemnity under this chapter the auditor shall issue his warrant on the state treasurer for the sum named in the claim. All claims for indemnity arising under the provisions of this chapter, before they are presented for payment to the auditor, shall be submitted to the state veterinarian who shall fully inform himself of the facts connected with each claim. The state veterinarian shall endorse on each claim his approval or rejection and shall express in such endorsement the reasons for his approval or rejection.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the state veterinarian rejects a claim it and the reasons for rejection shall be submitted to a board of arbitration consisting of three (3) members selected as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state veterinarian shall select one (1) stock grower who is a resident of the county where the ordered disposed animal for which the claim is made ranged;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The claimant shall select one (1) stock grower who is a resident of the same county; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) These two (2) shall choose the third member from among the stock growers of the same county.</p>
                  <p>(c) The indemnity granted under this section shall be the difference between the fair market value of the livestock and the amount received for the sale, less any amount of reimbursement provided for and paid under federal law and regulation. Fair market value shall be determined by using comparable sales data from state markets at the time of removal or by the use of a qualified independent livestock appraiser as designated by the state veterinarian. If no sale is transacted, but an animal is removed for diagnostic purposes or disposal, the reimbursement provided shall be the fair market value minus any other reimbursement. Unless otherwise reimbursed, the cost of shipping or transportation and commission charges shall be added to the amount provided to the producer for livestock indemnification. It shall be paid to the owner upon his application and presentation of proofs prescribed herein within six (6) months of the date of ordered disposal for which payment is claimed. The claim shall be barred if not presented within the time limited.</p>
                  <p>(d) Payments shall be made by the state treasurer from funds appropriated to the animal reimbursement program account under W.S. 11-19-118 and as provided by W.S. 11-19-109. The right to indemnity is limited to animals destroyed by reason of existence or suspected existence of some epizootic form of infectious or contagious diseases, generally fatal or incurable.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created the animal reimbursement program account into which shall be deposited revenues as provided by law.

                  <p>(a) The interaction of livestock and wildlife may lead to mutual or shared diseases. Some of these diseases may have the potential to adversely affect Wyoming's livestock producers and influence the management of Wyoming's free-ranging wildlife. Research into these diseases may provide strategies or solutions that benefit Wyoming's livestock industries and wildlife resources.</p>
                  <p>(b) The purpose of the Wyoming wildlife/livestock disease research partnership is to utilize existing personnel and facilities of the state, to identify funding sources, to enhance wildlife and livestock disease research in the state, and to understand, manage, control and preempt potentially mutual or shared diseases that may impact wildlife, livestock or humans.</p>

                  <p>(a) The Wyoming bighorn/domestic sheep plan shall be developed and maintained by rule and regulation as provided in this section to address potential conflicts arising out of the interaction between bighorn sheep and domestic sheep within the state. The final report and recommendations from the Wyoming state-wide bighorn/domestic sheep interaction working group dated September 2004 together with appendices A through N as adopted by the group is adopted as the initial Wyoming bighorn/domestic sheep plan under this section and shall continue as revised or amended until repealed or nullified pursuant to law.</p>
                  <p>(b) Rules and regulations necessary to administer this article shall be promulgated jointly by the game and fish commission, the board of agriculture and the livestock board. The game and fish commission, the board of agriculture and the livestock board may jointly consider recommendations for changes to the plan and may revise or amend the plan through the rulemaking process pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(c) The goal of the Wyoming bighorn/domestic sheep plan shall be to maintain the health of bighorn sheep populations while sustaining an economically viable domestic sheep population.</p>
                  <p>(d) The most current version of the Wyoming bighorn/domestic sheep plan shall be published on the website of the game and fish commission.</p>
                  <p>(e) In conformance with the Wyoming bighorn/domestic sheep plan the game and fish department may relocate or remove bighorn sheep to another area of the state if a federal judicial action or agency decision would require elimination of domestic sheep grazing in any area or herd unit designated in the Wyoming bighorn/domestic sheep plan as a nonemphasis herd. The game and fish department shall be reimbursed for the costs of relocation or removal of sheep under this subsection from funds available in the wildlife/livestock disease research partnership account.</p>

                  <p>(b) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 191, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this section or except as provided in W.S. 11-20-211, 11-20-217, 11-20-224 and 11-20-230, it is unlawful for any person, firm, partnership, corporation or association to remove or cause to be removed in any way from any county in Wyoming to any other county, any livestock unless each animal has been inspected for brands and ownership at the time of delivery or removal by an authorized Wyoming brand inspector and a proper certificate of inspection or clearance has been issued, except where the board has established brand inspection zones for each species of livestock.

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided, before selling, changing ownership or removing any livestock from any county of Wyoming, the person selling, changing ownership or intending to cause removal shall notify the inspector of the date of the intended removal and the time and place when and where the required inspection for brands and ownership can be made. The inspection shall be made within a reasonable time prior to shipment. The person in charge of the livestock shall hold the livestock at the place designated until the livestock have been inspected and an official certificate of inspection is issued.

                  <p>(b) Upon being notified of the intention of any person to sell, change ownership or remove from the county any livestock when a prior inspection is required by law, the inspector notified shall go to the place designated at the time agreed upon, and make an inspection for brands and ownership of the livestock.</p>
                  <p>(c) The inspection shall only be done under conditions that allow the inspector, at the sole discretion of the inspector, to adequately view the livestock for the purpose of determining brands. The inspector shall list by classes the livestock, showing number of each class and all brands, together with the names of owners of the brands, if known. The inspector may require from the person in charge proof of ownership of the livestock to be removed from the county, by brand record, bill of sale or the affidavits of at least two (2) responsible citizens of the county who are not interested financially in the animals. If ownership of any of the livestock is not claimed by the person intending to remove them from the county, then written authorization from the owner for such removal is required.</p>
                  <p>(d) Estrays, the ownership of which is unknown, shall not be removed from the county except by order of the inspector in accordance with W.S. 11-24-102.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any inspector, upon completing an inspection of livestock for brands and ownership, shall record the inspection upon a form furnished by the Wyoming livestock board. When completed and signed by the inspector and the owner of the livestock or the owner's designee, the form is a certificate of inspection authorizing the removal from the county of the livestock listed. The inspector shall deliver a copy of the certificate to the person in charge of the livestock. If movement is to be by truck, a copy of the certificate shall be delivered by the person in charge of the animals to the driver or person in charge of the truck or trucks, and shall be kept in the latter's possession until the livestock are delivered at the final destination as shown on the certificate of inspection, and shall be exhibited upon request to any person authorized to enforce the brand inspection laws of this state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Failure or refusal by the driver of any vehicle to exhibit a certificate of inspection or a properly executed shipper's certificate and agreement or permit listing the livestock being transported within the state, is justification for any authorized person to hold the vehicle and the livestock, at the carrier's or the shipper's expense, until the carrier establishes his right to transport the livestock. If the carrier cannot establish his right to transport the livestock within twelve (12) hours, the vehicle and livestock shall be impounded as provided by W.S. 11-20-228, pending complete investigation and disposition as provided by law.</p>

                  <p>(a) When the proof of ownership inspection is used, inspectors shall require proof of ownership of livestock upon change of ownership as provided by W.S. 11-20-203(a) and an instrument evidencing such ownership shall be delivered by the shipper to the inspector who shall attach it to the form and return it to the agency.</p>
                  <p>(b) The furnishing of false proof of prior ownership is probable cause for investigation of a felony offense being committed. All livestock involved shall be remanded to the custody of the Wyoming livestock board pending the outcome of the investigation and criminal charges, if any. Costs incurred for maintenance of the livestock involved shall be paid by the person who furnished false proof of ownership. Should the investigation show the only offense involved is furnishing false proof of ownership, the person furnishing such false proof shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) or more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) or imprisoned for not more than six (6) months, or both.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board may issue an in-state range movement permit for the movement of livestock from a location in Wyoming to a noncontiguous location in another county provided the applicant and the ranch meet the requirements of this subsection and criteria established by rules of the board. The movement shall be for the purpose of pasturing, grazing, feeding the livestock, veterinary care, commercial lease or use or other board approved movement that is considered necessary for normal ranch management operating conditions. The movement shall not be for the purpose of changing ownership. A permit under this section may be issued only to bona fide owners or Wyoming resident lessees of qualified ranch lands headquartered within Wyoming or their authorized employees. As used in this section, a qualified ranch means a ranch that has been used for a period of time or purpose specified by the board and which use can be verified by brand inspection records.

                  <p>(a) Subject to conditions set forth in this section, no prior inspection for brands and ownership is required of horses, mules, cattle or sheep being or about to be transported to any open market where Wyoming brand inspection is maintained whether within or outside Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(b) In lieu of an official inspection for brands and ownership, the person proposing to remove livestock from any county of Wyoming to any such open market shall fill out and sign a certificate on a form approved by the board. The form shall include an agreement providing that the livestock listed on the certificate will not be diverted en route from the destination shown unless and until an inspection for brands and ownership has been made by an authorized Wyoming brand inspector, unless the diversion is to an open market where Wyoming brand inspection is maintained or where a brand inspection is made which substantially complies with the brand inspection laws of this state pursuant to an agreement entered into under W.S. 11-20-201(c). It shall further provide that in case of diversion of all or any part of the shipment the livestock diverted will be held at some convenient place, separate and apart from other livestock, until inspected, and the shipper will pay the necessary expenses incurred by the inspector and the legal inspection fees. The board shall establish a fee to be charged for use of the form authorized by this section. The fee for this form shall not exceed one dollar ($1.00) per head. The form authorized by this section shall not be issued until all fees required by W.S. 11-6-210 have been paid in full and may be collected at the time the form is issued by the issuing party. A blanket bond or individual bonds shall be executed to the state with good and sufficient surety in an amount determined by the board, conditioned for the full and faithful performance of any issuer of the forms and collecting of fees pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except on demand of the shipper, the inspector is not required to inspect any horses, mules, cattle or sheep, consigned directly to any open market where Wyoming brand inspection is maintained. If the shipper demands a prior inspection, the inspection shall be made and the legal inspection fee charged and collected. Inspection at point of origin does not exempt the shipment from inspection for brands and ownership, nor the shipper from payment of inspection fees at the open market destination.</p>
                  <p>(d) The form authorized by this section may be denied, suspended or revoked by the board after proper hearing as provided by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, and a finding that the person to whom the permit is granted has violated any of the brand inspection laws.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board may issue an out-of-state accustomed range permit for the movement of livestock from an accustomed range or ranch in Wyoming to a noncontiguous accustomed range or ranch in another state provided the applicant and the accustomed range meet the requirements of this subsection and criteria established by rules of the board. The movement shall be for the purpose of pasturing, grazing, ranging or feeding the livestock or other board approved movement that is considered necessary for normal ranch management operating conditions. The movement shall not be for the purpose of changing ownership. A permit under this section may be issued only to bona fide owners or Wyoming resident lessees of ranch lands headquartered within Wyoming or their authorized employees. As used in this section, an "out-of-state accustomed range or ranch" means a range or ranch that has been used for a period of time or purpose specified by the board and which use can be verified by brand inspection records. A permit may be denied by the board after a finding that the person applying for a permit has violated a brand inspection law, including a provision of this section or a board rule or regulation.</p>
                  <p>(b) No person shall move animals pursuant to a permit under this section until a brand inspector has inspected the animals and collected the fee imposed by W.S. 11-20-402. The owner of livestock moved under the permit shall attest in writing that it is intended that the livestock shall be returned to this state prior to a change in ownership. If a change of ownership occurs before the livestock are returned to this state, the owner shall notify the brand inspector who performed the inspection and shall pay all fees imposed under W.S. 11-6-210 and 11-20-401 with credit granted for any fee imposed by W.S. 11-20-402(a)(viii).</p>

The livestock may then be legally shipped or removed from any county in Wyoming to any other county, state or country, provided they are accompanied by a board authorized bill of sale and a board issued fleet permit which references the prior certificate of inspection pursuant to W.S. 11-20-216.</p>

Providing false proof of ownership shall be grounds for the revocation of the permit and shall be punished pursuant to W.S. 11-20-208. All livestock covered under the permit authorized under this section are subject to reinspection by a board authorized brand inspector and any applicable fees shall be assessed.</p>

                <p>(vii) The licensee is carrying on the business of a livestock market without filing and maintaining a valid surety bond in conformity with W.S. 11-22-107;</p>
                <p>(viii) The licensee is carrying on the business of a livestock market while his current liabilities exceed his current assets;</p>

                <p>(a) No person shall take up and retain possession of an estray except in the county where he resides and is a freeholder, nor unless the animal is found on lands owned, leased, or controlled by him or his duly authorized agents. When any person takes up an estray he shall immediately notify an inspector who shall inspect or cause to be inspected the estray for brands and other evidence of ownership and make a diligent effort to learn or determine ownership of the animal. The inspector may cause any estray to be held for not more than ten (10) days after the inspection to enable him to complete his investigation of ownership. If the estray is claimed by an owner, the bill for feed and care incurred by the inspector must be paid by the claimant. If the rightful owner cannot be found, or when found, refuses or fails to pay the charges for feed and care of the estray, the inspector shall order the estray be disposed of. Incurred charges for feed and care by the inspector and reasonable shipping and disposal expense shall be paid from the proceeds of the disposal. The net proceeds, if any, received from the disposal of the estray after deduction of authorized expenses, shall be forwarded to the estray fund of the board or its agency. The board or agency shall hold the proceeds in a special fund known as estray fund until paid to the rightful owner of the estray or otherwise disposed of according to law.</p>
                <p>(b) If the proceeds of the disposal of any estray are insufficient to pay all legitimate expenses, the deficiency shall be paid by the board or its agency.</p>

                <p>(i) Wyoming state institutions or to nonprofit organizations for no more than the board's cost for disposal, processing and delivery; or</p>
                <p>(ii) For profit entities at market cost for the processed meat.</p>

                <p>(a) No owner or person having custody or charge of livestock shall permit the livestock to run at large in any fenced public highways in Wyoming as defined in W.S. 31-1-101. Livestock shall not be picketed on a public highway right-of-way from one (1) hour before sundown to one (1) hour after sunrise. If livestock are picketed on a public highway and escape, the owner or person having custody or charge of the livestock is deemed to have permitted the livestock to run at large in violation of this section. No livestock shall be picketed on an interstate or national defense highway as defined in W.S. 31-18-801(a)(xvi).</p>
                <p>(b) Any person or corporation violating this section shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) and in addition shall pay all damage done by the livestock. The provisions of this section do not apply to livestock drifting into lanes or fenced roads in going to or returning from their accustomed ranges.</p>
                <p>(c) Any sheriff, deputy sheriff, livestock brand inspector, or officer or trooper of the Wyoming highway patrol, after notification to the owner of livestock described in subsection (a) of this section, if known, shall within four (4) hours remove the livestock from the public highway, impound the same in the nearest convenient place where feed and water are available and immediately notify the owner, if known, of the action. If ownership is not known, the impounding officer shall report his action to an inspector. The inspector shall make a diligent effort to ascertain ownership of the impounded livestock, and for this purpose may hold the livestock not more than ten (10) days. If unable to determine ownership, the inspector shall dispose of the impounded livestock. Reasonable transportation and disposal expenses shall be paid from the proceeds of the disposal, if any.</p>
                <p>(d) A removal fee of not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00) per head shall be allowed for the expense incurred in removing livestock from any public highway and an impounding fee for expenses incurred for the feed and care of the animal shall be allowed the person responsible for feed and care of the livestock removed. The inspector is responsible for collection and payment to the rightful claimants of removal and impounding fees when impounded livestock is surrendered to the owner. Upon disposal, the total amount of removal and impounding fees shall be made known to the selling agency at the market or slaughter plant by the inspector and shall constitute a first claim on the net proceeds of the livestock after shipping and disposal expenses have been paid, and shall be forwarded by the selling agency to the claimant.</p>
                <p>(e) Should the proceeds of the disposition of any impounded animal be insufficient to pay all legitimate shipping and disposal expenses and the removal and impounding fees approved by the inspector, the deficiency shall be paid by the board or its agency.</p>
                <p>(f) The net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of the impounded livestock after deduction of removal, impounding, trucking and disposal expenses, shall be forwarded to the estray account of the board. The board shall hold the proceeds until paid to the rightful owner of the livestock or otherwise disposed of according to law.</p>
                <p>(g) A peace officer may remove, destroy or otherwise dispose of an animal injured on a state highway after a reasonable attempt to locate the owner of a salvageable animal or a game warden in the case of a wild animal. If reasonably possible, the peace officer shall contact the brand inspector before removing, destroying or disposing of livestock. The carcass of an animal killed on a state highway shall be disposed of by highway maintenance crews. If the owner desires, he may claim the carcass from the maintenance crew. The crews shall report to the inspector brands, marks, tags or other identification. The inspector shall endeavor to establish ownership of the animal and notify the owner in writing or notify the local game warden as may be appropriate. Notwithstanding W.S. 24-1-112 and as part of their duties, any peace officer, inspector or other person acting under this section may, but is not obligated to, attempt to repair any fencing through which an animal has gained improper access to the area in which the animal is found.</p>

A fine imposed by the commission shall not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). Suspensions of a license may be for any period of time, but shall be commensurate with the seriousness of the offense.</p>

No permit shall be granted to any city, town, county, county fair board or any corporation or association except upon the express condition that it shall not, by any lease, contract, understanding or arrangement of whatever kind or nature, grant, assign or turn over to any person, corporation or association the operation or management of the pari-mutuel event permitted under this act or of the pari-mutuel system of wagering or in any manner permit any person, corporation or association to retain any of the money received for admission to the race meeting or from the operations of the pari-mutuel system. The commission shall revoke the permit of any permittee for any violation of the foregoing condition and such acts are a violation of this act. The permit is effective only for the times and at the places for which issued. In addition to all other fees and charges, there shall be charged before issuance of a permit a daily fee established by the commission to defray expenses of enforcing this act.</p>

                <p>(ii) Pay an amount equal to one-quarter percent (1/4%) of the total amount wagered attributable to historic pari-mutuel events and one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the total amount wagered attributable to live pari-mutuel events, shown by the report to the commission, to be credited by the state treasurer to a separate account, in the manner indicated in subsection (d) of this section;</p>
                <p>(iii) Pay an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the total amount wagered attributable to historic pari-mutuel events, shown by the report to the commission, to be transferred by the commission to the county and the city or town in which the permittee is located, in equal shares, or to the county alone if the permittee is not located within the boundaries of a city or town. The county, city or town receiving an amount under this paragraph may credit that amount to the state fair account upon a majority vote of the county's, city's or town's governing body; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Pay an amount equal to one-quarter percent (1/4%) of the total amount wagered attributable to historic pari-mutuel events, shown by the report to the commission, to be credited to the legislative stabilization reserve account.</p>

                <p>(d) All sums paid to the commission under this act except contributions from permittees to the breeder award fund, amounts paid under paragraphs (b)(iii) and (iv) of this section, fines and penalties shall be credited to the pari-mutuel account which shall be used by the commission for the payment of all expenses incurred in enforcing this act. On a quarterly basis, the commission shall transfer amounts within the account in excess of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) to the state treasurer for credit to the legislative stabilization reserve account. All fines and penalties collected under this act shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited as provided in W.S. 8-1-109. The state treasurer shall pay out of the account all warrants drawn by the state auditor, upon vouchers issued and signed by the president, vice-president or executive secretary of the commission.

                <p>(f) The commission may issue, amend or refuse to issue permits in its discretion.</p>
                <p>(g) The rules of racing set forth by the commission shall be made available to all participants of each event, and violations shall be misdemeanors punishable as provided herein.</p>
                <p>(h) The commission shall observe and supervise the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering under permits issued by the commission and shall appoint one (1) of its members or employ one (1) or more persons to represent the commission in the administration and enforcement of this act and in the supervision of the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering and the events in connection therewith under each permit issued. Representatives of the commission shall have access to the events and to the pari-mutuel booths and records and shall be paid an amount determined by the commission plus expenses and mileage as fixed by law for state officers, payment therefor to be made by the state auditor.</p>

The contribution shall be derived from the net proceeds of the race meet revenues, other than the permittee's share of the pari-mutuel wagering handle. Contributions shall be used only for breeder awards.</p>
                <p>(k) The commission may authorize advance deposit pari- mutuel wagering at any premise where a pari-mutuel event is authorized, provided that the licensee shall:</p>

                <p>(vi) Include a statement in all forms of advertising for advance deposit pari-mutuel wagering accounts that "minors are not allowed to open or have access to advance deposit pari- mutuel wagering accounts."</p>
                <p>(m) The commission may license, regulate and charge a source market fee to persons outside of Wyoming who conduct pari-mutuel wagering on simulcast races and who accept wagers from Wyoming residents at out-of-state simulcast facilities, and shall require out-of-state simulcast facilities licensed under this section to be maintained and operated in accordance with the laws of this state and rules of the commission. Source market fees imposed on persons licensed under this subsection shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross receipts of all pari-mutuel wagering by Wyoming residents conducted by such persons at out-of-state simulcast facilities. Source market fees collected annually under this subsection shall be distributed as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) Seventy-five percent (75%) to the live flat track permittees in this state on a number of live days basis, to be used to enhance purses at those tracks;</p>

                <p>(a) Any person owning or having in his possession or charge any livestock or domesticated buffalo which breaches into any lawful enclosure belonging to someone other than the owner of the animal, is liable to the party sustaining the injury for all damages sustained by reason of such breaching. Damages may be recovered in a civil action before any court having jurisdiction, or by arbitration, each party to select a property holder and the two (2) arbitrators to select a third. The arbitrators shall be sworn before a judge of a circuit court before entering upon their duties. The arbitrators shall carefully examine the fence and assess the damage done, examine witnesses under oath, one (1) of them to administer the oath to the witnesses, and make a written report signed by at least two (2) of the arbitrators, to the circuit court in the county in which the damage is sustained. The finding of the arbitration, as provided for in this section, shall within three (3) days after rendered, be filed with a judge of a circuit court in the county where the trespass was committed, who shall enter the cost upon his docket and proceed to issue execution therein as in other cases originally commenced before him.</p>
                <p>(b) The party sustaining the damage shall notify the owner or person having in charge the offending animals, of the damage and the probable amount if he knows to whom the animals belong and if the owner or keeper resides within the county where the damage was committed.</p>
                <p>(c) The person suffering damage may restrain and keep in custody as many of the offending animals as are equal in value to the damage done, until the finding of the court or arbitration is ascertained, unless before suit the amount of his claim and expense of keeping the animals is tendered to him.</p>
                <p>(d) If, upon trial of any action under subsection (a) of this section, it appears the plaintiff's enclosure is a lawful fence, he shall be allowed to prove the amount of damage sustained and if he has retained in custody the animals committing the damage, the amount of expense incurred for keeping the animals. Any judgment rendered for damages, costs and expenses against the defendant shall be a lien upon the animals committing the damage. If it appears upon trial that the plaintiff's enclosure is not a lawful fence or that no damage was sustained, judgment shall be rendered against the plaintiff for costs of suit and damages sustained by defendant.</p>
                <p>(e) If upon trial it appears the defendant is not the owner or person in charge of the offending animals, he shall be discharged from the action with his costs, and the suit may proceed against a defendant whose name is unknown. If, at the commencement of the action, the plaintiff does not know the name of the owner or keeper of the offending animals, he may bring suit against a defendant unknown.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>11-31-301. Public nuisance; notice; penalties; rules and regulations; animal control districts and officers.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A board of county commissioners may declare the running at large of any specified animals in unincorporated areas within the county limits a public nuisance.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notice of such a declaration shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county and notices may be placed in appropriate locations. The notice shall specify any regulations necessary and convenient for animal control and shall state that:</p>
                  <p>(i) It is a public nuisance for one (1) or more specified animals to be running at large in unincorporated areas;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A fine shall be imposed on the owner of such animal and restitution for any damages to person or property caused by the animal shall be made by the owner;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Dogs or other animals, whose ownership cannot be determined, may be destroyed.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon the filing of any complaint, the county sheriff may arrest or issue a summons to the owner of any animal which is running at large or has attacked a person. A first conviction is punishable by a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00). Each subsequent conviction is punishable by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).</p>
                  <p>(d) A dog injuring or killing livestock may be killed by the owner of the livestock or his agent or any peace officer.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any animal attacking any person in a vicious manner or that bites any person may be impounded by the county sheriff or animal control officer and held in quarantine for at least ten (10) days or as long as necessary as determined by the Wyoming state health officer after the attack to determine whether the animal has any disease which may be communicated to humans. Home quarantine may be allowed as determined by the animal control officer or the county sheriff if the animal's owner or custodian presents a valid rabies vaccination certificate showing the animal has been vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. The costs of impoundment, quarantine and testing shall be paid by the owner or custodian of the animal. Any animal which attacks any person in a vicious manner may be destroyed or the owner or custodian of the animal may be fined not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00), or both. Proof of the fact that the animal has bitten or attacked any person at any place where a person is legally entitled to be is evidence that the animal is vicious within the meaning of this section. A copy of any animal control officer report regarding the animal bite shall be submitted to the state health officer.</p>
                  <p>(f) Upon the declaration of a public nuisance, the county sheriff may dispose of any unlicensed animals, the ownership of which cannot be determined.</p>
                  <p>(g) A board of county commissioners may enact regulations relative to dogs running at large, vicious dogs, dogs running wild game or livestock or acts by other animals which shall carry out the purposes of this section. The county sheriff shall and a county animal control officer or any other peace officer may enforce these regulations to protect persons and property.</p>
                  <p>(h) A board of county commissioners may require an annual county license or tag for animals within their jurisdiction upon payment of a fee of not more than ten dollars ($10.00). Funds collected pursuant to this subsection may be used for animal control or for the maintenance of animal control centers for either purpose.</p>
                  <p>(j) A board of county commissioners may establish and provide for the operation of animal control districts which may encompass all or parts of the unincorporated area of the county and may cooperate with municipalities in a joint animal control program. Joint animal control programs may employ joint animal control officers who have the authority to enforce the animal control regulations and ordinances of each of the participating entities.</p>
                  <p>(k) As used in W.S. 11-31-301 "animal" means a dog or cat.</p>
                  <p>(m) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section regarding impounding an animal to determine disease status, nothing in this section shall apply to any livestock guarding animal which is actively engaged in protecting livestock. Except in the case of gross or willful negligence, no liability shall accrue to the owner, or his agent, of any livestock guarding animal for any injury to any person or animal received from any livestock guarding animal which was actively engaged in protecting livestock.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board shall make loans only upon the following terms and conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) The loan shall be secured by a duly recorded first or second mortgage as approved by the board on the farm lands within this state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Every mortgage shall contain an agreement providing for repayment of the entire amount of the loan and interest upon a certain date or in several specified payments, or on an amortization plan of annual or semiannual installments so computed as to pay the interest on the loan according to terms of the mortgage and such amounts to be applied on the principal as will terminate the debt within an agreed period of not less than five (5) years nor more than thirty (30) years.</p>
                  <p>The method of repayment is at the option of the board.</p>
                  <p>(b) After five (5) years from date of the mortgage, additional payments for part or all of the principal may be made on the annual or semiannual payment date under such rules and regulations as the board may prescribe. On the application of the borrower the board may provide in the mortgage for the payment of interest only during the first five (5) years and thereafter for the payment of both interest and principal on the amortization plan. Any loan may be paid in full before the expiration of five (5) years upon payment of a ten dollar ($10.00) fee to be paid into the general fund. Any loan paid in full after five (5) years from the date thereof, the ten dollars ($10.00) fee shall not be collected.</p>
                  <p>(c) Repealed by Laws 1987, ch. 242, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding the loan term limitation specified in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, the board may reamortize farm loan payments over an additional number of years which together with the years remaining on the original term shall create a new term not to exceed thirty (30) years, at the same interest rate as that in effect at the time of reamortization for loans being made under W.S. 11-34-101 through 11-34-130, when in the judgment of the board the reduced payments resulting from reamortization of the loan will provide adequate financial benefit to assure with reasonable certainty the ultimate repayment of the loan. Any borrower requesting reamortization shall have the burden of showing that reamortization will significantly improve the financial viability of the agricultural operation. No loan shall be reamortized if, in the sole judgment of the board, the borrower is in sound financial condition and reamortization is not necessary to secure repayment of the loan, or if reamortization will not provide sufficient financial benefit to avoid the imminent failure of the borrower's operation. Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the reamortization of water development project loans.</p>

                  <p>(a) All mortgages and accompanying promissory note or notes taken by the board for monies loaned shall run to state loan and investment board as mortgagee or payee, and all titles to property taken by the board shall run to the board as grantee. The board may control, manage, lease and dispose of the property, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The board may lease any or all property for oil and gas for a primary term up to ten (10) years and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities and extend the term of existing oil and gas leases in good standing for as long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities and for coal and other mineral purposes for terms not exceeding ten (10) years, with the preferential right in each coal or other mineral lessee to renew the lease for successive periods of ten (10) years each;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The board may make and establish rules and regulations governing the issuance of mineral leases and covering the conduct of development and mining operations to be carried on thereunder;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Mineral leases may be issued upon monthly or annual minimum rental payment basis as fixed by the board, with payments annually applied against any royalty as shall accrue for the same lease year by the terms of the lease, which royalty, as to lands leased for oil or gas shall not be less than five percent (5%) of all oil and gas produced and saved from and not used in operations on the lands under the lease, and royalty of not less than five cents ($.05) per ton on coal produced from the lands under any lease for coal purposes, the royalty to be paid on mine run of coal.</p>
                  <p>(b) No mineral lease is assignable or transferable except with written consent of the board. It shall require the lessee's full compliance with all rules and regulations adopted by the board and compliance with all terms of the lease. All mineral leases shall be separate and distinct from each lease of the land for grazing or agricultural purposes. Rules and regulations adopted by the board shall provide for joint use of the lands for grazing and agricultural or mineral purposes without undue interference by the lessees under any class of leases with lessees under any other class. The board, on behalf of the state and its lessee in any mineral lease may join in the interest of conservation and greater ultimate recovery of oil and gas, in fair and equitable cooperative or unit plans of development or operation of oil and gas pools, with the United States government and its lessees or permittees, or others, and the board may modify and change any terms and conditions of any oil and gas lease as mutually agreed by the lessor and lessee to conform to the terms of any lease to the cooperative or unit plan and to effectuate proper operations thereunder. The changes may include extension of the term of years applicable to any lease for the full period of time during which the cooperative or unit plan may remain in effect.</p>
                  <p>(c) When a cooperative or unit agreement is terminated or ceases to be effective as to lands upon which there is no production of oil or gas, the lease covering the lands shall remain in effect for two (2) years from the date the lands ceased to be subject to the agreement, or for the remaining length of the term of the original lease, whichever is greater, and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from the lands in accordance with the requirements of the original lease.</p>
                  <p>(d) The terms of any lease issued under this section for land on which actual drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of its primary term and are being diligently prosecuted at that time shall be extended for one (1) year and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.</p>
                  <p>(e) If land acquired by the board and upon which improvements for mineral operations and other improvements have been made, are sold as to both surface and mineral rights, or if the lands are leased for minerals to other than the owner of the mineral improvements, the purchaser or new lessee shall pay the owner of the improvements the fair value thereof at a mutually agreed price. If agreement cannot be promptly reached the price shall be fixed by appraisement under the direction of the board. As used in this subsection "improvements" means improvements which are used or useful and necessary for subsequent operation of the land for mineral purposes and the price shall include the fair value of the work previously done in the development of the property if it is of practical use in future mineral operation. No well drilled on the land for oil or gas which does not produce either in commercial quantities, and no shaft, tunnel or drift from which coal or other minerals have been substantially exhausted shall be considered improvements for the purposes of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(f) The board may sell or otherwise dispose of property at a price not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the appraised value and upon terms determined by the board which shall adopt rules and regulations governing such sales. When land is sold which was acquired by the board through the foreclosure of any farm loan mortgage provided for by this act, the board shall not reserve any part of, or interest in, the mineral estate. When land otherwise acquired by the board is sold, the board may reserve all or any part of the mineral content of the land and the right to use so much of the surface of the land as it considers convenient or necessary in connection with mineral operations thereon, together with all needed rights of ingress and egress, but the board in each case shall appropriately provide for indemnification of the surface owner against all surface damages caused by mineral operations on the land.</p>
                  <p>(g) The board may lease for agricultural and grazing purposes any lands acquired by it on such terms and conditions as it prescribes and adopt rules and regulations it considers necessary in facilitating the leases.</p>
                  <p>(h) Revenue received by the board under this section from agricultural, grazing and mineral leases of lands acquired by foreclosure shall be credited to the loss reserve account as provided by W.S. 11-34-202(e).</p>

                  <p>(a) Any foreclosure of any mortgage provided for by this act shall be made in the usual manner, either by civil action or by advertisement as the board may direct. In cases of foreclosure the attorney general shall render all services needed in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, and the costs, fees and expenses may be taxed in like manner and to the same effect as if the state of Wyoming were a natural person. Payment of proceeds upon foreclosure shall be made in accordance with W.S. 34-4-113. All monies received by the state from sale of the land acquired by foreclosure or by redemption of land sold on foreclosure, in excess of the amount owing to the appropriate permanent fund account and the interest due thereon, shall be credited to the loss reserve account as provided by W.S. 11-34-202(e). The board may extend the time of payment of any interest or installment payment due on any farm loan for as long as the board deems proper, and distribute the defaulted payments including interest, over undue payments in a manner and under terms the board deems just, each loan to be judged on its own merits without regard to any general rule. It is the intention of this section to authorize the board to consider and determine whether any mortgages executed by virtue of this act shall be foreclosed or renewed, with or without penalty, but no renewal shall extend beyond the due date of the original loan or any extension of the term by reamortization authorized by W.S. 11-34-113(d).</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed By Laws 2010, Ch. 69, § 204.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section the state loan and investment board by unanimous vote may accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure, provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) The board determines any remaining liability is not collectible; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any loss to any permanent fund resulting from the acceptance of the deed in lieu of foreclosure is restored as provided by W.S. 11-34-202(f).</p>

                  <p>Every borrower shall pay interest on defaulted payments at a rate to be determined by the board not to exceed a ten percent (10%) annual percentage rate. By express covenant in his mortgage deed the borrower shall agree to pay when due all interest, taxes, liens, judgments, assessments and insurance lawfully assessed against the mortgaged land. Taxes, liens, judgments, assessments or insurance not paid when due and paid by the mortgagee become a part of the mortgage debt and shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the board not to exceed a ten percent (10%) annual percentage rate. Every borrower shall insure buildings on the lands mortgaged to the satisfaction of the board. Insurance shall be made payable to the mortgagee as its interest may appear at the time of loss, and at the option of the mortgagee subject to the general regulations of the board. Insurance proceeds received may be used to pay for reconstruction of the buildings destroyed.</p>

The county assessor shall list and assess the property for taxation purposes, and the state loan and investment board shall pay any tax due for the year in its entirety prior to December 31 of that year and any other year in which the board owns the property. If redemption is made of the property at any time during the year in which the state loan and investment board has paid the property taxes due, the person redeeming the property shall be liable to the state loan and investment board for any taxes paid.

                  <p>(d) Following a general fund appropriation by the legislature for administrative expenses, amounts expended pursuant to the appropriation shall be transferred monthly from the account provided by subsection (a) of this section to the general fund as provided by W.S. 9-4-205(b) for the highway fund and the special revenue fund in certain instances. Revenue currently in the account formerly provided for by W.S. 11-34-202(a), (b) and (c), as those subsections existed prior to the creation of this subsection, may be expended for purposes formerly authorized until July 1, 1982 at which time the revenue within the account shall be credited to the account provided by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

If the funds in the loss reserve account are insufficient to restore the full amount of the loss, the board shall submit a detailed report of the loss to the legislature and shall request an appropriation to restore the balance of the loss to the permanent fund account entitled thereto.</p>

If the marketing order affects directly both producers and handlers of a particular commodity, the control committee shall be composed of both producers and handlers. The number of producers or handlers upon any control committee shall be designated in the marketing order.</p>

                <p>(ii) That the order will help approach and maintain such comparable general economic conditions at as rapid a rate as is feasible in view of the demand for any dairy product;</p>
                <p>(iii) That the order will help to prevent economic waste of agricultural resources because of improper preparation of any dairy product for market, because of lack of uniform grading and inspection or because of excessive shipments to markets;</p>
                <p>(iv) That the order will help to insure a beneficial future for any dairy product;</p>
                <p>(v) That the order will help to protect the interests of consumers of any dairy product in assuring an adequate supply.</p>

                <p>(C) Comparable compensation received by persons engaged in other means of earning a livelihood for themselves and their families, as well as any other appropriate factors.</p>
                <p>(iv) The purchasing power of consumers;</p>
                <p>(v) The level of prices of commodities, services and articles that dairy farmers buy; and</p>

                <p><shortTitle>11-38-108. Assessments generally; refund of contributions; penalty for failure to pay or remit monies due or collected.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The rate of assessment may be adjusted from time to time by the wheat marketing commission in order to cover any later findings by the wheat marketing commission of the estimated expenses or actual expenses that may be incurred in connection with any research, marketing, utilization and promotion program. The assessment shall not exceed two and one- half cents ($.025) per bushel.</p>
                <p>(b) All assessments made and levied pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be paid by the respective grower who is primarily liable therefor. An assessment shall be collected from the grower by the first handler thereof, warehouse, or elevator operator, and the handler shall remit to the director all assessments so collected not later than the fifteenth day of the month next succeeding the quarter in which the wheat is sold or contracted in commercial channels. Any handler within or without the state of Wyoming who fails or neglects to collect an assessment from any grower and to remit the collection to the director is guilty of a violation of this act.</p>
                <p>(c) In case of a pledge or mortgage of wheat as security for a loan made from a governmental agency the assessment shall be deducted from the proceeds of the loan at the time of the disbursement of the loan. In case of an overage of wheat at the time of settlement of the loan, the assessment shall be paid on the overage. In case of a shortage at the time of settlement of the loan, the over payment will be credited to the grower's account. In case of purchase agreements under the federal price support program, the assessment shall be made at the time of final settlement. Wheat stored in private or public storage within the state shall not be liable for assessment until sale is made or loan secured.</p>
                <p>(d) Any grower who by virtue of his activities or circumstances is within the meaning of the term "handler" as herein defined, or who shall sell, ship or otherwise dispose of wheat to a handler or other person or store wheat outside the jurisdiction of this act, shall forthwith remit to the director the full amount of the assessment due. Wheat originating from any state that collects a similar levy upon wheat, but bases assessment upon the location of the first sale taking place within its jurisdiction shall be treated as if the wheat were grown within the state of Wyoming, being first handled by a Wyoming handler. At the first commission meeting following July 1 of each year, the commission shall determine which states collect a similar levy and shall then notify all domestic handlers of those states.</p>
                <p>(e) A person who has paid any monies as provided in this act is entitled to a prompt refund of the contribution from the commission. A claim for refund shall be made to the commission not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days from the date of sale, on a form prescribed and furnished by the commission. The claim refund form shall be duly acknowledged by the person submitting the claim.</p>
                <p>(f) The commission, before processing and making refund, may require any additional information or affirmation under penalty of perjury it deems necessary to determine the validity of the claim for refund.</p>
                <p>(g) Any person who fails to pay or remit any monies due or collected as provided in this act is guilty of a misdemeanor. Failure to so remit on each sale for which such monies are payable constitutes a separate offense and is not affected by any refund either pending at the time of the offense or made at a later date. Upon conviction any person guilty of such misdemeanor shall be subject to a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00).</p>

                <p><shortTitle>11-40-104. Standards for Wyoming lean beef.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The committee shall establish quality standards for Wyoming lean beef in accordance with the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Cattle qualifying shall graze the summer before slaughter in Wyoming. The committee may increase the proportion of time the cattle must live in Wyoming, specifying that particular portions of their lives must be spent in Wyoming and may impose altitude requirements and geographic restrictions in whole or in part on any time spent outside Wyoming. The committee shall not impose any altitude requirement on cattle within Wyoming. For the purposes of these standards, cattle shall be deemed to be living within Wyoming even though the pasture where the cattle are grazing is outside Wyoming if those cattle:</p>
                <p>(A) Have free access to land within Wyoming; or</p>
                <p>(B) Are in a pasture located not more than twenty-five (25) miles from the Wyoming border and the owner of the cattle is a Wyoming resident who physically resides within Wyoming and has his principal place of business in Wyoming.</p>
                <p>(ii) Cattle qualifying shall be primarily grass fed cattle;</p>
                <p>(iii) Cattle shall not be held in close confinement except for short periods in connection with operations necessary in the management of the cattle, including but not limited to calving, branding, vaccinating, weaning, transportation and slaughter;</p>
                <p>(iv) Cattle qualifying shall have a hot carcass weight of at least four hundred (400) pounds. The committee may set a lighter minimum weight;</p>
                <p>(v) Cattle qualifying shall have an untrimmed fat depth over the rib eye muscle at the twelfth (12th) rib of less than or equal to three tenths (0.3) of one inch. The committee may decrease the amount of fat permitted under this standard and may establish additional standards for fat. Except for ground beef, the committee shall not establish any fat standard that would permit more than three tenths (0.3) of one inch of untrimmed fat over the rib eye muscle of the twelfth (12th) rib;</p>
                <p>(vi) Carcasses shall be electrically stimulated within one (1) hour after stunning. The committee may permit other treatments with similar effect in lieu of electrical stimulation and may eliminate this requirement if it no longer appears necessary to ensure adequate consumer acceptance;</p>
                <p>(vii) Cattle shall not exceed thirty-two (32) months in age. The committee may vary this standard or prescribe in its place a maturity level that is to be judged from the characteristics of the carcass. The committee may also establish a minimum age;</p>
                <p>(viii) Cattle shall not be given any growth promoting hormone;</p>
                <p>(ix) Cattle shall not be given subtherapeutic levels of any antibiotic. This standard shall not be construed as prohibiting the use of therapeutic levels of any antibiotic for therapeutic purposes.</p>
                <p>(b) For ground beef the committee shall establish separate standards which shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Provide for a fat content of twenty percent (20%) or less. The committee may establish a lower fat content standard;</p>
                <p>(ii) Include the same standards as are established pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i) through (iii), (viii) and (ix) of this section, but need not be consistent with the standards established pursuant to the balance of subsection (a) of this section;</p>
                <p>(iii) Provide any other standards that may be necessary for ground beef.</p>
                <p>(c) The committee may establish any additional quality standard which may be useful in:</p>
                <p>(i) Improving the quality of the product;</p>
                <p>(ii) Gaining consumer acceptance of the product;</p>
                <p>(iii) Assisting in the enforcement of the remaining standards; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Promoting human health and welfare through improvements in Wyoming lean beef.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>11-40-105. Licensing; use of trademark; royalty.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The committee may license any person to market Wyoming lean beef and use the label, trademark or trade name "Wyoming lean beef" who:</p>
                <p>(i) Pays an annual licensing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00);</p>
                <p>(ii) Pays an additional annual licensing fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each state or fraction thereof for which the licensee has obtained a geographically exclusive license;</p>
                <p>(iii) Agrees to pay the royalty required by subsection (h) of this section;</p>
                <p>(iv) Agrees to pay any additional royalty that may be established to support advertising and promotion programs;</p>
                <p>(v) Agrees to abide by the standards established for Wyoming lean beef and to market no beef as Wyoming lean beef that fails to meet the standards;</p>
                <p>(vi) Agrees to abide by applicable state and federal standards relating to public health and the slaughtering and preparation of meat for sale;</p>
                <p>(vii) Agrees to abide by any other terms of the license the committee deems appropriate provided that the committee may make no term for the purpose of creating a monopoly in the marketing of Wyoming lean beef.</p>
                <p>(b) The committee may give geographically exclusive licenses for markets outside Wyoming provided that the market shall not exceed the area the licensee can reasonably be expected to serve within a reasonable period of time and may be revoked in whole or in part for failure of the licensee to adequately supply the market with Wyoming lean beef. The committee may set specific volume of sales targets for the license to meet in order to retain a geographically exclusive license. If more than one (1) person applies for a geographically exclusive license for the same area the committee may divide the area or choose between the persons based on the criteria set forth in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                <p>(c) The issuance of a geographically exclusive license for a particular geographic area shall not prohibit other licensees from selling Wyoming lean beef directly to residents of the geographic area if the sales are for consumption and not for resale and are made within Wyoming or in response to mail or telephone solicitation originating within Wyoming or in response to an advertisement in a publication of national circulation. No geographically exclusive license shall include any of the state of Wyoming. No geographically exclusive license shall include more than twenty (20) of the states of the United States until the licensee has actually served the market within the states for which he is licensed.</p>
                <p>(d) The committee may reject, restrict, accept, or accept in part an application for a license to market Wyoming lean beef, or may choose between competing applicants based upon:</p>
                <p>(i) The financial strength of the applicant;</p>
                <p>(ii) The marketing expertise of the applicant and his specific marketing plans;</p>
                <p>(iii) The access of the applicant to a supply of Wyoming lean beef;</p>
                <p>(iv) The prior experience of the applicant in relevant businesses; and</p>
                <p>(v) Any other standards or criteria the committee deems appropriate.</p>
                <p>(e) The committee may deny, revoke, suspend or limit the license of anyone who:</p>
                <p>(i) Fails to abide by the provisions of subsection</p>
                <p>(a) of this section or any terms of the license;</p>
                <p>(ii) Is convicted of violating the public health laws of the United States or any state;</p>
                <p>(iii) Is convicted or has been convicted of any felony;</p>
                <p>(iv) Willfully or unintentionally but repeatedly markets beef as Wyoming lean beef which does not meet the quality standards for Wyoming lean beef.</p>
                <p>(f) Any retailer who is selling Wyoming lean beef furnished by any person licensed to sell Wyoming lean beef may use the "Wyoming lean beef" trademark or trade name in connection with any advertising or promotion of that beef. The committee may forbid licensees to furnish any Wyoming lean beef to any retailer who labels any other beef as Wyoming lean beef.</p>
                <p>(g) The committee may seek through legal action monetary damages from any person labeling or selling as Wyoming lean beef any beef which does not meet the quality standards for Wyoming lean beef. Damages recovered may be used to reimburse the state for any expenses it may have incurred in connection with the case and may be used for advertising and promotion to overcome any damage to the public image of Wyoming lean beef.</p>
                <p>(h) The committee shall annually set the royalty to be paid by licensees which shall be not less than fifty cents ($.50) per head and not more than five dollars ($5.00) per head and shall be designed to defray the expenses of the committee, the expenses of the inspection and enforcement program and give the state of Wyoming a return of eight percent (8%) per annum on the monies appropriated for the marketing of Wyoming lean beef by Chapter 199, Wyoming Session Laws 1985 and by any other legislative appropriation and spent by the University of Wyoming on the 1985 San Francisco simulated market test. The royalties shall be deposited in the general fund of the state except that fifty percent (50%) of any royalties in excess of the amount budgeted for the expenses of the committee, the inspection and enforcement program and repayment to the state shall be deposited in the University of Wyoming fund to the credit of the agricultural experiment station account.</p>

                <p>(b) The committee may require licenses to conduct any inspections of ranching or slaughter operations necessary to insure compliance with Wyoming lean beef standards. The committee may require that this inspection program complies with any requirements imposed by the federal government to insure that the quality standards are met or that claims made on any label for, or advertising concerning, Wyoming lean beef are valid. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the committee from having necessary inspections performed by employees of the department of agriculture or committee members or other appropriate persons.</p>

                <p>(a) The committee may provide for the collection of additional royalties on the sale of Wyoming lean beef to pay for advertising and promotion programs. Such royalties may be levied on all Wyoming lean beef sold to pay for national advertising and promotion programs or only on Wyoming lean beef sold in particular markets or through particular channels of distribution to pay for advertising aimed at those markets, or both. If the volume of sales on which royalty is paid in a market in the previous year is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or more, the additional royalties may be imposed on that market only with the consent of the persons paying two-thirds (2/3) of the royalties paid in that previous year. The committee shall define as necessary the markets and may classify sales as being in more than one (1) market. Any other assessment method may be used in whole or in part with the consent of all persons liable for the assessment. The royalties or assessment shall be deposited in a separate account and shall be expended for advertising, promotion, product development and the expenses connected therewith in the market for which the royalty or assessment is collected. The committee may authorize the expenditure of funds in the account or may delegate that authority to the subcommittees provided by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(b) To administer the advertising and promotion campaigns, the committee shall appoint a subcommittee for each market for which funds are separately collected. The subcommittee shall consist of at least one (1) voting member of the committee and any nonvoting members of the committee representing persons who pay additional royalties or assessments for that market and who shall be entitled to vote within the subcommittee. The full committee may give the subcommittee guidelines and directions it shall follow and may choose to reserve to itself the right to veto all subcommittee actions or particular classes of subcommittee actions. When considering actions or information the knowledge of which could give competitors a commercial advantage, the subcommittee may hold executive sessions.</p>

This trademark or trade name for beef shall be used to designate a product which may be produced with some period in a conventional feed lot. For this brand of beef the committee may:</p>
                <p>(i) Establish standards as necessary which shall be the same as the standards established for Wyoming lean beef pursuant to W.S. 11-40-104(a)(i), (viii) and (ix), but need not be consistent with other standards established for Wyoming lean beef;</p>
                <p>(ii) Provide for a program for inspection and enforcement of the standards;</p>
                <p>(iii) Provide for licensing of persons to market the beef in the same manner as licensing is provided for Wyoming lean beef;</p>
