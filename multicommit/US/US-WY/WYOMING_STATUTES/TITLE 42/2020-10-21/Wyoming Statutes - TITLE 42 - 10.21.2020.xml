                  <p>(e) In administering this section and in addition to other requirements imposed under this chapter and the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act and federal rule and regulation, the department shall by rule and regulation:</p>
                  <p>(i) Limit assistance payable under W.S. 42-2-104 to five (5) years for any assistance unit within a lifetime, regardless of location. Time spent on assistance funded with federal funds and time spent on assistance funded with state funds, shall be added together in determining the time spent on assistance for the purposes of this section. Adults who previously received assistance as a dependent child, excluding minor parents, shall be allowed up to the five (5) year lifetime limit under their own assistance unit. For minor parents only, one (1) year in the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program prior to reaching the age of majority shall be counted against the five (5) year lifetime limit. Months of assistance received for an eligible dependent child by a nonparent caretaker relative who is not included in the calculation of the performance payment to the dependent child shall not count toward the nonparent caretaker relative's lifetime limit. Individuals who have received assistance under W.S. 42-2-104 for three (3) or more years as of January 1, 1997, shall be eligible for two (2) additional years of assistance used after January 1, 1997. Any individual who is totally physically or mentally disabled as specified by department rules, or who is a caretaker and stays at home to provide full- time care for a totally disabled or incapacitated immediate family member who resides with the caretaker because no other reasonable alternative, as determined by the department, is available to provide care and who otherwise qualifies for assistance under W.S. 42-2-104 shall not be subject to the limitation imposed under this paragraph. For an individual who is such a caretaker, the department shall waive any work requirements that unduly interfere with the provision of care and may waive other program requirements as appropriate. For purposes of this section an individual is totally disabled or incapacitated if he has a physical or mental impairment to the extent that it prevents the individual from achieving independent living, full-time employment, or participation in job training programs that will reasonably lead to independent living and monetary self sufficiency. The department may consult a licensed physician or other appropriate professional to make its determination of disability or incapacitation. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit the department from requiring recipients to maintain, improve or enhance employment and self-sufficiency efforts and activities. The department shall waive time limits, and may waive other program requirements as provided in paragraph (viii) of this subsection, as allowed under sections 402(a)(7)(A)(iii) and 408(a)(7)(A)(iii) of the federal Social Security Act, as amended by P.L. 104-193, for a period not to exceed two (2) years for individuals who are fleeing for personal safety or for the safety of their children or who have been victimized by domestic violence or who are at risk of further domestic violence. The department may extend assistance up to one (1) year under either the federal or state program in addition to the five (5) year limitation imposed under this paragraph for the following reasons:</p>
                  <p>(A) Repealed By Laws 1997, ch. 196, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(B) Continuation of education leading toward an associate or a baccalaureate degree under the state funded program only;</p>
                  <p>(C) Abandonment.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Require an unmarried parent under the age of eighteen (18) and the dependent child of the minor parent to reside in the household of a parent or in a supervised setting with an adult relative or court appointed guardian or custodian in order to qualify for assistance under W.S. 42-2-104, unless the minor parent is emancipated under law. Assistance under this paragraph shall be payable to the parent, relative or court appointed guardian or custodian on behalf of the minor parent and the dependent child. The income and resources of the parents shall be considered in determining eligibility for assistance under W.S. 42-2-104. If the minor custodial parent is living with a qualified person other than a parent and except for exemptions specified by department rule and regulation, the department shall through local child support enforcement agencies, enforce child support obligations of the parents of each minor parent, including the parents of the noncustodial minor parent. The department shall waive the requirements of this subsection if the only available households contain an individual who has been convicted of violating W.S. 6-4-402 or who has been charged with violating W.S. 6-4-402 and the charges have not received final disposition. The department shall assist law enforcement officials and the family of a minor mother to pursue the filing of criminal charges against the father of the minor mother's child if the minor mother conceived her child while under sixteen (16) years of age and the father was at least four (4) years older than the minor mother at the time of conception;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Limit assistance payable under W.S. 42-2-104 for the year 2008 as follows:</p>

                  <p>Beginning July 1, 2009 and annually thereafter, the maximum payment level shall be adjusted for the percentage change in the Wyoming cost-of-living index for the previous fiscal year as determined by the division of economic analysis of the department of administration and information.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Establish only one (1) earned income disregard for determining assistance payable under W.S. 42-2-104 at six hundred dollars ($600.00) per month for any one (1) recipient. For married couples the earned income disregard shall be one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00) per month. The department may in addition establish an additional individual earned income disregard tailored to the individual person as part of that person's self-sufficiency plan developed pursuant to paragraph (v) of this subsection, provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) Such an individual earned income disregard shall be available only during time periods when the person is working at paid employment enough average number of hours per week to qualify as working for the purposes of section 407 of P.L. 104-193;</p>
                  <p>(B) The amount disregarded shall not exceed six dollars and fifty cents ($6.50) per hour except that in high cost of living areas as defined by the department it shall not exceed seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) per hour;</p>
                  <p>(C) The disregard shall be structured to allow one-half (1/2) of the person's preemployment personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) grant for a period not to exceed six (6) months and one-quarter (1/4) of the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) grant for an additional period not to exceed six (6) months;</p>
                  <p>(D) The one-half (1/2) grant in the first period may be paid from either state funds or federal funds and shall count toward the five (5) year limit established by W.S. 42-2- 103(e). The one-quarter (1/4) grant in the second period shall be paid from state maintenance of effort funds and shall not be subject to the time limits established by W.S. 42-2-103(e);</p>
                  <p>(E) The use of the individual earned income disregard may be conditioned upon successful completion of other portions of the person's self-sufficiency plan;</p>
                  <p>(F) The decision to allow an individual earned income disregard in a particular case is discretionary with the department and the department's decision is not subject to judicial review;</p>
                  <p>(G) The individual earned income disregard shall be used only to the extent the department determines funds are available and are not needed for other purposes with higher priority.</p>
                  <p>(v) In accordance with guidelines and criteria prescribed by rule and regulation of the department and unless otherwise qualifying for a good cause exemption pursuant to rule and regulation of the department, require the development of and adherence to a self-sufficiency plan with guidelines and assistance provided by the department, as a condition for benefit eligibility under the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program. A self-sufficiency plan including timely completion of an approved educational program complying with W.S. 42-2-109(a) shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this subsection if adhered to. Any person not qualifying for a good cause exemption and failing to comply with this paragraph shall be sanctioned under the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program. Subject to procedure prescribed by department regulation, any recipient may at any time request a good cause exemption from the requirements of this section;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Impose time limitations on educational goals of recipients of assistance under W.S. 42-2-104 who are under twenty (20) years of age and have not obtained a high school diploma or general equivalency degree;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Require that applicants and current recipients cooperate within a period specified by department rules to establish paternity and child support obligations, subject to good cause exceptions established by department rules and regulations. The applicant shall not be eligible for personal opportunities with employment responsibilities benefits and a recipient shall not receive benefits until the applicant or recipient has cooperated as required under this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Provide that the department may waive program requirements, other than time limits which shall be waived under paragraph (i) of this subsection, for individuals who are fleeing for personal safety or for the safety of their children or who have been victimized by domestic violence, or who are at risk of further domestic violence, as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Work participation requirements or state postsecondary education program restrictions may be waived for one (1) year, without re-evaluation, for individuals who have not exhausted their benefits under the federal temporary assistance to needy families block grant. Program requirements under this paragraph may not be waived for longer than:</p>
                  <p>(I) One (1) year, unless the recipient's circumstances are re-evaluated at six (6) month intervals after the first year;</p>
                  <p>(II) Two (2) years, unless the recipient meets the requirements of subdivision (I) of this subparagraph and is cooperating in the development and implementation of a plan with the department and the local domestic violence agency to correct circumstances which have contributed to the domestic violence or the threat of domestic violence.</p>
                  <p>(B) For individuals who have exhausted their benefits under the federal temporary assistance to needy families block grant, program requirements under this paragraph may be waived by the department only if the individual's circumstances are re-evaluated at six (6) month intervals and, after one (1) year, the individual is cooperating in the development and implementation of a plan with the department and the local domestic violence agency to correct circumstances which have contributed to the domestic violence or threat of domestic violence.</p>
                  <p>(f) In administering the child care and development fund provided for in the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, and subject to approval of a state plan amendment by the administration of children and families of the United States department of health and human services, the department shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually by April 1 establish the hourly copayment required to be paid by parents for each eligible child, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) Households with income at or below one hundred percent (100%) of the federal poverty level shall not be required to make a copayment;</p>
                  <p>(B) For households with income above one hundred percent (100%) up to two hundred twenty-five percent (225%) of the federal poverty level, the copayment shall be calculated based on the following table. For each category of income in the first column, the parents' hourly copayment per child shall be determined by multiplying the annual income dollar amount for a family of two (2) that corresponds with the percentage of federal poverty level in the second column by the multiplier in the third column, then dividing by two thousand three hundred forty (2,340), the annual number of hours of child care required by a full-time working parent, and rounding the result to the nearest five cents ($.05):</p>

                  <p>(a) The department may through the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program provide financial assistance for a dependent child and an eligible caretaker. Financial assistance under this program shall be in the form of a performance payment or protective payment payable to or on behalf of an eligible recipient. Any individual not a relative of the dependent child but interested in or concerned with the welfare of the child and his eligible caretaker may subject to qualifications prescribed by rule and regulation of the department, receive a protective payment on behalf of the dependent child which shall not count toward the caretaker's five (5) year limit for benefits under W.S. 42-2-103(e)(i) unless the nonrelative caretaker is included in the calculation of the performance payment of the dependent child.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to any other state or federal regulation and subject to W.S. 42-2-103(e), an assistance unit qualifying under W.S. 42-2-103(a) with a dependent child is eligible for financial assistance under the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program. For purposes of this subsection, a dependent child includes any child who is under eighteen (18) years of age and living with a relative in a residence maintained by the relative as determined by rule and regulation of the department, regularly attending school or its equivalent as determined by the department, or is expected to graduate from high school before the age of nineteen (19) years. For purposes of this subsection, a dependent child does not include a minor parent.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>42-2-402. Transfers of assets affecting eligibility; exceptions; disclosures by applicants.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If an institutionalized individual or the individual's spouse has disposed of, for less than fair market value, any asset or interest therein within sixty (60) months before or any time after the first date the individual has both applied for medical assistance and been institutionalized, the individual is ineligible for medical assistance for long-term care services for the period of time determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) For a transfer within the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the number of months of ineligibility for long- term care services shall be the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred within the sixty (60) month period, divided by the average monthly cost to a private patient for nursing facility services on the date of application. The period of ineligibility begins with the later of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The first day of the first month in which the assets were transferred and which does not occur in any other period of ineligibility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The date on which the individual is eligible for medical assistance under the state plan and would otherwise be receiving institutional level care, but for the application of the penalty period, and which does not occur during any other period of ineligibility under this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the case of a transfer by the spouse of an individual which results in a period of ineligibility for medical assistance under this section for the individual, the department shall, using a reasonable methodology as specified by the secretary of health and human services, apportion the period of ineligibility for any portion of the period, among the individual and the individual's spouse if the spouse otherwise becomes eligible for medical assistance under chapter 4 of this title.</p>
                  <p>(d) An institutionalized individual is not rendered ineligible for long-term care services due to a transfer within the provisions of subsection (a) of this section if the asset transferred was a home and:</p>
                  <p>(i) Title to the home was transferred to the individual's:</p>
                  <p>(A) Spouse;</p>
                  <p>(B) Child who is under age twenty-one (21);</p>
                  <p>(C) Blind or disabled child as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1382c;</p>
                  <p>(D) Sibling who has equity interest in the home and who was residing in the home for a period of at least one (1) year immediately before the date the individual became an institutionalized individual; or</p>
                  <p>(E) Child who was residing in the home for a period of at least two (2) years immediately before the date the individual became an institutionalized individual, and who provided care to the individual which permitted the individual to reside at home rather than in an institution or facility.</p>
                  <p>(e) An institutionalized individual is not rendered ineligible for long-term care services due to a transfer within the provisions of subsection (a) of this section if the department determines:</p>
                  <p>(i) The individual intended to dispose of the asset at fair market value or for other valuable consideration;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The asset was transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medical assistance;</p>
                  <p>(iii) That to the extent assets were transferred for less than fair market value, that the assets or their fair market equivalent have been returned to the individual; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) To grant a waiver of the excess resources created by the uncompensated transfer because denial of eligibility would cause undue hardship for the individual, based on criteria established by the secretary of health and human services.</p>
                  <p>(f) An institutionalized person who has made or whose spouse has made a transfer within the provisions of subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section is not ineligible for long-term care services if the asset was transferred:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the individual's spouse or to another individual for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse;</p>
                  <p>(ii) From the individual's spouse to another individual for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To the individual's child who is blind or disabled, as defined by 42 U.S.C. 1382c, or to a trust established solely for the benefit of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iv) To a trust established solely for the benefit of an individual under sixty-five (65) years of age who is disabled as defined by 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3).</p>
                  <p>(g) An applicant for long-term care services shall disclose any interest the applicant, or the applicant's spouse who is not residing in long-term care, has in an annuity or similar financial instrument, regardless of whether the annuity or instrument is irrevocable or is treated as an asset. For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the purchase of an annuity shall be treated as the disposal of an asset for less than fair market value unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state is named as the remainder beneficiary in the first position for at least the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the annuitant under this article; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The state is named as the remainder beneficiary in the second position after the spouse or minor or disabled child and is named in the first position if the spouse or a representative of the child disposes of any of the remainder for less than fair market value.</p>

                  <p>(a) For purposes of determining an individual's eligibility for or the amount of benefits under chapter 4 of this title, the rules specified in subsections (d) and (e) of this section shall apply to a trust established by the individual.</p>
                  <p>(b) For purposes of this section, a trust shall be considered to have been established if an asset of an individual, other than an asset transferred by will, was used to form all or part of the corpus of the trust by any of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The individual;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The individual's spouse;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A person including a court or administrative body, with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A person including a court or administrative body, acting at the direction or upon the request of the individual or the individual's spouse.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the case of a trust the corpus of which includes assets of any other person, the provisions of this section shall apply to the portion of the trust attributable to the assets of the individual. This section shall apply without regard to:</p>
                  <p>(i) The purposes for which a trust is established;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether the trustees may exercise any discretion under the trust;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any restrictions on when or whether distributions may be made from the trust; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any restrictions on the use of distributions from the trust.</p>
                  <p>(d) In the case of a revocable trust:</p>
                  <p>(i) The corpus of the trust shall be considered resources available to the individual;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Payments from the trust to or for the benefit of the individual shall be considered income of the individual; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any other payments from the trust shall be considered assets disposed of by the individual for purposes of W.S. 42-2-402.</p>
                  <p>(e) In the case of an irrevocable trust:</p>
                  <p>(i) If there are any circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual, the portion of the corpus or corpus income from which payments to the individual could be made shall be considered resources available to the individual, and payments from that portion of the corpus or income to or for the benefit of the individual shall be considered income of the individual. Payments from that portion of the corpus or income for any other purpose shall be considered a transfer of assets by the individual subject to W.S. 42-2-402; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any portion of the trust or corpus income from which no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual shall be considered, as of the date of establishment of the trust or, if later, the date on which payment to the individual was foreclosed, to be assets disposed by the individual for purposes of W.S. 42-2-402. The value of the trust shall be determined for purposes of W.S. 42-2-402 by including the amount of any payments made from such portion of the trust after the date specified in this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, this section shall not apply to any of the following trusts:</p>
                  <p>(i) A trust containing the assets of an individual under age sixty-five (65) who is disabled as defined by 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3) and which is established for the benefit of that individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the individual or a court if the state will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of the individual up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual under chapter 4 of this title;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A trust established for the benefit of an individual if:</p>
                  <p>(A) The trust is composed only of pension, social security and other income to the individual and accumulated income in the trust; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The state will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of the individual up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual under chapter 4 of this title.</p>
                  <p>(iii) A trust containing the assets of an individual who is disabled as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3), that meets the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(A) The trust is established and managed by a nonprofit association;</p>
                  <p>(B) A separate account is maintained for each beneficiary of the trust but, for the purposes of investment and management of funds, the trust pools the accounts;</p>
                  <p>(C) Accounts in the trust are established solely for the benefit of individuals who are disabled as defined by 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3), by the parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the disabled individual, by the disabled individual or by a court; and</p>
                  <p>(D) To the extent that amounts remaining in the beneficiary's account upon the death of the beneficiary are not retained by the trust, the trust pays to the state from the remaining amounts in the account an amount equal to the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary under chapter 4 of this title.</p>
                  <p>(g) The department shall establish procedures in accordance with standards specified by the secretary of health and human services under which the department waives the application of this section for an individual if the individual establishes that application would work an undue hardship on the individual as determined on the basis of criteria established by the secretary.</p>
                  <p>(h) For purposes of this section, "trust" includes any legal instrument or device that is similar to a trust but includes an annuity only to the extent and in the manner as the secretary of health and human resources specifies.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any Wyoming resident may apply for medical assistance under this chapter by filing an application by telephone, by mail, in person at the eligibility customer service center in Cheyenne, on the eligibility internet site or at a department of family services field office located in the county in which the individual resides. A determination of eligibility for medical assistance shall be based upon the application. Medical assistance shall be provided on behalf of a qualified applicant with reasonable promptness.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon signing an application for medical assistance under this chapter, an applicant assigns to the department any right to medical support or payment for medical expenses from any other person on his behalf or on behalf of any relative for whom application is made.

                  <p>(c) In determining the eligibility of an institutionalized spouse for medical assistance under this chapter, the resources of the noninstitutionalized spouse shall not be considered available to the institutionalized spouse to the extent the amount of his resources does not exceed the maximum authorized by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, P.L. 100-360. For purposes of determining the amount of an institutionalized spouse's monthly income to be applied towards payment of institutional care costs, the maximum amount of allowance authorized by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, P.L. 100-360 shall be deducted from his monthly income.</p>
                  <p>(d) In any assistance program under this chapter for which income is the criterion or one (1) of the criteria for assistance payments, compensation received for a veteran's service connected disability shall not be counted in determining income if that compensation on an annual basis is not more than the poverty level for the applicant as determined by the federal office of management and budget.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>42-4-118. Prescription drug assistance program created; eligibility criteria; benefits provided; coverage of medications.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) There is created a prescription drug assistance program to assist residents of the state. The program shall be a state funded program to provide prescription drug assistance, in addition to the services provided under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act. Effective July 1, 2002, the prescription drug assistance program shall replace the minimum medical program. Eligibility for assistance under the program created by this section shall not constitute an entitlement and services shall be provided under this section only to the extent funds are available.</p>
                  <p>(b) Residents of the state may apply for the prescription drug assistance program in the manner provided in W.S. 42-4-106. Upon a determination of eligibility, the applicant remains eligible for assistance under the prescription drug assistance program as provided in this section. If a recipient ceases to be a resident of the state, his eligibility under the program shall terminate. The department shall by rule and regulation establish income eligibility guidelines no later than July 1 of each year based on the federal poverty levels in effect on January 1 of that calendar year. Persons with family income of one hundred percent (100%) of the federal poverty level or less shall be eligible under this section. The rules shall take into consideration family size up to four (4) individuals. Eligibility for families consisting of more than four (4) individuals shall be determined on the basis of the income of a family of four (4) individuals. Persons eligible for prescription drug assistance under other state or federal programs, except the state high risk health insurance pool, shall be ineligible for assistance under the prescription drug assistance program.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided by this subsection, an eligibility determination made under subsection (b) of this section shall be valid for one (1) year. A recipient whose monthly income changes by more than one-third (1/3), shall report the change in income to the department.

                  <p>(i) The individual is a beneficiary under the federal Medicare program who has not been determined to be eligible for full Medicaid benefits under the state plan;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The total family income of the individual does not exceed one hundred seventy-five percent (175%) of the federal poverty level in effect on April 1 of that calendar year;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>42-4-121. Program of all-inclusive care for the elderly.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The department, as an optional services program of the Medicaid program, may develop and implement a program of all- inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) in accordance with section 4802 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, P.L. 105-33, as amended, and 42 C.F.R. part 460.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department may contract with approved PACE organizations to provide, in the manner and to the extent authorized by federal law, comprehensive, community based acute and long term care services for older Medicaid eligible participants who are at least fifty-five (55) years old, living in a PACE service area, certified by the department as eligible for long term care facility placement and who elect to participate in the PACE program. Services provided through a PACE organization shall include all necessary medical and related care required by the PACE participant, including but not limited to physician and other health care provider visits, regular check ups, prescription drugs, rehabilitation services, home and personal care services, medically necessary transportation, hospitalization and skilled nursing facility services.</p>
                  <p>(c) The objective of the PACE program is to provide prepaid, capitated, quality comprehensive health care services that are designed to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Enhance the quality of life and autonomy for frail, older adults;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Maximize dignity of, and respect for, older adults;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Enable frail, older adults to live in the community as long as medically and socially feasible;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Preserve and support the older adult's family unit.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this section. In adopting rules, the department shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide application procedures for organizations seeking to become a PACE program provider;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Establish the capitation rate for Medicaid participants electing to participate in the PACE program instead of receiving Medicaid services on a fee for service basis. The capitation rate shall be no less than ninety percent (90%) of the fee for service equivalent cost, including the department's cost of administration, that the department estimates would be payable for all services covered under the PACE organization contract if all of those services were to be provided on a fee for service basis;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide application procedures, including acknowledgment of informed consent, for Medicaid participants electing to participate in the PACE program in lieu of receiving fee for service Medicaid benefits.</p>
                  <p>(e) PACE provider organizations shall be public or private organizations providing or having the capacity to provide, as determined by the department, comprehensive health care services on a risk based capitated basis to PACE patients.</p>
                  <p>(f) To demonstrate capacity as required by subsection (e) of this section, the department shall consider evidence such as an organization's insurance, reinsurance, cash reserves, letters of credit, guarantees of companies affiliated with the organization or a combination of those arrangements.</p>
                  <p>(g) PACE organizations shall assume responsibility for all costs generated by PACE program participants, and shall create and maintain a risk reserve fund that will cover any cost overages for any participant. A PACE organization is responsible for the full financial risk that the cost of services required by a program participant might exceed the Medicaid capitated fee for that participant.</p>
                  <p>(h) The department shall develop and implement a coordinated plan to promote the PACE program among prospective Medicaid long term care patients in the service areas of approved PACE organizations.</p>
                  <p>(j) As soon as practicable after July 1, 2010, the department shall submit to the federal centers for Medicare and Medicaid services an amendment to the state Medicaid plan authorizing the state to implement the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly pursuant to this section. The department shall not enter into a contract with any PACE provider organization until all necessary state plan amendments or waivers are approved. An additional amendment to the state Medicaid plan shall not be required each time the department enters into a contract with a new PACE provider organization.</p>
                  <p>(k) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a PACE organization to hold a certificate of authority as an insurer or a health maintenance organization under title 26 of the Wyoming statutes.</p>
                  <p>(m) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 59, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(n) No PACE organization shall withhold any necessary medical or nonmedical services to any PACE participant in order to increase the organization's profit from the Medicaid capitated payment.</p>
                  <p>(o) PACE participants may disenroll from the PACE program at any time. A PACE organization shall promptly report the identity of all disenrolled participants to the department.</p>

                  <p>(a) With the consent of the governor, the department shall apply, in the form of any necessary federal waiver, state plan amendment or other agreement, to the United States department of health and human services and endeavor to make coverage of air ambulance transport services through Medicaid available to all Wyoming residents, except that coverage may be limited to specified groups of Wyoming residents as necessary to obtain approval.</p>
                  <p>(b) Contingent on federal approval under subsection (a) of this section, there is created the air ambulance transport services program under the department. Operation of the air ambulance services program as provided in subsections (c) through (p) of this section shall be contingent on the federal approval required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Coverage for air ambulance transport services under this section shall be provided through retroactive eligibility. A Wyoming resident or air ambulance provider may make a claim for payment of air ambulance transport services to the department. A claim shall be submitted within ninety (90) days of air ambulance transport services occurring, except for good cause as determined by the department. An air ambulance provider shall provide services under this section if the provider otherwise makes air ambulance transport services available to persons in Wyoming who are eligible for Medicaid independent of the coverage provided by this section. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, an air ambulance provider who provides services under this section shall accept payment under this subsection as full satisfaction of all charges, costs and fees relating to air ambulance transport services.</p>
                  <p>(d) An air ambulance provider shall collect a copay or other cost sharing requirement for services covered under this section, as established by the department and consistent with federal requirements, based on the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) For persons who are eligible for Medicaid independent of the coverage provided by this section, any copay or other cost sharing requirement shall be consistent with the copay or cost sharing requirement specified for other services under Medicaid;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For persons who are not eligible for Medicaid independent of the coverage provided by this section, any copay or cost sharing requirement shall be proportionate, based on income and shall not be greater than fifty percent (50%) of the allowable costs for air ambulance transport under this section, as determined by the department.</p>
                  <p>(e) All premium assessments and reimbursements received under this section shall be deposited into the air ambulance coverage account and shall be used by the department to pay air ambulance transport claims covered under this section, as well as to administer this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) Consistent with subsection (a) of this section, all air ambulance transport services otherwise provided or covered by any program administered by the state of Wyoming, including, but not limited to, the State Employees and Officials Group Insurance Act and the Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act, shall be covered under this section. Other than paying reimbursements under this section, state agencies shall not have a duty to provide or cover air ambulance transport services after the department begins providing services under this section, except for persons otherwise not covered pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) To facilitate coverage under this section, the department of workforce services, the department of administration and information and other state agencies that are otherwise responsible for coverage of air ambulance transport services shall pay reimbursement for these services to the air ambulance coverage account, in the manner prescribed by the department of health after consultation with the relevant state agency. As a component of reimbursement under this section, the department of health shall require a state agency to pay, on a proportional basis, administrative costs necessary to implement this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) The department may enter into agreements with the following persons for the purposes of this section:</p>

                  <p>(ii) Persons who provide dispatch for air ambulance transport services;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A third party administrator;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any other person or entity necessary to implement this section, except as otherwise provided by subsection (j) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(j) The insurance commissioner may enter into agreements with employee welfare benefit plans, as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002, and other health insurance plans operating in this state not subject to state regulation, in order to make air ambulance transport coverage available under this section to insured persons covered by those plans. If a plan enters into an agreement under this paragraph, the plan shall pay an assessment on net premiums and net considerations in this state to the insurance commissioner as otherwise provided in W.S. 26-4-103(n) but shall not be required to file a report under W.S. 26-4- 103(a).</p>
                  <p>(k) There is created the air ambulance coverage account. Premium assessments collected by the insurance commissioner and state agency reimbursements paid to the department of health under this section shall be deposited into the account and used by the department to cover air ambulance transport services under this section and to implement this section. Other funds used to provide air ambulance coverage, including federal funds, may be deposited into the account. The account may be divided into subaccounts for purposes of administrative management. Funds in the account and any amounts earned from those funds are continuously appropriated and shall not lapse at the end of any fiscal period. For accounting and investing only, subaccounts shall be treated as separate accounts.</p>
                  <p>(m) The rules of the department governing administrative hearings under Medicaid shall apply to any action of the department under this section. The department may, if appropriate, establish a managed care program under this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a person who is or becomes an applicant or recipient for medical assistance under this chapter receives an injury under circumstances creating a legal liability in some third party, the applicant or recipient shall not be deprived of any medical assistance for which he is entitled under this chapter. He may also pursue his remedy at law against the third party.

In addition the person paying the settlement remains liable to the state's reimbursement right unless the state through the attorney general signs the release prior to payment of an agreed settlement.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the injury causes death of the recipient, the rights and remedies in this section inure to, and the obligations are binding upon the personal representative of the deceased recipient for the benefit of his dependents.</p>

                  <p>(a) When the department provides, pays for or becomes liable for medical care, it shall have a lien for the cost of the medical assistance provided upon any and all causes of action which accrue to the person to whom the care was furnished, or to the person's legal representatives, as a result of the injuries which necessitated the medical care.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department may perfect and enforce its lien by following the procedures set forth in W.S. 29-1-312 and 29-1-313, and its verified lien statement shall be filed with the appropriate clerk in the county of financial responsibility. The verified lien statement shall contain the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and address of the person to whom medical care was furnished;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The date of injury;</p>

                  <p>(i) Applicants for medical assistance shall notify the state or local agency of any possible claims when they submit the application. Recipients of medical assistance shall notify the department of any possible claims when those claims arise. A recipient's noncooperation in providing information to the department to assist in pursuing liable third parties shall result in denial or termination of eligibility per federal law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An enrolled medicaid provider shall notify the department when the person has reason to believe that a third party may be liable for payment of the cost of medical care. If the person providing medical care services fails to notify the department when a third party is liable for payment of the cost of medical care and the department, because of lack of notice from the provider, does not receive reimbursement for the cost of medical care, the department may adjust the value of those claims from future payments to that provider;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An attorney representing an applicant for or a recipient of medical assistance in a claim upon which the department may have a reimbursement right under this chapter shall notify the department of its potential claim for reimbursement before filing a claim, commencing an action, or negotiating a settlement. Any attorney who fails to notify the department of any settlement or fails to ensure the state is reimbursed, to the extent of its reimbursement right, from the proceeds of any settlement or judgment under this section shall be reported to the state board of professional responsibility for the Wyoming state bar. If the attorney knowingly failed to report and insure reimbursement to the state, the department shall have a claim for relief against the attorney for the amount of the reimbursement right under this chapter;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Insurers shall not disburse any settlement payment for a personal injury claim made to a recipient of medical assistance under this act until seven (7) working days after the department has received written notice from the insurer of the proposed settlement or judgment and failed to provide a written objection to the insurer. Failure to provide notice under this paragraph shall commence the tolling of any applicable statute of limitations.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notice given to the local agency is not sufficient to meet the requirements of paragraphs (d)(ii) through (iv) of this section.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>42-4-204. Department subrogated to right of recovery of applicant or recipient; utilization of personal health insurance; insurance coverage of recipients.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The department shall be subrogated to any right of recovery or indemnification arising from an accident or occurrence resulting in expenditures by the department, which an applicant or recipient of medical assistance or any legally liable party has against an insurer, health insurer, self- insured plan, group health plan, service benefit plan, managed care organization, pharmacy benefit manager or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for health care items or services, including but not limited to hospitalization, pharmaceutical services, physician services, nursing services and other medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department for the care and treatment of the applicant or recipient. An applicant or recipient or legally liable party, by the act of applying for, or recipient receiving medical assistance, shall be deemed to have made a subrogation assignment and an assignment of claim for benefits to the department. The department shall inform an applicant of the assignments at the time of application. In addition, any entitlements from a contractual agreement with an applicant or recipient or legally liable party, a state or federal program or a claim or action against any responsible third party for medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department, shall be so assigned. The entitlements shall be directly reimbursable to the department by third party payors. The department may assign its right to subrogation or its entitlement to benefits to a designee or a health care provider participating in the medicaid program and providing services to an applicant or recipient, in order to assist the provider in obtaining payment for the services. A provider that has received an assignment from the department shall notify the insurer of the assignment upon rendering of services to the applicant or recipient. Failure to so notify the insurer shall render the provider ineligible for payment from the department. Once the insurer has been billed or notified the provider may not request payment through the medicaid program until a payment, denial or other explanation of benefits, not including mistakes in billing, is received from the insurer. The provider shall notify the department of any request by the applicant or recipient or his legally liable party or representative for billing information.</p>
                  <p>(b) When a recipient of medical assistance has access to personal health insurance through his employer, payment or part payment of the premium for the insurance may be made by the department when deemed appropriate by the director of the department.</p>
                  <p>(c) No individual accident policy, group accident policy, health policy, accident and health policy, medical expense policy or medical service plan contract, delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this state on or after July 1, 1995, and no self-insured plan, managed care policy or plan, pharmacy benefit management plan or policy or other policy or plan issued by any other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement legally responsible for payment of a claim for items or services, delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this state on or after July 1, 2007, shall contain any provision denying or limiting insurance benefits because services are rendered to an insured who is eligible for or who received medical assistance under this chapter. This section shall supersede any statutory provision to the contrary. No such policy, plan or contract, when enrolling an individual, shall take into account the individual's eligibility for medical assistance under this chapter. This subsection applies to all such policies, plans and contracts issued by any person including, but not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(i) An insurer;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A group health plan as defined in section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A managed care organization, pharmacy benefit manager or other party that is, by statute, contract or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service;</p>
                  <p>(iv) An entity offering a service benefit plan;</p>
                  <p>(v) A self-insured plan.</p>
                  <p>(d) Medicaid shall not pay for any services provided under this chapter if the individual eligible for medical assistance has coverage for the services under an accident or health insurance policy or other source.</p>
                  <p>(e) In addition to the separate requirements set forth in W.S. 42-4-205, all health insurers, including all self-insured plans, group health plans as defined in section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, service benefit plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, or other parties that are, by statute, contract, or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, shall agree, as a condition of doing business in the state of Wyoming, to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide, with respect to the individuals who are eligible for or are provided medical assistance by the department of health, information to determine the period during which the individual or the individuals' spouses or dependents may be or may have been covered by a health insurer and the nature of the coverage provided, including the name and address of the insurer and identifying number of the plan, in a manner prescribed by the secretary;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Accept the state's right of recovery and the assignment to the state of any right of an individual or other entity to payment from another party for an item or service for which payment has been made under the state plan;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Respond to any inquiry by the state regarding a claim for payment for any health care item or service that is submitted not later than three (3) years after the date of the provision of such health care item or service; and</p>

                  <p>(A) The claim is submitted by the state within the three (3) year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Any action by the state to enforce its rights with respect to the claim is commenced within six (6) years of the state's submission of the claim.</p>

                  <p>(a) If an individual receives any medical assistance pursuant to this chapter, upon the individual's death, if single, or upon the death of the survivor of a married couple, either of whom received medical assistance, the total amount paid for medical assistance rendered for the individual or the spouse shall be filed by the department of health as a claim against the estate of the individual or the estate of the surviving spouse in the court having jurisdiction to probate the estate.

                  <p>(i) The person was fifty-five (55) years of age or older when he received medical assistance; or</p>

                  <p>(b) The claim shall be considered an expense of the last illness of the decedent.

                  <p>(a) The department may through appropriate action recover any incorrect payment of medical assistance under this chapter on behalf of a recipient and may adjust any subsequent payment by an amount equal to the incorrect payment. Any recovery shall be prorated to the federal government in proportion to the amount it contributed for medical assistance rendered.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to subsection (a) of this section and subject to a court order for recovery, the department may file a lien upon all real and personal property of the recipient for the incorrect payment of medical assistance on his behalf.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department may file a pre-death lien upon real property of an individual for medical assistance correctly paid under this chapter to an individual:</p>
                  <p>(i) Who is an inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for people with intellectual disability, or other medical institution; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) With respect to whom the department determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged from the medical institution and to return home.</p>
                  <p>(d) No lien may be imposed under subsection (c) of this section on an individual's home if any of the following persons are lawfully residing in the home:</p>
                  <p>(i) The spouse of the individual;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The individual's child who is under age twenty-one (21), or is blind or disabled as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1382c; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) A sibling of the individual, who has an equity interest in the home and who was residing in the home for a period of at least one (1) year immediately before the date of the individual's admission to the medical institution.</p>
                  <p>(e) No lien imposed under subsection (c) of this section shall be subject to recovery if any of the following persons are lawfully residing in the home on a continuous basis since the date of the individual's admission to the facility or institution:</p>
                  <p>(i) A sibling of the individual who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least one (1) year immediately before the date of the individual's admission to the facility or institution;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A child of the individual who was residing in the individual's home for a period of at least two (2) years immediately before the date of the individual's admission to the facility or institution, and who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he provided care to the individual which permitted the individual to reside at home rather than in a facility or institution.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any lien imposed with respect to an individual pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall dissolve upon that individual's discharge from the medical institution and return home.</p>
                  <p>(g) Nothing in this section shall require an applicant for medical assistance under this chapter to enter into agreement for a lien upon his real and personal property for the payment of medical assistance on his behalf.</p>
                  <p>(h) Upon sale of the property on which a lien has been imposed pursuant to subsection (c) or (j) of this section, the department shall seek recovery of the amount stated in its lien. Transfers of real or personal property on or after the look-back dates defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1396p by recipients of medical assistance under this chapter, or their spouses, without adequate consideration are voidable and may be set aside by an action in district court.</p>
                  <p>(j) The department may file a lien against the property of any estate, as defined in W.S. 42-4-206(g), of a deceased recipient for the amount of medical assistance provided while the recipient was fifty-five (55) years of age or older or while the recipient was an inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for people with intellectual disability or other medical institution. The department shall perfect this lien by filing a notice in the county in which the real property exists. The department may file an amended lien prior to the entry of the final order closing the estate.</p>
                  <p>(k) The department may file a lien upon real property pursuant to W.S. 2-18-103(g) upon the death of the grantor. The department may file such lien regardless of whether the grantee applied for a certificate of clearance pursuant to W.S. 2-18-103(n) or filed an affidavit to establish the death of the grantor pursuant to W.S. 34-11-101.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>42-6-104. Alternative long term care home pilot programs authorized.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Three (3) pilot program grants are authorized to study the feasibility of innovation in long term care facilities. Eligible recipients shall include cities, counties and any entity planning for long term care needs or providing long term care including private nonprofit and private for profit entities. The department shall solicit proposals for the grants through a request for proposals developed in consultation with the advisory council on aging. The department, in consultation with the council, shall select the recipients from the proposals received. The department shall negotiate any specific provisions of the grant award needed and shall administer the grants. In selecting the recipients, the council shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Consider the extent to which the proposal moves the staff of the facility to a more patient centered culture;</p>
                <p>(ii) Consider one (1) project to reconfigure an existing nursing home to achieve a resident-centered cultural change;</p>
                <p>(iii) Fund one (1) study relating to the creation of an alternative eldercare home, as defined in W.S. 42-6-102(a)(iii), provided that an acceptable project proposal is received in response to the request for proposals;</p>
                <p>(iv) Fund one (1) study relating to the creation of an alternative eldercare home, as defined in W.S. 42-6-102(a)(iii), which shall require that the home:</p>
                <p>(A) Maintains residences as units independent from other facilities such that there is no physical connection or shared roof structures between houses;</p>
                <p>(B) Provides a secured exterior patio or garden with covered seating for each house accessible by all residents including those with wheelchairs and assistive devices;</p>
                <p>(C) Provides for locked storage of hazardous materials and control of kitchen access during high traffic periods of meal preparation and clean-up;</p>
                <p>(D) Provides a den in each house to accommodate television viewing and limited overnight guests;</p>
                <p>(E) Implements a self-managed work team approach to in-house and clinical support staffing. Each house shall have its own core in-house staffing that is specific and dedicated to a single house;</p>
                <p>(F) Uses a home base facility for the clinical support team members that is outside and separate from the house; and</p>
                <p>(G) Maintains a lift free environment by providing ceiling lifts in each resident's bedroom and bathroom.</p>
                <p>(v) Consider the extent to which there is a market for the proposed facility or the extent to which people in need of long term care are likely to choose the proposed facility; and</p>
                <p>(vi) Consider the extent to which the proposed pilot project will determine the effectiveness of its approach to elder care in a timely manner.</p>
                <p>(b) Each grant proposal shall include plans for a local or applicant match of twenty-five percent (25%) of the grant amount.</p>
                <p>(c) For applicants that have completed any appropriate needs study or market study, the grant funding may be used for design and development of the facility and the organization which will operate it. If this is done, the grant recipient shall agree to accept Medicaid clients in the facility without discrimination.</p>
                <p>(d) The department is directed to work with grant recipients in the development of rules and regulations which are compatible with the culture of the homes and which will assure appropriate licensure for the care provided and the needs of the elder residents. The department shall inform the joint labor, health and social services interim committee if legislation is needed to authorize any necessary rules and regulations.</p>
                <p>(e) As a condition of receiving the grants, each grantee shall agree to provide training and reports to other parties in the state interested in innovative long term care approaches.</p>

                <p>(i) Before January 1, 2010, or as soon thereafter as possible, make application to the federal department of health and human services for a state plan amendment to establish that, if an individual is a beneficiary of a long-term care partnership program certified policy, the total assets an individual owns and may retain under Medicaid and still qualify for benefits under Medicaid at the time the individual applies for long-term care benefits are increased by one dollar ($1.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) of benefit paid out under the individual's long-term care partnership program certified insurance policy;</p>
                <p>(ii) Provide information and technical assistance to the department on the department's role in assuring that any individual who sells a qualified long-term care insurance partnership policy receives training and demonstrates evidence of an understanding of such policies and how they relate to other public and private coverage of long-term care.</p>
                <p>(c) The department may not impose any requirement affecting the terms of benefits of a policy under the partnership program unless the department imposes such requirement on long-term care insurance policies without regard to whether the policy is covered under the partnership or is offered in connection with such a partnership.</p>

                <p>(i) Any individual who has purchased a partnership policy in any participating state, who has received benefits under the policy and who applies for Medicaid in a participating state other than the one in which the policy was issued shall receive an asset disregard in an equal dollar amount to the benefits received under the policy;</p>
                <p>(ii) The asset disregard procedure and calculation shall be the same for every individual with a partnership policy who applies for Medicaid in the participating state, without regard to whether the policy was purchased in another state or the date the policy was purchased;</p>

                <p>(iv) If a person moves from the state in which the person's partnership policy was issued, later applies for Medicaid in another participating state and is determined to be eligible using a partnership asset disregard, the partnership asset disregard shall not be revoked upon eligibility redetermination should the state subsequently decide to become exempt from the reciprocity agreement.</p>

                <p>(a) The nursing care facility assessment account is created.</p>
                <p>(b) The state treasurer shall invest amounts deposited within the account in accordance with law, and all investment earnings shall be credited back to the account.</p>
                <p>(c) The account shall consist of:</p>
                <p>(i) Amounts collected or received by the department from nursing care facility assessments under this article;</p>
                <p>(ii) All federal matching funds received by the department as a result of expenditures made by the department attributable to the account;</p>
                <p>(iii) Any interest or penalties levied in conjunction with the administration of this article.</p>
                <p>(d) The account is created for the purpose of receiving funds as specified in this section. Collected assessment funds shall be used to secure federal matching funds available through the state Medicaid plan, which shall be used to make Medicaid payments for nursing care facility services which exceed the amount of nursing care facility Medicaid rates, in the aggregate, as calculated in accordance with the approved state Medicaid plan in effect on October 1, 2010. The fund shall be used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
                <p>(i) To pay administrative expenses incurred by the department or its agent in performing the activities authorized by this article, provided that such expenses shall not exceed a total of one percent (1%) of the aggregate assessment funds collected in the fiscal year;</p>
                <p>(ii) To increase nursing care facility payments to fund covered services to Medicaid beneficiaries within Medicare upper payment limits, as negotiated with the department. The upper payment limit for private nursing care facilities, state government-owned facilities and nonstate government-owned nursing facilities shall be calculated by the department using the higher of the cost-based or prospective payment system approach in accordance with the provisions of 42 C.F.R. 447.272;</p>
                <p>(iii) To repay the federal government any excess payments made to nursing facilities if the state plan, after approval by the federal centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, is subsequently disapproved for any reason and after the state has appealed. Nursing care facilities shall refund the excess payments to the assessment account. The department shall return the excess payments to the federal government and nursing care facility providers in the same proportion as the original financing. Individual nursing care facilities shall be reimbursed based on the proportion of the individual nursing care facility's assessment to the total assessment paid by nursing care facilities. If a nursing care facility is unable to refund payments as provided in this paragraph, the department shall develop a payment plan and deduct amounts from future Medicaid payments. The department shall refund the federal government for the federal portion of those overpayments; or</p>
                <p>(iv) To make quarterly adjustment payments as provided in W.S. 42-8-108.</p>

                <p>(b) The assessment due under this section shall be imposed each fiscal year in an amount calculated as a uniform percentage of each hospital's net patient revenue.

                <p>(d) If a private hospital ceases to operate as a hospital or for any reason ceases to be subject to the assessment imposed under this chapter, the assessment for the fiscal year in which the cessation occurs shall be adjusted by multiplying the annual assessment by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the year during which the hospital is subject to the assessment and the denominator of which is three hundred sixty-five (365). Immediately upon ceasing to operate as a hospital, or otherwise ceasing to be subject to this chapter, the hospital shall pay the assessment for each quarter as adjusted, to the extent not previously paid.</p>
