                  <p>(a) The meaning and effect of the terms of a trust are determined by:</p>
                  <p>(i) The law of the jurisdiction designated in the terms of the trust; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the absence of a controlling designation in the terms of the trust, the law of the jurisdiction having the most significant relationship to the matter at issue. In determining the most significant relationship, the principal place of administration as defined in W.S. 4-10-108 shall be the most heavily weighted factor and the location of trust property shall be the second most significant factor. The least significant factors shall be where the beneficiaries or settlor are domiciled.</p>
                  <p>(b) The law of the jurisdiction designated in the terms of the trust may be changed to the principal place of administration by a court with subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the law of this state governs the meaning and effect of the terms of a trust in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) or subsection (b) of this section, the trust and any transfer of property by a settlor to the trust, or any disposition made subject to the terms of the trust, shall not be void, voidable, set aside or deemed defective in any manner for any reason including:</p>
                  <p>(i) That the law of a foreign jurisdiction prohibits or does not recognize the concept of a trust; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) That the trust, transfer of property by a settlor to the trust, or disposition made subject to the terms of the trust avoids or defeats any forced heirship or legitime right, claim or interest under the law of a foreign jurisdiction.</p>

                  <p>(c) Without precluding the right of the court to order, approve or disapprove a transfer, the trustee, in furtherance of the duty prescribed by subsection (b) of this section, may transfer the trust's principal place of administration to another state or to a jurisdiction outside of the United States.</p>
                  <p>(d) The trustee shall notify the qualified beneficiaries in writing of a proposed transfer of a trust's principal place of administration to another jurisdiction not less than sixty (60) days before initiating the transfer, unless waived by written consent of all qualified beneficiaries.

                  <p>(a) If upon petition the court finds that the settlor and all qualified beneficiaries consent to the modification or termination of a noncharitable irrevocable trust, the court may enter an order approving the modification or termination, even if the modification or termination is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. A settlor's power to consent to a modification or termination of a trust may be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney only to the extent expressly authorized by the power of attorney or the terms of the trust or, if no agent is so authorized, then by the settlor's conservator or guardian. Exercise of the settlor's power to consent by an agent, conservator or guardian shall be in each case with the approval of the court upon a finding by the court that such action is not inconsistent with the settlor's purpose or intent.</p>
                  <p>(b) A noncharitable irrevocable trust may be modified or terminated by a trust protector provided that the terms of the trust authorize a protector and grant the trust protector the power to modify or terminate the trust.</p>
                  <p>(c) A noncharitable irrevocable trust may be terminated upon consent of all of the beneficiaries if the court concludes that continuance of the trust is not necessary to achieve any material purpose of the trust.

                  <p>(b) When the terms of the trust provide that the trustee may only make discretionary distributions to a beneficiary, whether or not the trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor or assignee of the trust beneficiary, including a creditor bringing a claim for forced heirship or legitime, may not compel the trustee to distribute any income or principal, or both, from the trust or reach or attach the interest of the beneficiary unless and until a trust distribution is received by the beneficiary, even if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The trustee has discretion to make distributions for purposes stated in a standard of distribution;</p>

If a trust has more than one (1) settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may attach shall not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.</p>

                  <p>(ii) At least one (1) trustee of the irrevocable trust is a qualified trustee; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The trustee with authority to make distributions to the settlor is not a trust beneficiary, related to the settlor or subordinate to the settlor under Internal Revenue Code section 672(c).</p>
                  <p>(d) After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor's right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the portion of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death, and the property subject thereto, is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors, costs of administration of the settlor's estate, the expenses of the settlor's funeral and disposal of remains to the extent the settlor's probate estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims, costs of administration and expenses.</p>
                  <p>(e) For purposes of this section, the holder of an unexercised power of withdrawal or power of appointment over trust property shall not be treated as a settlor of the trust regardless of whether the power remains exercisable or has lapsed.</p>

                  <p>(a) In this section, "mandatory distribution" means a distribution of income or principal which the trustee is required to make to a beneficiary under the terms of the trust, including a distribution on termination of the trust. The term does not include a discretionary distribution under W.S. 4-10-504.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the trust includes a spendthrift provision, a creditor or assignee of a beneficiary may not compel a mandatory distribution or attach a mandatory distribution until it is received by the beneficiary.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a trust providing for a mandatory distribution does not include a spendthrift provision, a creditor or assignee of a beneficiary may compel the trustee to make the mandatory distribution to the beneficiary where the distribution was not made within a reasonable time.</p>

                  <p>(O) The transferor's potential or actual receipt of income or principal to pay, in whole or in part, income taxes due on income of the trust if the potential or actual receipt of income or principal is pursuant to a provision in the trust instrument that expressly provides for the payment of the taxes and if the potential or actual receipt of income or principal would be the result of a qualified trustee's acting:</p>
                  <p>(I) In the qualified trustee's discretion or pursuant to a mandatory direction in the trust instrument; or</p>
                  <p>(II) At the direction of an advisor described in subparagraph (F) of this paragraph and who is acting in the advisor's discretion.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a creditor or assignee of a settlor of a qualified spendthrift trust, or an agent of a creditor or settlor, has only those rights with respect to the qualified trust property as are provided in W.S. 4-10-514 through 4-10-523 and no creditor, assignee or agent may have any claim or cause of action against the trustee, trust protector, trust advisor or other fiduciary of the trust, or against any person involved in the counseling, drafting, administration, preparation, execution or funding of the trust unless the creditor, assignee or agent can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer of property to the trust was a fraudulent transfer pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act. In the absence of clear and convincing proof, the property transferred is not subject to the claims of the creditor, assignee or agent. Proof by one (1) creditor, assignee or agent that a transfer of property to a qualified spendthrift trust was fraudulent or wrongful does not constitute proof as to any other creditor, assignee or agent and proof of a fraudulent or wrongful transfer of property as to one (1) creditor, assignee or agent shall not invalidate any other qualified transfer of property.</p>

                  <p>(a) A qualified transfer to a qualified spendthrift trust is avoided only to the extent necessary to satisfy the settlor's debt to the creditor at whose instance the qualified transfer had been avoided, together with costs, including attorney's fees if otherwise authorized, as the court may allow. If any qualified transfer is avoided as provided in this section, then:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the court is satisfied that a qualified trustee has not acted in bad faith in accepting or administering the property that is the subject of the qualified transfer:</p>
                  <p>(A) The qualified trustee has a first and paramount lien against the property that is the subject of the qualified transfer in an amount equal to the entire cost, including attorney's fees, court costs, penalties, fines, fees and other amounts paid or payable, which were properly incurred by the qualified trustee in the defense of the action or proceedings to avoid the qualified transfer. It shall be presumed that the qualified trustee did not act in bad faith merely by accepting the property; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The qualified transfer is avoided subject to the proper fees, costs, preexisting rights, claims and interests of the qualified trustee, and of any predecessor trustee that has not acted in bad faith.</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the court is satisfied that a beneficiary of a qualified spendthrift trust has not acted in bad faith, the avoidance of the qualified transfer is subject to the right of the beneficiary to retain any distribution made upon the exercise of a trust power or discretion vested in the qualified trustee of the trust, which power or discretion was properly exercised prior to the creditor's commencement of an action to avoid the qualified transfer. It shall be presumed that the beneficiary, including a beneficiary who is also a settlor of a qualified spendthrift trust, did not act in bad faith merely by creating the trust or by accepting a distribution made in accordance with the terms of the trust.</p>
                  <p>(b) A creditor shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that a trustee or beneficiary of a qualified spendthrift trust acted in bad faith under paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p>

                  <p>If, in any action brought against a trustee of a qualified spendthrift trust, a court takes any action whereby the court declines to apply the law of this state in determining the validity, construction or administration of the trust, or the effect of a spendthrift provision thereof, the trustee may immediately resign without the further order of any court, and cease in all respects to be trustee of the trust. In the event that the trustee does resign and no provision for a successor trustee exists in the trust instrument, the qualified beneficiaries may then petition a Wyoming district court with appropriate jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee who shall succeed as trustee upon such terms and conditions as the district court determines to be consistent with the purposes of the trust and this act. Upon the trustee's ceasing to be trustee, the trustee shall have no power or authority other than to convey the trust property to the successor trustee named in the trust instrument or appointed by the district court.</p>

                  <p>(a) Unless the terms of a trust expressly provide that the trust is irrevocable, the settlor may revoke or amend the trust.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a revocable trust is created or funded by more than one (1) settlor:</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to the rights of persons dealing with a fiduciary as provided in W.S. 4-10-1013, a person may commence a judicial proceeding to contest the validity of a trust that is revocable during the settlor's life or an amendment thereto within the earlier of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Two (2) years after the settlor's death; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) One hundred twenty (120) days after the trustee sent the person a copy of the trust instrument and a notice informing the person of the trust's existence, of the trustee's name and address and of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(b) No trustee shall have any liability under the governing instrument or to any third party or otherwise for failure to provide written notice pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, notice shall have been given when received by the person to whom the notice was given. Absent evidence to the contrary, it shall be presumed that delivery to the last known address of that person constitutes receipt by that person.</p>
                  <p>(d) A person failing to commence a judicial proceeding to contest the validity of a trust within the times provided in this section is forever prohibited from commencing any judicial proceeding contesting the validity of the trust.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable during the settlor's life, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust. The trustee is not subject to liability for doing so unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The trustee knows of a pending judicial proceeding contesting the validity of the trust; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) A potential contestant has notified the trustee in writing of a possible judicial proceeding to contest the trust and a judicial proceeding is commenced within sixty (60) days after the contestant sent the notification.</p>
                  <p>(f) A beneficiary of a trust that is determined to have been invalid is liable to return any distribution received.</p>

                  <p>(iv) There has been a substantial change of circumstances, or removal is requested by all of the qualified beneficiaries, and the court finds that removal of the trustee best serves the interests of all of the beneficiaries and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust, and a suitable cotrustee or successor trustee is available.</p>
                  <p>(c) Pending a final decision on a request to remove a trustee, or in lieu of or in addition to removing a trustee, the court may order such appropriate relief under W.S. 4-10-1001(b) as may be necessary to protect the trust property or the interests of the beneficiaries.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the terms of a trust do not specify the trustee's compensation, a trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. The trustee shall notify the qualified beneficiaries, in writing, of any change in the method or rate of the trustee's compensation. Notice shall be given not less than sixty (60) days in advance of any change, unless the notice is waived by the written consent of all qualified beneficiaries. The notice of a proposed change in the method or rate of trustee's compensation shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) The current trustee's compensation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The proposed change to the trustee's compensation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An explanation of the reasons for the change in compensation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The date upon which the change in compensation is to take effect; and</p>
                  <p>(v) The date, not less than sixty (60) days after giving notice, by which a qualified beneficiary is required to notify the trustee in writing of an objection to the change in compensation.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the terms of a trust specify the trustee's compensation, the trustee is entitled to be compensated as specified, but the court may allow more or less compensation if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The duties of the trustee are substantially different from those contemplated when the trust was created; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The compensation specified by the terms of the trust would be unreasonably low or high.</p>
                  <p>(c) The trustee shall be entitled to additional compensation on agreement of all qualified beneficiaries.</p>
                  <p>(d) The authority of a trustee under this section to change the trustee's rate or method of compensation terminates if a majority of the qualified beneficiaries notify the trustee of objections to the proposed change in compensation on or before the date specified in the notice.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Expenses that were properly incurred in responding to an objection to a proposed change in the method or rate of the trustee's compensation; and</p>

                  <p>(b) Where one (1) or more persons are given authority by a trust instrument or court order to either appoint a trust protector or to direct, consent to or disapprove a fiduciary's actual or proposed distribution decisions or other noninvestment decisions of the fiduciary, the persons or the persons appointed by them shall be considered to be trust protectors under W.S. 4-10-103(a)(xxiii).</p>
                  <p>(c) Where one (1) or more persons are given authority by a trust instrument or court order to either appoint a trust advisor or to direct, consent to or disapprove a fiduciary's actual or proposed investment decisions, the persons or the persons appointed by them shall be considered to be trust advisors under W.S. 4-10-103(a)(xxii).</p>

If the written designation is furnished to the fiduciary and the fiduciary acts in accordance with the direction from the designated trust advisor, the fiduciary shall be treated as an excluded fiduciary under the provisions of W.S. 4-10-715 and 4-10-717.

                  <p>(b) Subject to the rights of persons dealing with a fiduciary as provided in W.S. 4-10-1013, a sale, encumbrance or other transaction involving the investment or management of trust property entered into by the trustee for the trustee's own personal account or which is otherwise affected by a conflict between the trustee's fiduciary and personal interests is voidable by a beneficiary affected by the transaction unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The transaction was authorized by the terms of the trust;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The transaction was approved by the court;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The beneficiary did not commence a judicial proceeding within the time allowed by W.S. 4-10-1005;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The beneficiary consented to the trustee's conduct, ratified the transaction or released the trustee pursuant to W.S. 4-10-1009; or</p>
                  <p>(v) The transaction involves a contract entered into or claim acquired by the trustee before the person became or contemplated becoming trustee.</p>
                  <p>(c) A sale, encumbrance or other transaction involving the investment or management of trust property is presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if it is entered into by the trustee with:</p>
                  <p>(i) The trustee's spouse;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The trustee's descendants, siblings, parents or their spouses;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An agent or attorney of the trustee; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) A corporation or other person or enterprise in which the trustee, or a person that owns a significant interest in the trustee, has an interest that might affect the trustee's best judgment.</p>
                  <p>(d) A transaction between a trustee and a beneficiary that does not concern trust property but that occurs during the existence of the trust or while the trustee retains significant influence over the beneficiary and from which the trustee obtains an advantage beyond the normal commercial advantage from such a transaction, is voidable by the beneficiary unless the trustee establishes that the transaction was fair to the beneficiary.</p>
                  <p>(e) A transaction not concerning trust property in which the trustee engages in the trustee's individual capacity involves a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the transaction concerns an opportunity properly belonging to the trust.</p>
                  <p>(f) An investment by a trustee in securities of an investment company or investment trust to which the trustee, or its affiliate, provides services in a capacity other than as trustee is not presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the investment complies with the prudent investor rule as specified under article 9 of this act. The trustee may be compensated by the investment company or investment trust for providing those services out of fees charged to the trust if, as a condition precedent to receipt of such compensation, and at least annually, the trustee notifies the persons entitled under W.S. 4-10-813 to receive a copy of the trustee's annual report of the rate and method by which the compensation is determined by delivery of a prospectus or other communication.</p>
                  <p>(g) In voting shares of stock or in exercising powers of control over similar interests in other forms of enterprise, the trustee shall act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. If the trust is the sole owner of a corporation or other form of enterprise, the trustee shall elect or appoint directors or other managers who will manage the corporation or enterprise in the best interests of the beneficiaries.</p>
                  <p>(h) This section does not preclude the following transactions, if fair to the beneficiaries:</p>

                  <p>(a) A fiduciary who commits a breach of trust is liable to the beneficiaries affected for the greater of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount required to restore the value of the trust property and trust distributions to what they would have been had the breach not occurred; or</p>

                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if more than one (1) fiduciary is liable to the beneficiaries for a breach of trust, a fiduciary is entitled to contribution from the other fiduciary or fiduciaries. A fiduciary is not entitled to contribution if the fiduciary was substantially more at fault than another fiduciary or if the fiduciary committed the breach of trust in bad faith or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries. A fiduciary who received a benefit from the breach of trust is not entitled to contribution from another fiduciary to the extent of the benefit received.</p>

                  <p>(a) Instead of furnishing a copy of the trust instrument to a person other than a beneficiary, the trustee may furnish to the person a certification or affidavit of trust containing the following information:</p>
                  <p>(i) That the trust exists and the date the trust instrument was executed;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The identity of the settlor;</p>

                  <p>(iv) The pertinent powers of the trustee;</p>
                  <p>(v) The revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The authority of cotrustees to sign or otherwise authenticate and whether all or less than all are required in order to exercise powers of the trustee;</p>

                  <p>(viii) The manner of taking title to trust property.</p>
                  <p>(b) A certification or affidavit of trust shall be signed or otherwise authenticated by any trustee.</p>
                  <p>(c) A certification or affidavit of trust shall state that the trust has not been revoked, modified or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect.</p>
                  <p>(d) A certification or affidavit of trust need not contain the dispositive terms of a trust or the trust's taxpayer identification number.</p>
                  <p>(e) A recipient of a certification or affidavit of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments which designate the trustee and confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction.</p>
                  <p>(f) A person who acts in reliance upon a certification or affidavit of trust without knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification or affidavit. Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification or affidavit.</p>
                  <p>(g) A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification or affidavit of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification or affidavit were correct.</p>
                  <p>(h) A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification or affidavit of trust or excerpts is liable for damages if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding the trust instrument.</p>
                  <p>(j) This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.</p>

                  <p>(i) This act, applies to all trusts created on or after July 1, 2003;</p>
                  <p>(ii) This act applies to all judicial proceedings concerning trusts created on or after July 1, 2003, and to all judicial proceedings concerning trusts created before July 1, 2003 that have elected to be governed by this act as provided in subsection (c) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any rule of administration, construction or presumption provided in this act shall not apply to trust instruments executed before July 1, 2003, unless subsection (c) or (d) of this section is applicable;</p>
                  <p>(iv) An action taken before July 1, 2003, is not affected by this act and any review of actions taken before July 1, 2003 by a trustee or other person shall be reviewed under the law and standards applicable at the time the action was taken unless subsection (c) or (d) of this act is applicable.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a right is acquired, extinguished or barred upon the expiration of a prescribed period that has commenced to run under any other statute before July 1, 2003, that statute continues to apply to the right even if it has been repealed or superseded.</p>
                  <p>(c) This act applies to a trust created before July 1, 2003 if the settlor, if living, and all qualified beneficiaries consent to the application.
