                  <p>(b) If the transferee is a licensed dealer who holds the vehicle for resale, procures the certificate of title from the transferor and operates the vehicle only for demonstration purposes under dealer license plates, the dealer is not required to obtain a new certificate of title but may transfer the vehicle by an assignment and warranty of title upon the certificate of title or department approved statement of transfer form and deliver the certificate to a subsequent transferee.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event of a transfer by operation of law of any interest in a vehicle as upon an order in bankruptcy or insolvency, execution sale, repossession upon default in the performance of the terms of a lease or sales contract or otherwise than by voluntary act of the person whose title or interest is transferred, the administrator, receiver, trustee, sheriff, creditor or other representative or successor in interest of the person whose interest is transferred shall forward to the county clerk an application for a certificate of title together with a verified or certified statement of the transfer of interest.

If a transfer of title to a creditor is accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, a creditor retains the right to seek any deficiency balance which may exist after sale, provided the creditor has complied with all applicable law, and the transfer by itself shall not be considered a strict foreclosure or an election to retain the collateral in satisfaction of an obligation as provided by W.S. 34.1-9-620 and does not affect the debtor's right to redeem the collateral under W.S. 34.1-9-623. If from the records of the county clerk there appears to be any lien on the vehicle which was recorded prior to the lien of the creditor applying for title and which has not been released, the certificate of title shall contain a statement of the lien. The creditor repossessing and applying for title to the vehicle shall notify all persons holding liens on the vehicle by certified mail return receipt requested at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing the application for title. Any proceeds from the sale, lease or other disposition of the vehicle shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 34.1-9-608.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon loss of a certificate of title, the owner may apply to the county clerk issuing the original title for a duplicate title. The applicant shall file an affidavit describing the loss with the county clerk. Upon payment of fees the county clerk shall issue a duplicate certificate of title corresponding to the original certificate and containing the following notation prominently displayed in capital letters on the face of the certificate: "THIS IS A DUPLICATE CERTIFICATE OF TITLE AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE RIGHTS OF A PERSON OR PERSONS UNDER THE ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE".</p>
                  <p>(b) If an applicant for a certificate of title required by this act is unable to provide the county clerk with a certificate of title that assigns the prior owner's interest, a notarized bill of sale or other evidence of ownership that satisfies the county clerk that the applicant owns the vehicle, a certificate of title may be issued only if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The applicant submits an affidavit of vehicle ownership on a form prescribed by the department that shall be signed and sworn before a person who is authorized to administer oaths and affirmations. The affidavit shall contain:</p>

                  <p>(C) A disclosure of any and all security interests, liens or encumbrances that are known to the applicant and that are outstanding against the vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(D) A statement that the applicant is the true and lawful owner of the vehicle and has the right to have a certificate of title issued.</p>
                  <p>(ii) In addition to the affidavit of ownership, the applicant shall furnish the county clerk an indemnity bond as specified by this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the vehicle for which the applicant is applying for a certificate of title has a value less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00), a title may be issued without a bond if the applicant presents an affidavit of vehicle ownership, a notarized bill of sale, a certified, written statement of the value from a properly licensed Wyoming vehicle dealer and a vehicle identification number (VIN) inspection, or any other information the county clerk may require for proof of ownership, at the time of application.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any bond required by this section shall be executed by a surety duly authorized to carry on business in Wyoming or by individual sureties qualified as provided by W.S. 1-1-104 and 1-1-105. The amount of any bond required under this section shall not be less than double the value of the vehicle determined at the time of the application. If the value of the vehicle cannot be determined from any prior registration or title, the applicant shall provide the county clerk the value of the vehicle. The value of the vehicle shall be determined by the applicant or the surety from any current national appraisal guide, current or past registration if the value is present on any registration for the vehicle, or the value may be on certified written statement obtained from a properly licensed Wyoming vehicle dealer. The bond shall be conditioned to indemnify a prior owner, lienholder, subsequent purchaser, secured creditor or encumbrancer of the vehicle and any respective successors in interest against expenses, losses or damages, including reasonable attorney fees, caused by the issuance of the certificate of title or by a defect in or undisclosed security interest upon the right, title and interest of the applicant in the vehicle.</p>
                  <p>(e) If any person suffers a loss or damage by reason of the filing or issuance of the certificate of title as provided in this section, such person shall have a right of action to seek relief directly against the applicant and the surety on the applicant's bond against either of whom the person damaged may proceed independently of the other, but the aggregate liability of the surety to any or all persons seeking relief shall not exceed the total amount of the bond.</p>
                  <p>(f) If an applicant is applying for title to a vehicle which he will restore for his own personal use, title may be issued without a bond required by this section if the applicant presents an affidavit of vehicle ownership, a notarized bill of sale, a certified written statement of the value of the vehicle and a vehicle identification number (VIN) inspection, at the time of application. If the value of the vehicle cannot be determined from any prior registration or title, the applicant shall provide the county clerk the value of the vehicle. The value of the vehicle shall be determined from any current national appraisal guide, or the applicant may elect to submit a certified written statement obtained from a properly licensed Wyoming vehicle dealer stating the appraised value of the vehicle. Any title issued under this subsection shall state on its face that it is nontransferable for one hundred eighty (180) days from the date title issued. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subsection, a vehicle shall only be eligible to be titled under this subsection if, on the date the applicant purchased the vehicle it was not operational and could not have been rendered operational without substantial repairs to one (1) or more of the vehicle's mechanical systems. The department shall define the term "substantial repairs" by rule and regulation.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the owner of a mobile home who sells or transfers his interest in a mobile home for which a certificate of title has been issued shall endorse an assignment and warranty of title upon the certificate for the mobile home with a statement of all liens and encumbrances thereon and that all taxes due thereon have been paid, which assignment, warranty and statement shall be signed and dated by the owner before a notarial officer and acknowledged thereby in the manner provided by law, to be dated and delivered to the transferee at the time of delivering the mobile home.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the transferee is a mobile home dealer who holds the mobile home for resale and procures the certificate of title from the transferor, the dealer is not required to obtain a new certificate of title but may transfer the mobile home by an assignment and warranty of title upon the certificate of title and deliver the certificate to a subsequent transferee.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event of a transfer by operation of law of any interest in a mobile home as upon an order in bankruptcy or insolvency, execution sale, repossession upon default in the performance of the terms of a lease or sales contract or otherwise than by voluntary act of the person whose title or interest is transferred, the administrator, receiver, trustee, sheriff, creditor or other representative or successor in interest of the person whose interest is transferred shall forward to the county clerk an application for a certificate of title together with a verified or certified statement of the transfer of interest. The statement shall set forth the reason for the involuntary transfer, the interest transferred, the name of the transferee, the process or procedure effecting the transfer and other information requested by the county clerk. Evidence and instruments otherwise required by law to effect a transfer of legal or equitable title to or an interest in a mobile home in such cases shall be furnished with the statement. If a transfer of title to a creditor is accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, a creditor retains the right to seek any deficiency balance which may exist after sale, provided the creditor has complied with applicable law, and the transfer by itself shall not be considered a strict foreclosure or an election to retain the collateral in satisfaction of an obligation as provided by W.S. 34.1-9-620 and does not affect the debtor's right to redeem the collateral under W.S. 34.1-9-623. If from the records of the county clerk there appears to be any lien on the mobile home which was recorded prior to the lien of the creditor applying for title and which has not been released, the certificate of title shall contain a statement of the lien. The creditor repossessing and applying for title to the mobile home shall notify all persons holding liens on the mobile home by certified mail return receipt requested at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing the application for title. Any proceeds from the sale, lease or other disposition of the mobile home shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 34.1-9-610 and 34.1-9-615.</p>

                  <p>Before any transportable home or portion thereof, whose original movement commences within the state of Wyoming is conveyed upon any street or highway, the owner shall present a proof of ownership for each portion of a prebuilt or modular home, or a certificate of title or copy of the certificate of title if for a mobile home, to the county treasurer of the county in which the transportable home is located, and pay the current year's taxes as computed by the county treasurer.

In the event the ad valorem levy has not been set for the current year, the current year's tax shall be computed upon the levy for the previous year. Upon full payment of the current year's taxes due, the county treasurer shall issue a receipt describing the transportable home, indicating that a copy of the certificate of title was verified if applicable and indicating the current year's taxes are paid. Upon presentation of the receipt to the director of the department of transportation, or his authorized representative, the owner may be issued an over-width permit.</p>
                  <p>Payment of the taxes due on a transportable home is not required for the issuance of an over-width permit if the transportable home is abandoned and is moved pursuant to W.S. 31-13-101 through 31-13-116.

                  <p><shortTitle>31-2-801. Perfection of a security interest in a vehicle or motor vehicle.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Two (2) steps are required for perfection of a security interest in a vehicle or motor vehicle required to be licensed as hereinafter defined:</p>
                  <p>(i) A financing statement or security agreement must be filed in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the vehicle is located; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) A notation of the security interest must be endorsed on the certificate of title to the vehicle or motor vehicle, the endorsement to be made concurrently with the filing of the financing statement or security agreement.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each owner of a vehicle or motor vehicle concerning which an original or substitute certificate of title has been issued who encumbers the title thereto, shall deliver the certificate to the holder of the security interest who, within five (5) days thereafter, shall deliver the certificate to the clerk of the county in which the vehicle is located, and the clerk shall then endorse on the face of the certificate appropriate notation showing the date and amount of the security interest, and the name of the secured party. If such clerk issued the certificate, he shall immediately endorse the same security interest data on the certificate copy on file in his office. If the certificate was issued in some other county or state, he shall promptly transmit to the state or county officer who issued the certificate the same security interest data and such other officer shall promptly endorse same on the certificate copy on file in his office. Every financing statement or security agreement when filed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall take effect and be in force from and after the time of filing and not before, as to all creditors, subsequent purchasers, and holders of a security interest in good faith for valuable consideration and without notice.</p>
                  <p>(c) When a termination statement has been filed pursuant to W.S. 34.1-9-513, the owner of the motor vehicle shall present the certificate of title to the county clerk in whose office the financing statement has been filed, and the county clerk shall endorse a statement of the termination of the security interest on the face of the certificate. If the clerk issued the certificate of title, he shall endorse a like statement of termination of the security interest on the certificate copy on file in his office, but otherwise he shall promptly transmit to the state or county officer who issued the certificate of title the statement of termination for endorsement on the certificate copy on file in his office.</p>
                  <p>(d) The term "vehicle or motor vehicle required to be licensed" and the words "vehicle" and "motor vehicle" as used in this section means and includes all vehicles, motor vehicles, house trailers, trailers, semitrailers, motor coaches, trailer coaches, trucks, motorcycles, multipurpose vehicles and mobile homes required by the motor vehicle laws of the state of Wyoming to have a certificate of title or required to be registered or licensed under the laws of this state and includes off-road recreational vehicles for which a certificate of title has been issued under the laws of this state.</p>
                  <p>(e) Repealed by Laws 2003, Ch. 129, ยง 2.</p>
                  <p>(f) When the certificate of title to the vehicle or motor vehicle is not available for perfection under subsection (a) of this section, a "transitional ownership document", on a form prescribed by the department of transportation, may be filed with the financing statement or security agreement and the fee as specified in W.S. 18-3-402(a)(xvi)(T) to enable a security interest to be perfected in a timely manner. The transitional ownership document serves to perfect a lien upon the date of filing as to all creditors, subsequent purchasers and holders of a security interest in good faith for valuable consideration and without notice. No endorsement on the transitional ownership document is required to perfect the security interest. Within ninety (90) days from the date of the financing statement or security agreement, the certificate of title shall be filed along with a five dollar ($5.00) fee with the county clerk. If the certificate of title is not timely filed, the transitional ownership document is invalid, without force and effect.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of a motor vehicle or trailer that is not leased, or used, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, a transaction does not create a sale or security interest merely because the contract on which the transaction is based contains a terminal rental adjustment clause.</p>
                  <p>(b) As used in this section, "terminal rental adjustment clause" means a provision in a contract permitting or requiring the rental price of a motor vehicle or trailer to be adjusted either upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this section exempts a motor vehicle or trailer from the payment of any fees or taxes required at the time of titling or registering a vehicle under article 1 of this chapter.</p>

                <p>The displaying or exhibiting of a validly issued insurance identification card as provided by W.S. 31-8-201 by an operator or owner of the motor vehicle constitutes compliance with this section. No operator or owner of a motor vehicle charged with violating this section shall be convicted if he produces in court one (1) of the following which was valid at the time of arrest or at the time the citation was issued:</p>

                <p>(v) The verification system shall include appropriate provisions, consistent with industry standards, to secure its data against unauthorized access and to maintain a record of all information requests;</p>

                  <p>(i) The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the driver of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle on audible signal and shall not increase the speed of his vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.</p>
                  <p>(b) A driver of a passenger car, motorcycle, autocycle or pickup truck, not towing any other vehicle, may exceed the speed limit by up to ten (10) miles an hour while passing another vehicle traveling at less than the legal maximum speed, in order to safely pass the vehicle. The overtaking vehicle shall return to the right-hand lane and reduce speed to the posted speed limit as soon as practicable. This subsection shall be applicable only upon roadways divided into two (2) lanes for two (2) way movement of traffic and where the posted speed limit is fifty (50) miles per hour or greater. This subsection shall not be applicable in construction zones. Passing a vehicle pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to all other applicable motor vehicle laws. A driver of a vehicle exceeding the ten (10) mile per hour limitation of this subsection shall be subject to the full penalty or penalties applicable to exceeding the posted speed limit by the actual speed of the vehicle. As used in this section, "motorcycle," "passenger car," "pickup," "autocycle" and "vehicle" mean as defined in W.S. 31-1-101.</p>
                  <p>(c) The driver of a motor vehicle overtaking and passing a bicycle or electric bicycle, which is operating lawfully, proceeding in the same direction shall, when space allows, maintain at least a three (3) foot separation between the right side of the driver's motor vehicle, including all mirrors and other projections from the motor vehicle, and the bicycle or electric bicycle.</p>

                  <p>(g) The court may, upon pronouncement of any jail sentence under subsection (e) of this section, provide in the sentence that the defendant may be permitted, if he is employed or enrolled in school and can continue his employment or education, to continue such employment or education for not more than the time necessary as certified by his employer or school administrator, and the remaining day, days or parts of days shall be spent in jail until the sentence is served. He shall be allowed out of jail only long enough to complete his actual hours of employment or education and a reasonable time to travel to and from his place of employment or school.

                  <p>(a) Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one (1) at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a symbol or word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Green indication:</p>
                  <p>(A) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign prohibits either turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited;</p>
                  <p>(B) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indicators shown at the same time. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection;</p>
                  <p>(C) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as provided by W.S. 31-5-404, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Steady yellow indication:</p>
                  <p>(A) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter;</p>
                  <p>(B) Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided by W.S. 31-5-404, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Steady red indication:</p>
                  <p>(A) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(B) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication permitting the movement indicated by the red arrow is shown except as provided by subparagraph (C) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(C) Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street after stopping as required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection;</p>
                  <p>(D) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided by W.S. 31-5-404, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.</p>
                  <p>(b) If an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, this section is applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.</p>

                  <p>(i) Flashing Red (Stop Signal): When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed is subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal): When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past the signal only with caution.</p>

                  <p>(a) The driver of a vehicle upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any stopped school bus shall stop before reaching the school bus when there is in operation on the school bus the flashing red lights as specified in W.S. 31-5-929 and the driver shall not proceed until the school bus resumes motion or the flashing red lights are no longer actuated.</p>
                  <p>(b) Every school bus shall bear upon the front and rear thereof plainly visible signs containing the words "school bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in height, and in addition shall be equipped with red visual signals meeting the requirements of W.S. 31-5-929, which shall be actuated by the driver of the school bus whenever the vehicle is stopped and is receiving or discharging school children in designated school bus loading areas. When stopped to receive or discharge school children, the school bus driver shall keep the bus as far to the right of the roadway as reasonable. Except at a crosswalk, no school bus shall receive or discharge school children upon a roadway with four (4) or more lanes if the child would be required to cross a lane. The board of trustees of a school district may waive the requirement in this subsection that school bus drivers actuate visual signals if:</p>

                  <p>(e) A recording of images produced by a video system equipped on a school bus under W.S. 21-3-131(b)(x) shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it. A recorded image evidencing a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall be admissible in a judicial or administrative proceeding to adjudicate liability for the violation. If the identity of the driver of a vehicle that violates subsection (a) of this section is unknown, the registered owner of the vehicle recorded by a video system as provided in this subsection shall be fined one hundred ninety-five dollars ($195.00) provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) A fine issued to a registered owner of a vehicle under this subsection shall not be considered a moving violation for the purpose of suspending a driver's license under W.S. 31- 7-129 and shall not be considered a conviction under W.S. 31-5- 1201 or as a prior conviction for any other purpose; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) It shall be a defense to enforcement of a fine issued under this subsection that the registered owner of the vehicle:</p>
                  <p>(A) Did not provide express or implied consent to the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Transferred ownership of the vehicle to a new owner prior to the observed violation.</p>

                  <p>(i) Off-road recreational vehicles may be operated on main-traveled roadways only upon that portion of a public road right-of-way, street, road or highway designated open by the state, local or federal agency with jurisdiction over the roadway and designated a Wyoming off-road recreational vehicle trail pursuant to W.S. 31-2-701 through 31-2-707 by the department of state parks and cultural resources. No portion of a public road right-of-way, street, road or highway shall be designated as a Wyoming off-road recreational vehicle trail by the department without the consent of the state, local or federal agency with jurisdiction over the roadway. Off-road recreational vehicles operated upon roadways designated as trails shall be subject only to the user registration fee prescribed by W.S. 31-2-703 and shall not be deemed a motorcycle as defined in W.S. 31-1-101(a)(xv)(E)(I) and 31-5-102(a)(xxii).

                  <p>(ii) Crossings of main-traveled roadways shall be made at right angles to the roadway or as nearly so as practicable, but in any case yielding the right-of-way to all traffic in the main-traveled roadway;</p>
                  <p>(iii) When operating at any time from one-half ( \xBD) hour after sunset to one-half ( \xBD) hour before sunrise, the off- road recreational vehicle shall be equipped with lighted lamps and illuminating devices in accordance with W.S. 31-5-910 through 31-5-940;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The off-road recreational vehicle shall be equipped with an adequate braking device that may be operated either by hand or foot; and</p>
                  <p>(v) If operated on state or federal lands, the off- road recreational vehicle shall be equipped with:</p>

                <p><shortTitle>31-6-102. Test to determine alcoholic or controlled substance content of blood; suspension of license.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If arrested for an offense as defined by W.S. 31-5-233:</p>
                <p>(i) Any person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a public street or highway in this state is deemed to have given consent, subject to the provisions of this act, to a chemical test or tests of his blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or controlled substance content of his blood. The test or tests shall be:</p>
                <p>(A) Incidental to a lawful arrest;</p>
                <p>(B) Given as promptly as possible after the arrest;</p>
                <p>(C) Administered at the direction of a peace officer who has probable cause to believe the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a public street or highway in this state in violation of W.S. 31-5-233(b) or any other law prohibiting driving under the influence as defined by W.S. 31-5-233(a)(v). The peace officer who requires a test for alcohol concentration pursuant to this section may direct that the test shall be of blood, breath or urine. However, if the officer directs that the test be of the person's blood or urine, the person may choose whether the test shall be of blood or urine. The person shall not have the option if the peace officer has probable cause to believe there is impairment by a controlled substance which is not subject to testing by a breath test in which case a blood or urine test may be required, as directed by the peace officer.</p>
                <p>(ii) For tests required under this act, the arrested person shall be advised that:</p>
                <p>(A) Repealed By Laws 2011, Ch. 178, ยง 2.</p>
                <p>(B) If the results of the test indicate the person is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, he may be subject to criminal penalties, his Wyoming driver's license or his privilege to operate a motor vehicle shall be suspended for ninety (90) days and he may be required to drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device;</p>
                <p>(C) After undergoing all chemical tests required by the peace officer at a place and in a manner prescribed by and at the expense of the agency employing the peace officer, the arrested person may go to the nearest hospital or clinic and secure any additional tests at his own expense;</p>
                <p>(D) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 160, ยง 2.</p>
                <p>(iii) The results from the test or tests under this act shall only be used for the purposes of determining the chemical concentration as provided by this section and shall not be used for any other purpose.</p>
                <p>(b) Results of tests obtained at the arrested person's expense shall be made available to the arresting officer and the arrested person. Disclosure of the test results by the person administering the test is not a violation of the doctor-patient relationship.</p>
                <p>(c) Any person dead, unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him incapable of cooperating with the administration of the tests is deemed to have given his consent provided by subsection (a) of this section and the tests may be administered subject to the provisions of this act.</p>
                <p>(d) If a person under arrest refuses upon the request of a peace officer to submit to a chemical test designated by the agency employing the peace officer as provided in subsection (a) of this section, none shall be given except in cases where serious bodily injury or death has resulted or upon issuance of a search warrant. A test of the agency's choice may be administered upon issuance of a warrant, including a remotely communicated search warrant, when reasonable under the circumstances and as provided in this subsection. A remotely communicated search warrant may be issued upon sworn or affirmed testimony of the peace officer who is not in the physical presence of a judicial officer, provided the judicial officer is satisfied that probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant. All communication between the judicial officer and the peace officer or prosecuting attorney requesting the warrant may be remotely transmitted by voice, image, text or any combination thereof, or by other means and shall be recorded. The testimony and content of the warrant shall be recorded by writing or mechanical, magnetic, electronic, photographic storage or by other means. Upon approval, the judicial officer may direct a peace officer or the prosecuting attorney requesting a warrant from a remote location to sign the judicial officer's name on a warrant at a remote location. A remotely communicated search warrant shall be valid only for purposes specified in this subsection.</p>
                <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2011, Ch. 178, ยง 2.</p>
                <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2011, Ch. 178, ยง 2.</p>
                <p>(e) If the test result indicates the person has an alcohol concentration of eight one-hundredths of one percent (0.08%) or more, the peace officer shall submit his signed statement to the department. Based upon the statement the department shall suspend the person's Wyoming driver's license or his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state for ninety (90) days. If a criminal conviction results from the same incident on which a suspension under this subsection is based, the suspension under W.S. 31-7-128(b) or revocation under W.S. 31-7-127(a)(ii) shall be reduced by ninety (90) days. The statement submitted by the officer shall contain:</p>
                <p>(i) His probable cause to believe the arrested person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle:</p>
                <p>(A) On a public street or highway in this state;</p>
                <p>(B) In violation of W.S. 31-5-233(b) or any other law prohibiting driving under the influence as defined by W.S. 31-5-233(a)(v).</p>
                <p>(ii) That a test was taken of the person; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The person had an alcohol concentration of eight one-hundredths of one percent (0.08%) or more.</p>
                <p>(f) In addition to the signed statement submitted under subsection (e) of this section, the peace officer shall issue the person a temporary license similar to but in lieu of the license authorized under W.S. 31-7-138. This temporary license shall be valid for thirty (30) days, shall not be renewed, shall contain a notice that the person has twenty (20) days from the date of issuance within which to request a hearing from the department and that failure to timely request a hearing will result in the suspension automatically commencing upon expiration of the temporary license or upon expiration of any existing suspension or revocation if the person's license or privilege is suspended or revoked at the time the temporary license is issued. W.S. 31-7-138(d) and (e) apply to a license under this section. For purposes of this section, the peace officer acts as an agent for the department when providing notice of the suspension and notice of the opportunity for a hearing. W.S. 31-7-137 applies to a notice under this act. Failure to demand a hearing within the twenty (20) day period is a waiver of the right of hearing, and the suspension shall commence upon expiration of the temporary license or upon expiration of any existing suspension or revocation if the person's license or privilege is suspended or revoked at the time the temporary license is issued. If a timely demand for hearing is made, the department shall forward the demand to the independent hearing examiner who shall schedule a hearing within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the request and provide the arrested person at least ten (10) days notice of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by the hearing examiner. If the hearing examiner fails to schedule the hearing within forty-five (45) days of the request, other than at the request of the licensee, the licensee, as his sole remedy, shall be given credit against any action upheld at the hearing for the time between the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period and the date the hearing was first scheduled.</p>
                <p>(g) For the purposes of this section, the signed statement submitted by the peace officer shall be deemed a sworn statement and shall be subject to penalties for perjury.</p>

                <p>(b) The scope of a hearing for the purposes of this act shall cover the issues of whether a peace officer had probable cause to believe the arrested person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a public street or highway in this state in violation of W.S. 31-5-233(b) or any other law prohibiting driving under the influence as defined by W.S. 31-5-233(a)(v), whether the person was placed under arrest, or if a test was administered, whether the test results indicated that the person had an alcohol concentration of eight one-hundredths of one percent (0.08%) or more, and whether, except for the persons described in this act who are incapable of cooperating with the administration of the test, he had been given the advisements required by W.S. 31-6-102(a)(ii). At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing examiner shall order that the suspension either be rescinded or sustained. If a chemical test was administered, the hearing examiner has the same authority to modify a license suspension under this act as he does under W.S. 31-7-105.</p>
                <p>(c) Prehearing discovery, available to any interested party is limited to access to the notice of suspension, signed statement and any accompanying documentation submitted by the arresting officer. Other types of discovery available under other law are not available in a hearing under this section.</p>

                <p>(a) If arrested for an offense as defined by W.S. 31-5-234:</p>
                <p>(i) A person under twenty-one (21) years of age who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state is deemed to have given consent, subject to the provisions of this section, to a chemical test or tests of his blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration in his blood;</p>
                <p>(ii) The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of a peace officer, who has probable cause to believe that the driver was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle in this state in violation of W.S. 31-5-234(b). The peace officer who requires a test pursuant to this section may direct that the test shall be of blood, breath or urine.</p>
                <p>However, if the officer directs that the test be of the person's blood or urine, the person may choose whether the test shall be of blood or urine;</p>
                <p>(iii) The test or tests results shall only be used for the purposes of determining the chemical concentration as provided by this section and shall not be used for any other purpose.</p>
                <p>(b) For tests required under this section, the person shall be advised that:</p>
                <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2011, Ch. 178, ยง 2.</p>
                <p>(ii) If the results of the test indicate an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent (0.02%) or more, he may be subject to denial or suspension of his driver's license for the period specified by W.S. 31-7-128(h) and he may be required to drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device;</p>
                <p>(iii) After all chemical tests required by the peace officer have been administered at a place and in the manner prescribed by and at the expense of the agency employing the peace officer, the arrested person may go to the nearest hospital or clinic and secure any additional tests at his own expense.</p>
                <p>(c) Results of tests obtained at the person's expense shall be made available to the peace officer and the person. Disclosure of the test results by the person administering the test is not a violation of the doctor-patient relationship.</p>
                <p>(d) Any person dead, unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him incapable of cooperating with the administration of the tests is deemed to have given his consent provided for in this section, and the tests may be administered subject to this section. A chemical test designated by the agency employing the peace officer may also be administered to a person who refuses to take a test upon issuance of a search warrant, including a remotely communicated search warrant, as provided in W.S. 31-6-102(d). A remotely communicated search warrant shall be valid only for purposes specified in this subsection.</p>

                <p>(f) If a test discloses an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent (0.02%) or more, the peace officer shall issue the person a temporary license similar to but in lieu of the license authorized under W.S. 31-7-138. This temporary license shall be valid for thirty (30) days, shall not be renewed, shall contain a notice that the person has twenty (20) days from the date of issuance within which to request a hearing from the department pursuant to W.S. 31-7-105 and that failure to timely request a hearing will result in the period of suspension or license denial automatically commencing upon expiration of the temporary license or upon expiration of any existing suspension or revocation if the person's license or privilege is suspended or revoked at the time the temporary license is issued. For purposes of this section, the peace officer acts as an agent for the department when providing notice of the suspension and notice of the opportunity for a hearing. W.S. 31-7-137 applies to a notice under this act. Failure to demand a hearing within the twenty (20) day period is a waiver of the right of hearing, and the period of suspension or denial shall commence upon expiration of the temporary license or upon expiration of any existing suspension or revocation if the person's license or privilege is suspended or revoked at the time the temporary license is issued. A temporary license issued under this subsection shall afford no driving privilege to a person who is not otherwise licensed to drive a motor vehicle.</p>
                <p>(g) A timely request for a hearing shall stay the period of suspension or denial until the order following the hearing is entered and all appellate review of the matter is completed, provided the stay is effective only so long as there is no license suspension or denial for a similar violation during the hearing and appeal period.</p>
                <p>(h) At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing examiner shall order whether or not the person's driver's license shall be suspended or denied. The scope of the hearing shall be limited to the issues of:</p>
                <p>(i) Whether the peace officer had probable cause to believe the person was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle with an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent (0.02%) or more;</p>
                <p>(ii) Whether the results of a test indicated there was an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths of one percent (0.02%) or more;</p>
                <p>(iii) Whether the person had been given the advisement required in subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Whether the person has shown good cause as to why his license should not be suspended or denied, regardless of the findings in paragraphs (i) through (iii) of this subsection.</p>

Any driver's license suspension or related records under this section shall not be the basis for any increase in insurance premiums or the cancellation of any insurance policy for a minor or his parents affected by this section.</p>

                  <p>Every licensee shall have his driver's license in his immediate possession at all times when driving a motor vehicle and shall display the license upon demand of any judicial officer, municipal court judge, any officer or agent of the division or any police officer as defined in W.S. 31-5-102(a)(xxxiii).</p>
                  <p>However, no person charged with violating this section shall be convicted if he produces in court a driver's license previously issued to him and valid at the time of his arrest. For the purposes of this section "display" of a physical license means the surrender of the physical license to the demanding officer. After examination the officer shall immediately return the license to the licensee except as provided in W.S. 31-5-1205(k). For purposes of this section "display" of a digital driver's license means that a licensee may provide access to the digital driver's license on the licensee's portable electronic device.</p>
                  <p>No law enforcement or judicial officer demanding display of a licensee's digital driver's license for any licensing or identification verification purpose shall take custody of the licensee's portable electronic device. Display of a digital driver's license shall not serve as consent to search the driver's portable electronic device. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person, other than the department if it has chosen to issue a digital driver's license, to accept a digital driver's license or otherwise require the purchase of equipment to verify the accuracy of a digital driver's license.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>31-7-117. Restricted licenses.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Upon issuing a driver's license the division for good cause may impose restrictions suitable to the licensee's driving ability. The restrictions may require special mechanical control devices on any motor vehicle which the licensee may drive and any other restrictions upon the licensee the division determines to be necessary and reasonably likely to assure the safe driving of any motor vehicle by the licensee. The division may issue a restricted license to a person whose license has otherwise been suspended or revoked, as provided in article 4 of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(b) The division may issue a special restricted license or may state the restrictions on the license form.</p>
                  <p>(c) The division may issue a restricted class "C" or "M" license, or both such licenses, to a person who is between the ages of fourteen (14) and sixteen (16) years upon receipt of application, payment of the proper fees, an affidavit of extreme inconvenience signed by the parent or guardian having custody of the applicant and a finding by the highway patrol that extreme inconvenience actually exists. The applicant shall successfully pass the examination required by W.S. 31-7-114. The licensee may drive a vehicle only between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., within a fifty (50) mile radius of his domicile and only at the direction of his parent or guardian. If any person while licensed under this subsection, receives a citation for a moving violation, the division, upon receipt of the notice of conviction, shall suspend the license and any other license or permit evidencing that person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle. For purposes of this subsection "extreme inconvenience" includes the following circumstances:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person must drive to school and the person's residence is more than five (5) miles from the school;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The person has a regular job more than five (5) miles from the person's residence;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The person must have the license to work in his parent's business; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any other circumstance which the highway patrol finds is an extreme inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon receiving satisfactory evidence of any violation of the restrictions of the license, the division may cancel, suspend or revoke the license but the licensee is entitled to a hearing under W.S. 31-7-105.</p>
                  <p>(e) It is a misdemeanor to drive a motor vehicle in violation of the restrictions imposed in a restricted license issued pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) A person who is at least fifteen (15) years of age who holds a restricted class "C" license may drive beyond the hours and radius specified in subsection (c) of this section if the person is accompanied by a person who:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is at least eighteen (18) years of age;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Is licensed to drive as a driver for the type or class of vehicle being used;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Is fit and capable of exercising control over the vehicle; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Is occupying a seat beside the driver.</p>
                  <p>(g) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, any license issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall only be used for the situation creating the extreme hardship and shall only be valid when accompanied by and used in conjunction with the statement restriction listing the circumstances of the extreme inconvenience. The statement of restrictions is to be issued by the department pursuant to the highway patrol's investigation. Drivers convicted of violating this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) Every driver's license shall expire on the licensee's birthday in the fifth year following the issuance of the license.</p>
                  <p>(b) The division shall require every person applying for renewal of a driver's license to take and successfully pass a test of his eyesight. The division may require any applicant to take and successfully pass any additional tests or provide affidavits required or authorized under the original application as the division finds reasonably necessary to determine his qualification according to the type or class of license. The written test for a hazardous materials endorsement shall be taken and passed if the person wants to retain an "H" endorsement unless the applicant's written test results are less than two (2) years old.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, the division may defer the expiration of the license of a licensee who is on active duty in the armed forces of the United States for successive five (5) year periods, upon terms and conditions as it may prescribe. The division may similarly defer the expiration of the license of the spouse or dependent child of the person in the armed forces if residing with that person.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as provided in article 4 of this chapter, any person whose license or privilege to drive a motor vehicle on the public highways has been revoked is not entitled to apply for a new license until the expiration of the period of revocation. Any person making false application for a new license before the expiration of the period of revocation is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, a fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), or both.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the driver's license of any person who has not attained his twenty-first birthday may be renewed within thirty (30) days prior to the date of his twenty-first birthday upon application, payment of the required fee and satisfactory completion of the examination required or authorized by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) Once in any ten (10) year period, a driver's license may be extended for a five (5) year period without the examination required by subsection (b) of this section for a licensee:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whose license has not been suspended or revoked in the five (5) years immediately preceding the date of license expiration;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Who, according to affidavits required by the division indicates no medical impairment which might represent a hazard to public safety;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whose license is not restricted pursuant to W.S. 31-7-117(c);</p>
                  <p>(iv) Who does not have a material change in any personally identifiable information that requires the applicant to present one (1) of the documents listed in W.S. 31-7-111(a).</p>
                  <p>(g) The division shall send a notification for license extension pursuant to subsection (f) of this section to the last known address of an eligible licensee, or notify by electronic means if the eligible licensee has consented to receive notices electronically, within one hundred twenty (120) days prior to license expiration. The license extension application shall be returned to the division with a postmark at least thirty (30) days before the license expiration date or, if the eligible licensee has consented to receive notices electronically, by electronic means at least thirty (30) days before the license expiration date. The application shall be accompanied by written evidence that the applicant's visual acuity is 20/40 or better with or without corrective lenses, as tested within one (1) year prior to submitting the application. Upon receipt of a completed application and the fee prescribed by W.S. 31-7- 113(a)(v), the division shall issue a license extension to eligible licensees. The division shall provide a summary of changes in the law relating to motor vehicles to licensees who receive a license extension.</p>

For any person whose records of a driver's license suspension were expunged under this subsection, the suspension under this subsection is deemed not to have occurred and the individual may reply accordingly upon any inquiry in the matter. Notwithstanding W.S. 31-5-1214, records of suspensions under W.S. 31-7-128(f) shall not be made available for public inspection except for inspection by any law enforcement officer or agency.

                  <p>(ii) Otherwise, each record received shall be forwarded to the jurisdiction in which the license was issued and shall indicate:</p>
                  <p>(A) The licensee was not convicted and is otherwise entitled to receive his license or driving privileges; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The licensee was convicted.</p>

                  <p>The Driver License Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in form substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I</p>
                  <p>Findings and Declaration of Policy</p>
                  <p>(a) The party states find that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.</p>
                  <p>(b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE II</p>
                  <p>Definitions</p>
                  <p>(a) As used in this compact:</p>
                  <p>(i) "State" means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Home state" means the state which has issued and has the power to suspend or revoke the use of the license or permit to operate a motor vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Conviction" means a conviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle which is prohibited by state law, municipal ordinance or administrative rule or regulation, or a forfeiture of bail, bond or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, and which conviction or forfeiture is required to be reported to the licensing authority.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE III</p>
                  <p>Report of Convictions</p>
                  <p>(a) The licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Clearly identify the person convicted;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Identify the court in which action was taken;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered, or conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Include any special findings made in connection therewith.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IV</p>
                  <p>Effect of Conviction</p>
                  <p>(a) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III of this Compact, as it would if such conduct has occurred in the home state, in the case of convictions for:</p>
                  <p>(i) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug, or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Failure to stop and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another.</p>
                  <p>(b) As to other convictions, reported pursuant to Article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such effect to the conduct as is provided by laws of the home state.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this Article, such party state shall construe the denominations and descriptions appearing in the subdivision (a) hereof as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this Article.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V</p>
                  <p>Applications for New Licenses</p>
                  <p>(a) Upon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state. The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one (1) year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law. The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant, if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>Applicability of Other Laws</p>
                  <p>Except as expressly required by provisions of this Compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VII</p>
                  <p>Compact Administrator and Interchange of Information</p>
                  <p>(a) The head of the licensing authority of each party state shall be the administrator of this Compact for this state. The administrators, acting jointly, shall have the power to formulate all necessary and proper procedures for the exchange of information under this Compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) The administrator of each party state shall furnish to the administrator of each other party state any information or documents reasonably necessary to facilitate the administration of this Compact.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
                  <p>Entry Into Force and Withdrawal</p>
                  <p>(a) This Compact shall enter into force and become effective as to any state when it has enacted the same into law.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until six (6) months after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the licensing authorities of states remaining party to the Compact of any report of conviction occurring prior to the withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IX</p>
                  <p>Construction and Severability</p>
                  <p>This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any party state thereto, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>31-7-307. Implied consent requirements for commercial motor vehicle drivers.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A person who drives or is in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle within this state is deemed to have given consent, subject to the provisions of this section to a chemical test or tests of his blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining alcohol or controlled substance concentration in his blood.</p>
                  <p>(b) The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of a peace officer, who has probable cause to believe that the driver was driving or in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle in this state while having alcohol or a controlled substance in his system. The peace officer who requires a test pursuant to this section may direct that the test shall be of blood, breath or urine. However, if the officer directs that the test be of the person's blood or urine, the person may choose whether the test shall be of blood or urine. The person has this option unless the peace officer has probable cause to believe there is a controlled substance which is not subject to testing by a blood or breath test in which case a urine test may be required.</p>
                  <p>(c) For tests required under this section, the person shall be advised that:</p>

                  <p>(d) Results of tests obtained at the person's expense shall be made available to the peace officer and the person. Disclosure of the test results by the person administering the test is not a violation of the doctor-patient relationship.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any person dead, unconscious or otherwise in a condition rendering him incapable of cooperating with the administration of the tests is deemed to have given his consent provided for in this section, and the tests may be administered subject to this section. A chemical test designated by the agency employing the peace officer may also be administered to a person who refuses to take a test upon issuance of a search warrant, including a remotely communicated search warrant, as provided in W.S. 31-6-102(d). A remotely communicated search warrant shall be valid only for purposes specified in this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the person refuses testing or is administered a test which discloses an alcohol concentration of four one- hundredths of one percent (0.04%) or more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood the peace officer shall submit a signed statement to the department.

                  <p>(iii) That the person refused to submit to a test or submitted to a test which disclosed an alcohol concentration of four one-hundredths of one percent (0.04%) or more.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon receipt of the signed statement of a peace officer submitted under subsection (f) of this section, the department shall disqualify the driver from driving a commercial motor vehicle under W.S. 31-7-305 subject to the hearing provision therein.</p>
                  <p>(h) A timely request for a hearing shall stay the disqualification until the order following the hearing is entered provided the stay of disqualification is effective only so long as there is no disqualification for a similar violation during the hearing and appeal period.</p>
                  <p>(j) At the conclusion of a hearing, the hearing examiner shall order the disqualification be rescinded or sustained. The scope of the hearing shall be limited to the issues of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether the peace officer had probable cause to believe the person was driving or in actual physical control of a commercial vehicle with alcohol or a controlled substance in his system;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether the results of a test indicated there was at least four one-hundredths of one percent (0.04%) of alcohol in the person's blood; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether the person had been given the advisement required in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) Prehearing discovery available to any party is limited to access to the notice of disqualification, signed statement, and any accompanying documentation submitted by the peace officer. Other types of discovery available under other laws are not available under this section.</p>
                  <p>(m) If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test under this section, evidence of the refusal is admissible in any administrative, civil or criminal action or proceeding arising from acts alleged to have been committed while driving or in actual physical control of a commercial vehicle.</p>

                  <p>(i) "Ignition interlock device" means an alcohol breath screening device connected to the engine's ignition system, that prevents the vehicle from starting when it detects an alcohol concentration over an established limit. The device shall contain a data logger which retains records of every instance in which the device prevented the engine from starting during the period between recalibrations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Ignition interlock service provider" means any person who installs, services, monitors, calibrates or repairs ignition interlock devices and who must be certified by the department to perform such work.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations for the certification of ignition interlock devices and ignition interlock service providers and for the calibration and maintenance of ignition interlock devices, which calibration and maintenance shall be the responsibility of an ignition interlock service provider. In addition to other matters necessary for the administration of this article, the rules and regulations shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Prohibit any ignition interlocking device from being sold or installed in this state without the device and the ignition interlock service provider being certified by the department;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Require that each ignition interlock service provider provide a reasonable service where such devices may be obtained, repaired, replaced, serviced and calibrated;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Require that every ignition interlock service provider provide monthly reports for each ignition interlocking device data logger;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Require that ignition interlock service providers check, calibrate and service each ignition interlock device installed by that provider at least every sixty (60) days and adopt a reporting requirement should the provider find evidence of tampering;</p>
                  <p>(v) Require that each ignition interlock service provider retain all data logger records for three (3) years;</p>

                  <p>(vii) Establish procedures under which indigent persons who are required to operate only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device may have one-half (1/2) the costs of obtaining and using such device paid from funds made available by the state. A person shall be considered indigent if they are able to produce evidence that they are eligible and qualified to participate in the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations and prescribe forms related to the issuance of ignition interlock restricted licenses as provided in this article.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department shall establish a fee chargeable to every person applying for an ignition interlock restricted license. The fee shall compensate the department for all the costs directly associated with operating the ignition interlock program required by this article, but in no event shall the fee exceed one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00). The fee shall not be collected from any indigent person who qualifies for the benefits described by paragraph (b)(vii) of this section.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>31-8-101. Issuance to residents by department; restrictions; limited to one state-issued credential; digital identification card; definitions; rulemaking.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any Wyoming resident may be issued an identification card by the department of transportation if the resident does not possess or surrenders any other state-issued, REAL ID Act or other applicable federal law compliant driver's license or identification card. The application shall state the registrant's full legal name, social security number, date of birth and any other identifying data the department may require and shall be signed and verified by the applicant. The identification card shall at the applicant's request indicate that the applicant is an anatomical organ donor as provided by W.S. 35-5-205 or that the applicant has a medical alert designation as provided for in W.S. 31-7-142. Before receiving an identification card under this chapter a person who previously has been licensed or issued an identification card in this or any other state but who does not have the credential in their possession shall complete an affidavit of "No License/ID Card in Possession."</p>
                  <p>(b) The department shall not issue an identification card until documentary evidence of the applicant's age and identity has been verified using documents as provided by W.S. 31-7-111.</p>
                  <p>(c) An identification card issued under subsection (a) of this section may include a digital identification card. A digital identification card may be issued upon request of a registrant and payment of the required fee. No digital identification card shall be issued unless the applicant holds the corresponding physical identification card or unless the corresponding physical identification card is issued simultaneously. A registrant may display a digital identification card by providing access to the digital identification card on the registrant's portable electronic device. No law enforcement or judicial officer demanding display of a registrant's digital identification card for any identification verification purpose shall take custody of the registrant's portable electronic device. Display of a digital identification card shall not serve as consent to search the registrant's portable electronic device. A digital identification card shall be designed in accordance with W.S. 31-7-115(d)(i) and (ii). Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person, other than the department if it has chosen to issue a digital identification card, to accept a digital identification card or otherwise require the purchase of equipment to verify the accuracy of a digital identification card.</p>
                  <p>(d) As used in this chapter:</p>

A digital identification card is optional to purchase, supplemental to a physical identification card and may be accepted in lieu of a physical identification card at the option of the person requesting or requiring proof of identification;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Portable electronic device" means as defined in W.S. 31-7-102(a)(li);</p>
                  <p>(iii) "REAL ID Act" means the REAL ID Act of 2005, Public Law 109-13, 119 Stat. 302, enacted May 11, 2005, and subsequent amendments thereto.</p>

                  <p>(a) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an investigating officer's report of a motor vehicle accident within this state as required under W.S. 31-5-1106 through 31-5-1108 or after a demand for additional security under W.S. 31-9-207(b), the division shall with respect to each driver and motor vehicle involved in the accident, and except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, suspend:</p>
                  <p>(i) The Wyoming driver's license of each driver of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All Wyoming registrations of each owner whose motor vehicle is required to be registered in this state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The nonresident driving privilege of each driver of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The nonresident driving privilege of each owner of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state.</p>
                  <p>(b) The suspension in subsection (a) of this section shall be imposed unless the driver, the owner or both file proof of financial responsibility.</p>
                  <p>(c) This section does not apply to:</p>
                  <p>(i) An owner if the owner had in effect at the time of the accident an automobile liability policy with respect to the motor vehicle involved in the accident;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The driver, if not the owner of the motor vehicle, if there was in effect at the time of the accident an automobile liability policy or bond with respect to his operation of motor vehicles not owned by him;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The driver or owner whose liability for damages resulting from the accident is, in the judgment of the division, covered by any other form of liability insurance policy or surety bond;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any person qualifying as a self-insurer under W.S. 31-9-414; or</p>
                  <p>(v) The owner or driver, if a personal surety bond is filed with the division in an amount required by the division under this act with at least two (2) individual sureties each owning real estate within the state, which real estate shall be scheduled in the bond to be approved by a judge of the district court.</p>
                  <p>(d) No insurance policy or surety bond is effective under this section unless issued by an insurance company or surety company authorized to do business in this state, except that if the motor vehicle was not registered in this state, or was a motor vehicle which was registered elsewhere than in this state at the effective date of the policy or bond, or the most recent renewal thereof, the policy or bond is not effective under this section unless the insurance company or surety company if not authorized to do business in this state executes a power of attorney authorizing the division to accept service on its behalf of notice or process in any action upon the policy or bond arising out of the accident. Every policy or bond shall be subject, if the accident has resulted in bodily injury or death, to a limit, exclusive of interest and costs, of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in any one (1) accident and, subject to the limit for one (1) person, to a limit of not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident, and, if the accident has resulted in injury to or destruction of property, to a limit of not less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon receipt of notice of the accident, the insurance company or surety company which issued the policy or bond shall furnish for filing with the division a written notice that the policy or bond was in effect at the time of the accident. This subsection does not apply to any person holding a motor carrier permit or certificate under W.S. 31-18-209 who furnishes proof of financial responsibility by filing a certificate of insurance under W.S. 31-9-402(a)(i) or a bond under W.S. 31-9-402(a)(ii) if the certificate or bond:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is a continuing certificate or bond;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Remains in full force and effect until cancelled; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) May not be cancelled until notice in writing of the cancellation has been on file with the division for thirty (30) days.</p>

                  <p>(iii) To the owner of a motor vehicle if at the time of the accident the vehicle was being driven without his permission, express or implied, or was parked by a person who had been driving the motor vehicle without permission;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If, prior to the date that the division would otherwise suspend license and registration or nonresident's operating privilege under W.S. 31-9-202, there shall be filed with the division satisfactory evidence that the person who would otherwise have to file security has been released from liability or been finally adjudicated not to be liable or has executed a warrant for confession of judgment, payable in installments as the parties have agreed, or has executed a duly acknowledged written agreement providing for the payment of an agreed amount in installments, with respect to all claims for injuries or damages resulting from the accident.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this act "liability policy" means an owner's or an operator's policy of liability insurance, certified as provided in W.S. 31-9-403 or 31-9-404 as proof of financial responsibility, and issued, except as otherwise provided in W.S. 31-9-404, by an insurance carrier authorized to transact business in this state, to or for the benefit of the person named as insured.</p>
                  <p>(b) An owner's policy of liability insurance shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is to be granted; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Insure the person named and, except for persons specifically excluded pursuant to W.S. 26-35-105, any other person, as insured, using any covered motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named insured against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the motor vehicle within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs with respect to each motor vehicle, as follows: twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of one (1) person in any one (1) accident and, subject to the limit for one (1) person, fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of bodily injury to or death of two (2) or more persons in any one (1) accident and twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one (1) accident.</p>
                  <p>(c) An operator's policy of liability insurance shall insure the person named as insured against loss from the liability imposed upon him by law for damages arising out of the use by him of any motor vehicle not owned by him, within the same territorial limits and subject to the same limits of liability as provided by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) The motor vehicle liability policy shall state the name and address of the named insured, the coverage afforded by the policy, the premium charged therefor, the policy period and the limits of liability, and shall contain an agreement or be endorsed that insurance is provided in accordance with the coverage defined in this act as respects bodily injury and death or property damage, or both, and is subject to all the provisions of this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) The motor vehicle liability policy shall not insure any liability under any worker's compensation law nor any liability on account of bodily injury to or death of an employee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured, or while engaged in the operation, maintenance or repair of any motor vehicle nor any liability or damage to property owned by, rented to, in charge of or transported by the insured.</p>
                  <p>(f) Every motor vehicle liability policy is subject to the following provisions which need not be contained therein:</p>
                  <p>(i) The liability of the insurance carrier with respect to the insurance required by this act shall become absolute whenever injury or damage covered by the motor vehicle liability policy occurs. The policy may not be cancelled or annulled as to the liability by any agreement between the insurance carrier and the insured after the occurrence of the injury or damage. No statement made by the insured or on his behalf and no violation of the policy shall defeat or void the policy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The satisfaction by the insured of a judgment for injury or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right or duty of the insurance carrier to make payment on account of the injury or damage;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The insurance carrier may settle any claim covered by the policy, and if settlement is made in good faith, the amount thereof shall be deductible from the limits of liability specified in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The policy, the written application therefor, if any, and any rider or endorsement which does not conflict with this act shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any policy which grants the coverage required for a motor vehicle liability policy may also grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage specified for a motor vehicle liability policy and the excess or additional coverage is not subject to this act. With respect to a policy which grants excess or additional coverage the "liability policy" shall apply only to that part of the coverage which is required by this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide that the insured shall reimburse the insurance carrier for any payment the insurance carrier would not have been obligated to make under the terms of the policy except for the provisions of this act.</p>
                  <p>(j) Any motor vehicle liability policy may provide for the prorating of the insurance thereunder with other valid and collectible insurance.</p>
                  <p>(k) The requirements for a motor vehicle liability policy may be fulfilled by the policies of one (1) or more insurance carriers which policies together meet the requirements.</p>
                  <p>(m) Any binder issued pending the issuance of a motor vehicle liability policy shall be deemed to fulfill the requirements for the policy.</p>

Except as provided in W.S. 31-9-202(d), the bond shall be filed with the division and is not cancelable except after ten (10) days written notice to the division. The bond constitutes a lien in favor of the state upon the real estate scheduled of any surety and the lien shall exist in favor of any holder of a final judgment against the person who has filed the bond, for damages, including damages for care and loss of services, because of bodily injury to or death of any person, or for damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, resulting from the ownership, maintenance, use or operation of a motor vehicle after the bond was filed, upon the filing of notice to that effect by the division in the office of the proper clerk or court of the county or city where the real estate is located. The notice shall be recorded and indexed in the same manner as now provided by law for real estate mortgages.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a judgment, rendered against the principal on the bond is not satisfied within thirty (30) days after it becomes final, the judgment creditor may, for his own use and benefit and at his sole expense, bring an action in the name of the state against the company or persons executing the bond, including an action or proceeding to foreclose any lien that may exist upon the real estate of a person who has executed the bond. The foreclosure shall be by proceeding in the district court of the county where the real estate is located unless it is in more than one (1) county in which case the action shall be brought in any county in which any of the property is situated.</p>

                <p>(viii) Repealed by Laws 1997, ch. 154, ยง 3.</p>
                <p>(ix) Violate any provision of the federal motor vehicle safety standards;</p>
                <p>(x) Display for sale, exchange or sell any new motor vehicle for which the vehicle dealer does not hold a valid franchise;</p>
                <p>(xi) Import, display for sale, exchange, or sell, any new vehicle, or any used vehicle originally sold by a manufacturer for distribution outside the United States unless the vehicle is in compliance with all federal regulations governing vehicles that were manufactured for distribution outside the United States and subsequently imported into the United States. Any dealer required to be licensed under this act shall maintain records in his principal place of business necessary to verify compliance with this provision if requested by the department or any law enforcement officer;</p>
                <p>(xii) Advertise, display, demonstrate, exchange or sell any vehicle with less than one thousand (1,000) miles on the odometer, unless the person is a properly licensed dealer, or the person has obtained a valid Wyoming title in his name or business name and has paid the applicable sales or use tax on the vehicle in his name before advertising, displaying, demonstrating, exchanging or selling the vehicle.</p>
                <p>(b) No manufacturer licensed under this act shall require or coerce or attempt to require or coerce any new vehicle dealer in this state:</p>
                <p>(i) To order or accept delivery of any new vehicle, vehicle part or accessory, equipment or any other commodity not required by law which the new vehicle dealer has not voluntarily ordered. This paragraph does not modify or supersede any terms or provisions of the franchise requiring new vehicle dealers to market a representative line of the vehicles covered by the franchise, to promote the sale, leasing and rental of the vehicles and to carry a reasonable inventory of models offered for sale by the manufacturer;</p>
                <p>(ii) To order or accept delivery of any new vehicle with special features, accessories or equipment not included in the list price of those vehicles as publicly advertised by the manufacturer or distributor unless they are required by law;</p>
                <p>(iii) To participate monetarily in an advertising campaign or contest or to purchase any promotional materials, training materials, showroom or other display decorations or materials at the expense of the new vehicle dealer. This paragraph does not modify any provisions of the franchise requiring the dealer to advertise and promote the sale of vehicles covered by the franchise and does not apply to campaigns, contests, advertising and other promotional programs in which the dealer voluntarily participates;</p>
                <p>(iv) To enter into any agreement with the manufacturer or to prejudice the new vehicle dealer by threatening to terminate or cancel a franchise or any contractual agreement existing between the dealer and the manufacturer. This paragraph does not preclude the manufacturer or distributor from insisting on compliance with the reasonable terms or provisions of the franchise or other contractual agreement. Notice in good faith from a manufacturer or distributor to any new vehicle dealer of the new vehicle dealer's violation of those terms or provisions does not constitute a violation of this act;</p>
                <p>(v) To change the capital structure of the new vehicle dealer or the new vehicle dealer's financing means if the new vehicle dealer meets any reasonable capital standards determined by the manufacturer in accordance with uniformly applied criteria. A new vehicle dealer may change its capital structure in accordance with reasonable capital standards if the change does not change the principal management or ownership in whole or in part or result in the sale of the franchise. If a change in capital structure results in a sale of the franchise, the manufacturer or distributor may not unreasonably withhold any necessary consent to the change;</p>
                <p>(vi) To refrain from participation in the management of, investment in or the acquisition of any other line of new vehicle or related products. This paragraph does not apply unless the new vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new vehicle, the new vehicle dealer remains in compliance with any reasonable facilities and other franchise requirements of the manufacturer and no change is made in the principal management of the new vehicle dealer;</p>
                <p>(vii) To prospectively agree to relieve any person from liability imposed by this law or to require any controversy between a new vehicle dealer and a manufacturer, distributor or their representatives, to be referred to any person other than the duly constituted courts of the state or the United States, or to the director if the referral would be binding upon the new vehicle dealer;</p>
                <p>(viii) To establish, after becoming a new vehicle dealer, exclusive facilities, personnel or display space for a line make when such requirements would not be justified by reasonable business considerations;</p>
                <p>(ix) To expand facilities without making available a sufficient supply of new vehicles to justify an expansion considering the market and economic conditions;</p>
                <p>(x) To modify significantly an existing dealership or to construct a new vehicle dealership facility without a sufficient supply of new vehicles to justify a modification or construction considering the market and economic conditions.</p>
                <p>(c) No manufacturer licensed under this act shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Delay, refuse or fail to deliver new vehicles or new vehicle parts or accessories in a reasonable time and quantity relative to the new vehicle dealer's facilities and sales potential in the new vehicle dealer's relevant market area after acceptance of an order from a new vehicle dealer having a franchise for the retail sale of any new vehicle sold or distributed by the manufacturer, any new vehicle, parts or accessories to new vehicles as are covered by the franchise, if the vehicle, parts or accessories are publicly advertised as being available for delivery or actually delivered. Failure caused by acts or causes beyond the control of the manufacturer is not a violation of this act;</p>
                <p>(ii) Refuse to disclose to any new vehicle dealer handling the same line make the manner and mode of distribution of the line make within the relevant market area;</p>
                <p>(iii) Without the consent of the dealer, obtain money, goods, services or other benefit from a person who does business with the new vehicle dealer in relation to the transaction between the new vehicle dealer and the person other than as compensation for services rendered and products provided, unless the benefit is promptly transmitted or credited to the new vehicle dealer;</p>
                <p>(iv) Increase prices of new vehicles ordered by the new vehicle dealer for consumers prior to the new vehicle dealer's receipt of the written official price increase notification. A sales contract signed by a consumer is evidence of each order if the vehicle is delivered to the customer. In the event of manufacturer price reductions or cash rebates paid to the new vehicle dealer intended by the manufacturer to be passed on to the consumer, the amount of any reduction or rebate received by a new vehicle dealer passes to the private retail consumer by the new vehicle dealer. Price reductions apply to all unused, undamaged and unsold vehicles in the dealer's inventory which were subject to the price reduction. Price differences applicable to a new model or series are not a price increase or price decrease. Price changes caused by the following are not subject to this paragraph:</p>
                <p>(A) The addition to a vehicle of required or optional equipment or a change in the capacity, performance, size, weight or design specifications of a vehicle;</p>
                <p>(B) Changes in the rate of exchange of the United States dollar, in the case of foreign-made vehicles or components; and</p>
                <p>(C) An increase in transportation charges due to increased rates imposed by a carrier.</p>
                <p>(v) Release to any other party, except under subpoena or as otherwise required by law or in an administrative, judicial or arbitration proceeding involving the manufacturer or new vehicle dealer, any business, financial, or personal information which is provided by the new vehicle dealer to the manufacturer without the express written consent of the new vehicle dealer;</p>
                <p>(vi) Deny any new vehicle dealer the right of free association with any other new vehicle dealer for any lawful purpose;</p>
                <p>(vii) Unfairly compete with a new vehicle dealer in the same line make and operating under an agreement or franchise from the manufacturer in the relevant market area. A manufacturer is not competing when operating a dealership either temporarily for a reasonable period or in a bona fide retail operation which is for sale to any qualified independent person at a fair and reasonable price, or in a bona fide relationship in which an independent person has made a significant investment subject to loss in the dealership and can reasonably expect to acquire full ownership of such dealership on reasonable terms and conditions;</p>
                <p>(viii) Unfairly discriminate among its new vehicle dealers with respect to warranty reimbursement;</p>
                <p>(ix) Unreasonably withhold consent to the sale, transfer or exchange of the franchise to a qualified buyer capable of being licensed as a new vehicle dealer in this state;</p>
                <p>(x) Fail to respond in writing to a request for consent as specified in paragraph (ix) of this subsection within sixty (60) days of receipt of a written request. Failure to respond within the time specified is consent to the request;</p>
                <p>(xi) Prevent or attempt to prevent any new vehicle dealer from changing the executive management control of the new vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer shows the change of executive management will result in executive management or control by a person who is not of good moral character or who does not meet reasonable, preexisting and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business experience standards. This paragraph does not prevent a manufacturer or distributor from withholding consent based upon the prospective buyer's character, automotive experience, capital and other reasonable qualifications for appointment as a dealer, and the effect of the proposed transaction upon competition. If the manufacturer rejects a proposed change in executive management control, written notice of his reasons shall be given to the dealer within sixty (60) days of notice to the manufacturer by the dealer of the proposed change or the change in the executive management of the new vehicle dealer shall be presumptively deemed approved;</p>
                <p>(xii) Terminate, cancel or fail to renew any franchise solely because of the death or incapacity of an owner who is not listed in the franchise as one on whose expertise and abilities the manufacturer relied in granting the franchise;</p>
                <p>(xiii) Prevent or attempt to prevent the new vehicle dealer from receiving the fair market value of the dealership in a sale transaction or from transferring the new vehicle dealership to a spouse or legal heir as specified in this act;</p>
                <p>(xiv) Engage in any predatory practice or discrimination against any new vehicle dealer;</p>
                <p>(xv) Use any false or misleading advertisement in the conduct of his business as a manufacturer or distributor in this state;</p>
                <p>(xvi) Make any false or misleading statement, either directly or through any agent or employee, to induce any new vehicle dealer to enter into any agreement or franchise.</p>
                <p>(d) No manufacturer or any officer, agent or representative shall coerce or attempt to coerce any new vehicle dealer in this state to sell, assign or transfer any retail installment sales contract obtained by the dealer in connection with the sale by him in this state of new vehicles manufactured or sold by the manufacturer to a specified finance company, class of companies or to any other specified person.</p>
                <p>(e) Any statement, threats, promises, acts, contracts or offers of contracts which lessen or eliminate competition or tend to create a monopoly are unfair trade practices, unfair methods of competition and are prohibited.</p>
                <p>(f) No manufacturer or agent or employee of a manufacturer shall use a written instrument, agreement or waiver to attempt to nullify any of the provisions of this section. Any such agreement, written instrument or waiver is null and void.</p>
                <p>(g) No person shall directly or indirectly impose unreasonable restrictions on the new vehicle dealer relative to the sale, transfer, right to renew, termination, discipline, noncompetition covenants, site control (whether by sublease, collateral pledge of lease, or otherwise), right of first refusal to purchase, option to purchase, compliance with subjective standards and assertion of legal or equitable rights.</p>
                <p>(h) This act applies to all written franchise agreements between a manufacturer and a new vehicle dealer, including but not limited to, the franchise offering, the franchise agreement, sales of goods, services or advertising, promises to pay, security interests, pledges, insurance contracts, advertising contracts, construction or installation contracts, servicing contracts and all other agreements where the manufacturer has any direct or indirect interest.</p>
                <p>(j) No motor vehicle manufacturer or distributor licensed under this act, directly or indirectly, shall offer to sell or sell new motor vehicles to a consumer except through a new vehicle dealer who holds a valid sales and service agreement, franchise, or contract granted by the manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler for the sale of its motor vehicles. This subsection shall not apply to a licensed direct sale manufacturer, sales to affiliates of the manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, sales to the federal government, charitable organizations or sales to employees of the manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler.</p>

                <p>(a) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions or conditions of any franchise or waiver, no manufacturer shall cancel, terminate or fail to renew any franchise with a licensee unless the manufacturer has satisfied the notice requirement of subsection</p>
                <p>(b) of this section and has good cause for cancellation, termination or nonrenewal.</p>
                <p>(b) Prior to the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of any franchise, the manufacturer shall furnish notification of termination, cancellation or nonrenewal to the department and the licensee:</p>

                <p>(E) A fraudulent misrepresentation by the new motor vehicle dealer to the manufacturer, which is material to the franchise; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Not less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the effective date of the termination or cancellation, where the manufacturer is discontinuing the sale of the product line.</p>
                <p>(c) Notification under this section shall be in writing, by certified mail or personally delivered to the licensee and shall state the intention to terminate, cancel or not to renew the franchise, reasons for the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal and the date on which the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect.</p>

                <p>(i) Failure by the licensee to comply with a provision of the franchise, which is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship, provided that the dealer has been notified in writing of the failure within one hundred eighty (180) days prior to termination, cancellation or nonrenewal;</p>

                <p>(B) The licensee was afforded a reasonable opportunity, for a period of not less than six (6) months, to comply with the criteria; and</p>
                <p>(C) The licensee did not demonstrate substantial compliance with the performance criteria of the manufacturer during such period.</p>
                <p>(e) Within twenty (20) days of receiving the notice or within twenty (20) days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, the dealer may file with the department to protest the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal.

                <p>(f) The department will select a hearing examiner to conduct a hearing and to render proposed findings of fact. The proposed findings of fact shall be conclusive unless clearly erroneous and unsupported by the record. The hearing shall be conducted and the department shall render its final determination within one hundred twenty (120) days after the manufacturer responds to the licensee's protest. The department may forbid the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of the franchise if it is determined good cause does not exist.</p>
                <p>(g) All costs of the department, including but not limited to, the cost of the investigation, the cost of the hearing examiner and the cost of preparing the record, shall be borne equally by the parties.

                <p>(h) The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof under this section.</p>
                <p>(j) Upon the termination, nonrenewal or cancellation of any franchise by the manufacturer pursuant to this section, the licensee shall be allowed fair and reasonable compensation by the manufacturer for the:</p>

                <p>(k) Fair and reasonable compensation under subsection (j) of this section shall be paid or credited by the manufacturer within ninety (90) days of the tender of the property, provided the licensee has clear title to the inventory and other items and is in a position to convey that title to the manufacturer.</p>
                <p>(m) In the event of a termination, cancellation or nonrenewal by the manufacturer under this section, except as provided in subparagraph (b)(ii)(C) of this section, the manufacturer shall pay:</p>
                <p>(i) A sum equivalent to rent of the unexpired term of the lease or one (1) year rent based upon reasonable rental value, whichever is less, if the motor vehicle dealer is leasing its motor vehicle dealership facility from a lessor other than manufacturers or distributors; or</p>
                <p>(ii) A sum equivalent to reasonable rental value of the dealership facility for one (1) year or the reasonable rental value of the facility until facilities are leased or sold, whichever is less, if the motor vehicle dealer owns the motor vehicle dealer facility.</p>
                <p>(n) The rental payment required under subsection (m) of this section is only required to the extent that the facilities were used for the sale and service of the manufacturer's or distributor's product, and only to the extent they are not leased for other purposes. Payment under subsection (k) of this section entitles the manufacturer or distributor to possession and use of the facility.</p>
                <p>(o) This section shall not relieve a new motor vehicle dealer, lessor or other owner of an established place of business from the obligation to mitigate damages.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>31-16-110. Succession to franchise ownership.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions or conditions of any franchise:</p>
                <p>(i) Any owner or a licensee may appoint by will, or any other written instrument, a designated family member to succeed in the ownership interest of the owner in the new vehicle dealer;</p>
                <p>(ii) Unless there exists good cause for refusal to honor succession by the manufacturer, any designated family member of a deceased or incapacitated owner of a new vehicle dealer may succeed to the ownership of the new vehicle dealer under the existing franchise if:</p>
                <p>(A) The designated family member gives the manufacturer written notice of intent to succeed to the ownership of the new vehicle dealer within thirty (30) days of the owner's death or incapacity; and</p>
                <p>(B) The designated family member agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise.</p>
                <p>(iii) The manufacturer may request and the designated family member shall promptly provide personal and financial data reasonably necessary to determine whether the succession should be honored;</p>
                <p>(iv) If a manufacturer believes good cause exists for refusing to honor the succession to the ownership of a new vehicle dealer by a family member of a deceased or incapacitated owner of a new vehicle dealer under the existing franchise agreement, the manufacturer may serve upon the designated family member and the department notice of its refusal to honor the succession and of its intent to discontinue the existing franchise with the dealer no sooner than sixty (60) days from the date the notice is served. The notice may only be served not more than sixty (60) days following receipt of:</p>
                <p>(A) Notice of the designated family member's intent to succeed to the ownership of the new vehicle dealer; or</p>
                <p>(B) Any personal or financial data which it has requested.</p>
                <p>(v) The notice in paragraph (iv) of this subsection shall state the specific grounds for the refusal to honor the succession and of its intent to discontinue the existing franchise with the new vehicle dealer no sooner than sixty (60) days from the date the notice is served;</p>
                <p>(vi) If notice of refusal and discontinuance is not timely served upon the family member, the franchise shall continue in effect subject to termination only as otherwise permitted under this act;</p>
                <p>(vii) Within twenty (20) days of receiving the notice after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, the designated family member may file with the department to protest the refusal to honor the successor. When such a protest is filed, the department shall inform the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed and the manufacturer has sixty (60) days to respond to the protest after actually being informed by the department of the protest. The manufacturer shall not terminate or discontinue the existing franchise until the department has held a hearing under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and determined that there is good cause for not permitting the succession. All hearing costs shall be borne as prescribed under W.S. 31-16-109(g);</p>
                <p>(viii) In determining whether good cause for the refusal to honor the succession exists, the manufacturer or importer has the burden of proof;</p>
                <p>(ix) This act does not preclude the owner of a new vehicle dealer from designating any person as his successor by written instrument filed with the manufacturer. If there is a conflict between the written instrument and this section and the written instrument has not been revoked by the owner of the new dealer in writing to the manufacturer the written instrument shall govern;</p>
                <p>(x) As used in this section, "manufacturer" includes a manufacturer, a distributor, a factory branch, distributor branch or other representative.</p>

                <p>(ii) Growth or decline in population and new motor vehicle registrations in the relevant market area;</p>
                <p>(iii) Effect on the consuming public in the relevant market area;</p>
                <p>(iv) Whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public welfare for an additional new vehicle dealer to be established;</p>
                <p>(v) Whether the new vehicle dealers of the same line make in that relevant market area are providing adequate competition and convenient customer care for the vehicles of the line make in the market area, including the adequacy of vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of vehicle parts and qualified service personnel;</p>
                <p>(vi) Whether the establishment of an additional new vehicle dealer would increase competition and be in the public interest.</p>
                <p>(d) The protesting new vehicle dealer shall have the burden of establishing that good cause does not exist for the establishment of an additional new vehicle dealer or the relocation of an existing new vehicle dealer.</p>

                <p>(ii) If the dealer applied for a new dealer license, he may purchase demo plates in the same amount specified in paragraph (i) of this subsection, except authorization to purchase demo license plates shall be based on the dealer's reasonable estimate of the number of retail vehicle sales the dealer will make during the first year of business. The department may revise the estimate and reduce or increase the number of demo license plates authorized under this paragraph at any time, but not less than ninety (90) days after the certificate is issued if, from the number of retail sales made, it appears the estimate is substantially inaccurate.

                <p>(f) Licensed Wyoming based manufacturers may apply to the department for one (1) or more manufacturer license plates, or, if the department authorizes, to the county treasurer in a county where the manufacturer has an established place of business.

                  <p>(i) In the case of a Wyoming based commercial vehicle or fleet, or a commercial vehicle or fleet based in a jurisdiction permitting proportional registration of similar Wyoming based commercial vehicles or fleets which will be operated under intrastate for hire operating authority granted by the department, except trailers, divide instate miles by total miles and multiply times the county fee prescribed by W.S. 31-18-401(a)(i) and the state fee prescribed by W.S. 31-18-401(a)(ii), and an additional fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) to the counties for each vehicle to be registered;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (iii) of this subsection, in the case of a commercial vehicle or fleet based in a jurisdiction permitting proportional registration of similar Wyoming based commercial vehicles or fleets which will not require intrastate for hire operating authority from the department, divide instate miles by total miles and multiply times the equalized highway use tax prescribed by W.S. 31-18-401(a)(iii) and the state fee prescribed by W.S. 31-18-401(a)(ii) for each vehicle to be registered;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection and W.S. 31-18-401(a)(iii) an owner of a commercial vehicle as defined in paragraph (ii) of this subsection may file an application with the department prior to January 1 of the year in which registration is due requesting payment of the proportioned county fee in lieu of the equalized highway use tax prescribed in W.S. 31-18-401(a)(iii). The department shall authorize the taxpayer to pay the lesser of the county registration fee prescribed in W.S. 31-18-401(a)(i) times instate miles divided by total miles or the equalized highway use tax if the department receives the information which is necessary to calculate the county fee and the equalized highway use tax prior to the time prescribed by this paragraph. The department shall notify the taxpayer of the amount due under this paragraph within thirty (30) days of the date the necessary information is received. The taxpayer shall pay the amount due as determined by the department pursuant to this paragraph prior to April 1 of the year in which registration is due. Fees collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be distributed to the state highway fund.</p>
                  <p>(e) Every owner engaged in the business of renting utility trailers shall register a number of trailers equal to the average number of utility trailers rented in or through Wyoming during the preceding year. Thereafter, all utility trailers rented or leased by the owner and properly identified and licensed in any jurisdiction may operate in Wyoming on an interstate and intrastate basis. The owner shall submit verifiable data to the department as to the average number of trailers rented or operated in Wyoming during the preceding year and such other information as may be required by the department. All applicable fees shall be paid to and, if necessary, license plates issued by the department.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed by Laws 2009, Ch. 128, ยง 4.</p>
                  <p>(g) Every owner engaged in the business of renting rental trucks less than twenty-six thousand (26,000) pounds gross weight operated as part of an identifiable one-way fleet shall register a number of rental trucks equal to instate miles divided by total miles times the number of rental vehicles in the fleet. Thereafter, all fleet rental trucks may operate in Wyoming on an interstate and intrastate basis. The owner shall submit verifiable data and pay applicable fees to the department. The department shall issue evidence of registration of the fleet.</p>
                  <p>(h) The department may enter into agreements relating to proportional registration of commercial vehicles with authorities of one (1) or more jurisdictions to facilitate administration. Every agreement shall be in writing and filed in the office of the secretary of state. Every agreement shall contain a provision authorizing the department to cancel and revoke the agreement with respect to Wyoming upon thirty (30) days notice to other parties thereto. Agreements shall provide for the submission of an application containing the information required by subsection (c) of this section to the department in the case of Wyoming based commercial vehicles and to the department or an authorized agency in another jurisdiction, in the case of non-Wyoming based commercial vehicles. As used in this subsection "commercial vehicle" includes utility trailers, rental vehicles and rental trucks.</p>
                  <p>(j) Agreements may also provide for the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Full reciprocity for non-Wyoming based commercial vehicles operated solely in interstate commerce of specified types, or gross or unladen weights, in exchange for equivalent reciprocity for Wyoming based commercial carriers;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Reciprocal audits of records of owners or commercial vehicles by jurisdictions parties to the agreement;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A definition of "fleet" which varies from W.S. 31-1-101(a)(vi);</p>
                  <p>(iv) Such other matters which will facilitate the administration of the agreement, including exchange of information for audits and enforcement activity and collection and disbursement of proportioned registration fees for other jurisdictions in the case of Wyoming based commercial vehicles.</p>
                  <p>(k) Upon application and payment of fees as prescribed by subsection (d) of this section, the department shall register commercial vehicles and in the case of Wyoming based commercial carriers issue distinctive Wyoming license plates. In the case of non-Wyoming based commercial vehicles the department may issue distinctive Wyoming license plates, distinctive stickers, or other suitable visual identification devices in such form as prescribed by the department which shall be affixed to the vehicle as required by the department. The department may also issue a registration card for each vehicle registered identifying the vehicle which shall be carried in the vehicle at all times. The department shall cancel, revoke, suspend or refuse to issue the registrations provided by this section based upon a finding from its records and prior experience that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The operation or equipment used renders the highways unsafe;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Delinquent fees are due and payable to the department; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The permittee has not complied with or continues to not comply with all laws and applicable rules and regulations of this act or governing the operations of interstate motor carriers as defined by law.</p>
                  <p>(m) Commercial vehicles or fleets registered as provided by this section are fully licensed and registered in Wyoming for any type of movement or operation excluding those instances in which a grant of authority is required for intrastate movement or operation in which case no vehicle shall be operated in intrastate commerce unless the owner or operator has intrastate authority or rights from the department.</p>
                  <p>(n) If the department determines that mileage records or mileage estimates of any owner are not satisfactory for the purpose of registration under this section, the department may prescribe or permit an alternate method designed to present a more accurate representation of the proportion of the preceding year to be ascribed to the owner's commercial vehicle or fleet in substitution for the quotient prescribed by subsection (d) of this section. If the department determines that the quotient used for the preceding registration year varies substantially from the quotient submitted for the registration year under application, the department may recompute the quotient for the preceding registration year on the basis of information contained in the application or from the applicant's records or from such other information as it may have available to it and charge such additional fees as may be required by the redetermined quotient.</p>
                  <p>(o) Vehicles acquired by an owner after the commencement of the registration year and subsequently added to a proportionally registered fleet shall be proportionally registered by applying the mileage percentage used in the original application for the fleet for the registration period to the fees otherwise due with respect to the vehicle for the remainder of the registration year. This subsection does not apply to any commercial vehicle operated by the owner as a lessee of another owner who has in the registration year proportionally registered the vehicle in Wyoming if the lessor establishes to the satisfaction of the department that he maintains and will submit complete annual mileage data for the vehicle for all jurisdictions, including, by individual jurisdictions, all miles operated in service by the lessor and his lessee and that the vehicle or its replacement will, in the normal course of operations, be included in the lessor's proportional registration application in Wyoming for the succeeding license year.</p>
                  <p>(p) If a commercial vehicle is withdrawn from a proportionally registered fleet during any registration year the owner shall so notify the department. The department shall require the owner to surrender proportional registration cards and such other identification devices which have been issued with respect to the vehicle. If a vehicle is permanently withdrawn from a proportionally registered fleet because it has been destroyed, sold or otherwise completely removed from the service of the owner the unused portion of the registration fee paid with respect to the vehicle, which is a sum equal to the amount of registration fee paid with respect to the vehicle for the registration year reduced by one twelfth (1/12) for each calendar month and fraction elapsing between the first day of the month of the registration year and the date the notice of withdrawal is received by the department, shall be credited to the proportional registration account of the owner. The credit shall be applied against liability for subsequent additions to be prorated during the registration year. If the credit is less than five dollars ($5.00) per vehicle withdrawn no credit shall be made or entered. In no event shall the amount be credited against fees other than those for the registration year nor is any amount subject to refund.</p>
                  <p>(q) Any owner registering a vehicle pursuant to this section shall preserve the records on which the application is based for three (3) years following the registration year for which registration was permitted. Upon request of the department, the owner shall make his records available during reasonable business hours for audit as to accuracy of computations, payments and assessment of deficiencies or allowances for credit. The department may enter into agreements with agencies of other jurisdictions administering motor vehicle registration laws for reciprocal audits of the records of any owner. Audits performed by agencies of other jurisdictions may be accepted and utilized by the department in the same manner as if the audit had been performed by personnel of the department.</p>
                  <p>(r) Any sums found to be due and owing upon audit bear interest of one and three-quarters percent (1.75%) per month from the date when they should have been paid until the date of actual payment. If the audit discloses a deliberate and willful intent to evade the requirements of this section, an additional penalty of one percent (1%) per month of sums found to be due and owing on audit from the date when they should have been paid shall be also assessed.</p>
                  <p>(s) Except as otherwise provided in this section, owners of commercial vehicles meeting the registration requirements of another jurisdiction and subject to registration in Wyoming and not entitled to exemption from registration or licensing under this section may, as an alternative to registration or proportional registration secure a temporary permit from the department to make a single trip into, within or out of Wyoming for a period of not to exceed ninety-six (96) hours for a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) for each single unit operated as a single unit or forty dollars ($40.00) for each legal combination of units including only one (1) power unit. In lieu of the fee required by W.S. 39-17-106(g) or 39-17-206(d) for license and taxation of gasoline or diesel fuels the operator may secure a temporary permit from the department to operate in Wyoming for a period of not to exceed ninety-six (96) hours for a fee of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) for each single unit operated as a single unit or fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each legal combination of units including only one (1) power unit.</p>
                  <p>(t) An owner of a commercial vehicle engaged in the motion picture industry whose vehicle is properly registered in another state and not entitled to the registration or licensing exemption under W.S. 31-2-224 or this section may, as an alternative to registration or proportional registration and in lieu of the fee required by W.S. 39-17-106(g) and 39-17-206(d), apply to the department for a temporary permit to operate the vehicle in Wyoming for ninety (90) days upon payment of the appropriate fees prescribed in subsection (s) of this section. As used in this subsection, "motion picture industry" includes all filming in this state for commercial purposes including advertising. Any person operating a vehicle in Wyoming beyond the period authorized in the temporary permit is subject to a civil penalty requiring full registration of the vehicle in Wyoming for the registration year in which the violation occurred and payment of all fees required for registration.</p>
                  <p>(u) Any person legally engaged in the transportation of new vehicles over the highways of this state from manufacturing or assembly points to agents of manufacturers or dealers in this state or in other states, territories or foreign countries or provinces by the drive away or tow away methods, where the vehicle being driven, towed on its own wheels, or transported by the saddlemount, towbar or full-mount methods, or a lawful combination of these methods, for the purpose of sale, barter or exchange, or for delivery after sale, may annually apply to the department for a permit and a transporter number plate to use the highways of this state and pay a fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the permit and thirty dollars ($30.00) for each transporter number plate. The transporter plate shall be displayed upon the front of the driven vehicle combination or upon the rear of a motor vehicle driven singly or upon the rear of a vehicle being towed. The permit shall be valid for the current year ending December 31. Vehicles may be transported as provided under this subsection while displaying the plate. Transporters who fail to display the plate will be required to obtain a single trip permit from the department pursuant to subsection (s) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(w) An operator of a tour bus may obtain a temporary permit pursuant to subsection (s) of this section. An operator of a mobile drilling rig or well servicing unit operated interstate and which is constructed as a machine consisting in general of a mast, an engine for power and propulsion, a draw works and a chassis permanently constructed or assembled for the vehicle may obtain a single trip permit in accordance with subsection (s) of this section. Mobile drilling rigs or well servicing units making an intrastate move shall be registered in Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(y) A temporary permit issued under this section shall be carried in the power unit. Unlawful use of the temporary permit or fraudulent or false information given to obtain the temporary permit invalidates the permit and results in the penalty provided by W.S. 31-18-701. The department shall cancel, revoke, suspend or refuse to issue the temporary permits provided by this section based upon a finding from its records and prior experience that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The operation or equipment used renders the highways unsafe;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Delinquent fees are due and payable to the department; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The permittee has not complied with or continues to not comply with all laws and applicable rules and regulations of this act or governing the operations of interstate motor carriers as defined by law.</p>
                  <p>(z) The following vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) Vehicles granted reciprocity pursuant to W.S. 31-</p>
                  <p>2-203;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The following vehicles if validly registered in states contiguous to Wyoming if the contiguous states grant similar exemptions to Wyoming owners of like vehicles:</p>
                  <p>(A) Wreckers or service cars when towing or hauling other vehicles for emergency repairs;</p>
                  <p>(B) Trucks, or permissible combinations of trucks and trailers, when being used by any farmer or rancher for the transportation of livestock, feed or unprocessed agricultural products owned and produced by the farmer or rancher of production to market, and of farm and ranch supplies solely intended for the use of the farmer or rancher, and not for sale, when being transported on the return trip.</p>

                  <p>(a) Owners or operators of mobile machinery required to be registered under W.S. 31-18-203 through 31-18-208 shall apply to a county treasurer in this state annually and pay a registration fee in lieu of property taxes as provided in subsection (e) of this section. For mobile machinery registered after February 1 in any year, the fee shall be computed by multiplying the fee under subsection (e) of this section times the number of full months remaining in the calendar year and dividing by twelve (12). County treasurers shall distribute fees collected under this subsection in the same manner and proportion as property taxes.</p>
                  <p>(b) County treasurers shall issue stickers and certificates of registration to owners of mobile machinery registered under this section. The sticker shall be displayed on the mobile machinery for which it was issued so as to be visible by a person not operating the mobile machinery.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department shall prescribe application forms and the form of stickers and certificates of registration issued under this section and provide them without charge to each county treasurer. The department shall furnish stickers and a "mobile machinery register" to each county treasurer in a similar manner as a vehicle register is provided under W.S. 31-2-213. The department may promulgate rules necessary to implement this act.</p>
                  <p>(d) The registration of mobile machinery expires ten (10) days after its transfer unless the original owner files an application for a transfer of ownership accompanied by the fees based on the amount which would be due on a new registration as of the date of transfer less any credit for the unused portion of the original registration fees for the original registration for the mobile machinery and an additional fee of six dollars ($6.00) with a county treasurer. Upon receipt of a completed application and the required fee, the county treasurer shall issue the new owner a new certificate of registration. The fee collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the county general fund.</p>
                  <p>(e) The fee for mobile machinery shall be computed by multiplying the statewide average county, school district and state property tax mill levy for the preceding year as computed by the state board of equalization times the applicable assessment factor times the valuation of the mobile machinery. The department of revenue shall establish schedules for valuation of mobile machinery for use by county treasurers.</p>

                  <p>(a) In lieu of registration under W.S. 31-18-205, a non- Wyoming based owner or operator of mobile machinery may apply for a temporary registration sticker valid for not more than eleven (11) months, providing the temporary registration sticker shall not extend in to the next calendar year, from either a county treasurer or the department. The owner or operator shall present sufficient documentation to allow the county treasurer or the department to establish the valuation of the mobile machinery. The fee for the authority to use and display the temporary sticker shall be computed by multiplying the fee under W.S. 31-18-205(e) times the number of months requested in the calendar year and dividing by twelve (12), plus an administrative fee of ten dollars ($10.00) and six dollars ($6.00) for the sticker.</p>
                  <p>(b) The fees for mobile machinery collected by the county treasurer under this section shall be distributed in the same manner and proportion as property taxes. The fees for mobile machinery collected by the department under this section shall be distributed in the same manner as fees for non-Wyoming based commercial vehicles under W.S. 31-3-103(a). Administrative fees collected by the county treasurer shall be deposited in the county general fund, and those collected by the department shall be deposited in the highway fund.</p>
                  <p>(c) The sticker issued under this section shall be displayed on the mobile machinery in the same manner as stickers issued under W.S. 31-18-205.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>31-18-207. Rental or leased machinery.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) In lieu of payment of the registration fee under W.S. 31-18-205, the owner of any mobile machinery who is regularly engaged in the sale, rental or both sale and rental of mobile machinery and who rents or leases mobile machinery to another individual or corporation in which the owner has no interest for one (1) or more periods of at least sixty (60) days in any calendar year may elect to pay a registration fee under this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Authorization for payment of registration fees under this section shall be obtained from the county treasurer in the county in which the owner's principal place of business is located. The owner shall also apply for an identifying decal for each item of mobile machinery to be rented or leased. The identifying decal shall be affixed to the item of mobile machinery at the time it is rented or leased. The owner shall keep records of each decal issued and a description of the item of mobile machinery to which it is affixed. The fee for each identifying decal is six dollars ($6.00), and payment shall be made at the time of application to the county treasurer. Decals expire at the end of each calendar year, and application for new decals shall be made for each calendar year or portion thereof. The owner shall remove any identifying decal upon the sale or change of ownership of mobile machinery. The fee collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the county general fund.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon receiving authorization under subsection (b) of this section, the owner shall collect from the user a registration fee in the amount equivalent to one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the amount of the rental or lease payment. No later than the twentieth day of the January following, the owner shall submit a calendar year report, using forms which shall be furnished by the department of revenue, to the county treasurer in which the mobile machinery is used, together with the remittance for all taxes collected for the preceding calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(d) Reports shall be made even if no registration fees were collected by the owner in the previous calendar year. Failure to make reports for sixty (60) days is grounds for termination of the owner's right to pay fees under this section. If the owner has failed to remit fees received from a renter or lessee during the sixty (60) day period, the county treasurer may proceed to collect these delinquent fees in the manner provided for collection of delinquent taxes under W.S. 39-13-108(e)(i)(A).</p>
                  <p>(e) The department of revenue shall promulgate rules and regulations for the administration and enforcement of this section.</p>

Investigators, troopers and authorized personnel may compel the driver to stop and submit the vehicle to an inspection by signs directing commercial vehicles or the motor carrier to stop at ports of entry or other locations designated by the department or by warning devices on vehicles of investigators, troopers or authorized personnel. All ports of entry shall post signs or signals indicating when the facility is open and directing commercial vehicles or motor carriers to stop for inspection. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a vehicle that is properly registered, has a proper fuel license, valid authority and is legal in size and weight, upon approval by the department, may be authorized to bypass a port of entry unless specifically directed to stop by an investigator, trooper or authorized personnel or by a sign or signal specifically requiring those vehicles to stop. These vehicles may, however, be required to slow to the designated speed and use the directed traffic lane for size and weight screening purposes.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>31-18-804. Permits for and certain highways to carry, overweight and oversize vehicles; government vehicles.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The director or his authorized representative may issue permits for separate movements or extended periods of movement effective for one (1) or more months, not to exceed ninety (90) days permitting hauling of forest products, baled hay or combine headers. No permit issued under this section shall be granted for any load of forest products exceeding one hundred twelve (112) inches in width or any load of baled hay or combine headers exceeding one hundred fifty (150) inches in width and fifteen (15) feet in height. No single component of the load may exceed one hundred two (102) inches in width. The fee for a single trip permit is fifteen dollars ($15.00). The fee for an extended period permit is fifty dollars ($50.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) The director or his authorized representative may issue a permit exclusive of interstate highways for hauling of forest products, sugar beets, gravel, livestock and agricultural products hauled in trucks that cannot be weighed at point of loading at a weight which is not more than ten percent (10%) in excess of allowable axle weights and not more than five thousand (5,000) pounds in excess of gross weights allowed under gross weight Table I. The permit fee is fifteen dollars ($15.00) for a single trip permit not to exceed ninety-six (96) continuous hours. The permit fee is fifty dollars ($50.00) for any ninety (90) continuous days. If a truck hauling forest products, sugar beets, gravel, livestock or agricultural products exceeds the legal weight limitations, the truck shall be allowed to unload at its point of destination in this state if the point of destination is within one (1) mile of the truck's location when the illegal weight limitation was determined, unless an immediate threat to public safety exists. No penalty for the first violation shall be imposed, but any subsequent violation shall be subject to the penalty provisions of W.S. 31-18-805.</p>
                  <p>(c) In special circumstances of individual movements of vehicles hauling single, multiple or readily divisible items which cannot be readily or safely dismantled or divided or which cannot be transported safely or without damage when dismantled or divided, the director or his authorized representative may upon application and good cause shown issue a permit in writing effective for a single trip by each permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a width, height, length or weight of vehicle or load, exceeding the maximum specified in or authorized under W.S. 31-18-802.</p>
                  <p>(d) For movements of a vehicle without load, or meeting indivisible load requirements, or a trailer carrying a recreational boat that exceeds any maximum dimension or weight authorized under W.S. 31-18-802, the director or his authorized representative may upon application issue a permit in writing effective for an extended period of time, not to exceed one (1) year, authorizing the movement of the vehicle, provided that the size does not exceed seventy-five (75) feet in length for a single vehicle and twelve (12) feet in width or fifteen (15) feet in height for a single vehicle or combination of vehicles. The permit fee for an oversize vehicle is fifty dollars ($50.00). The director or his authorized representative may upon application issue a permit effective for one (1) year, authorizing the commercial movement of one (1) or more motor homes, house trailers or truck campers that exceed the maximum width authorized under W.S. 31-18-802(a)(i)(A). A copy of the permit shall be carried with the vehicle. The fee for such a permit shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). Notwithstanding subsections (e) through (t) of this section, no additional permit requirements shall be imposed upon the commercial movement of such vehicles if such vehicles comply with W.S. 31-18-802(a)(i)(A). The permit fee for an overweight vehicle is as prescribed in subsection (g) of this section. Extended period permits are not authorized for transportable homes as defined in W.S. 31-1-101.</p>
                  <p>(e) The application for any permit under this section shall specifically describe the applicant, individual or company, the vehicle or load to be operated or moved, and the particular highway to be used and whether the permit is requested for a single trip or for extended period operation. Each permit shall contain the following provisions: duration of permit, description of load or loads to be moved, section standards which are to be exceeded and the amount of excess authorized, description of equipment, route to be traveled and required operating procedures. Every permit issued under this act shall be carried with the vehicles or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any authorized agent of the state of Wyoming. Permission may be verbally issued by telephone or otherwise, granting the applicant authorization to proceed to the nearest permit issuing facility to be weighed and measured and to obtain the permit.</p>
                  <p>Unless otherwise authorized by the director or his authorized representative, permits shall be obtained prior to operating any oversize or overweight vehicles on the highways of this state.</p>
                  <p>Nothing herein contained shall be construed to permit a vehicle that is overweight or oversize and has not obtained a permit or permission in advance to be operated on the highways of this state. Except as provided in W.S. 31-18-805(b) and this subsection, the operator shall be required to unload the excess weight, reduce the excess size or otherwise bring the load within permissible limits and pay all fees for overweight or oversize under this act for distance traveled in addition to penalties provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(f) When an oversize single trip permit is issued, the fee is twenty-five dollars ($25.00). Should any vehicle including load exceed the dimensions of fifteen (15) feet in width or fifteen (15) feet in height or any single vehicle including load exceed seventy-five (75) feet in length, an additional fee shall be paid in excess of the above limitation computed at the rate of three cents ($.03) for each foot or fraction thereof for each mile traveled on the highways.</p>
                  <p>(g) When an overweight permit is issued, the fee is six cents ($.06) for each ton or fraction thereof of weight in excess of the weight limitation under W.S. 31-18-802 for each mile traveled on the highways. In no event shall the fee be less than forty dollars ($40.00) for the permit. A permit under this section for loads exceeding eighty (80) tons shall not be issued until the permittee has paid all costs incurred by the state to determine routing, structure, highway capability to withstand the load and the cost incurred by sending personnel to accompany the movement of the load.</p>
                  <p>(h) In addition to other permits authorized in this act, the director may issue permits to be completed by the applicant.</p>
                  <p>These permits shall authorize separate movements of items that cannot be readily dismantled or divided, or safely transported if dismantled or divided. The applicant is required to complete a separate permit prior to each separate movement. The fee for the permit is that established in subsections (f) and (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(j) The director may promulgate rules and regulations as to the terms and conditions of the permits issued under this article. Alteration of any word or figure on the face of a permit will void the permit immediately and will subject the permit to confiscation by the inspecting officer.</p>
                  <p>(k) The funds paid for permits for the use of highways shall be credited to the state highway fund.</p>
                  <p>(m) Permits issued under this act shall be issued under conditions deemed necessary for travel safety and highway system protection as to time of day and day of week, route, equipment, speed and otherwise as may be determined by the director or his authorized representative.</p>
                  <p>(n) Certain highways may be designated to carry vehicles of greater weight, size and number of vehicles than given in this article if it has been determined by the governor or director that a situation of economic hardship exists or that the general welfare of the state of Wyoming or another state would benefit from the designation. Vehicles operating on the designated highways shall obtain a permit under this section in accordance with rules adopted by the director. Provisions for the designation may be made if the director has determined:</p>
                  <p>(i) That the operation of the vehicles under this subsection would relieve a situation that is detrimental to the economy or general welfare of the state or another state; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) By engineering evaluation that the highways and bridges in question have geometrical and structural capacity adequate to accommodate the vehicles and allow their operation safely and compatibly with other traffic on the highways; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) That federal highway funds will not be withdrawn by this provision.</p>
                  <p>(o) The director or his authorized representative is authorized to examine and audit the records of any person having applied for and having received overweight and oversize permits to determine the accuracy of these permits and reports, or to determine fees due in the event no report is made. The records shall not be destroyed for a period of two (2) years or until the records have been examined and audited, whichever occurs first.</p>
                  <p>(p) In determining permit weights of vehicles or combinations of vehicles, a variable load suspension axle may be counted as load bearing, provided that the variable load suspension axle that is capable of producing a distribution of weight to prevent an axle or axle group from exceeding maximum allowable weights in accordance with department rules and regulations.</p>
                  <p>(q) Multiple piece loads of a size or weight greater than that authorized in W.S. 31-18-802 are prohibited except as authorized in this section.</p>
                  <p>(r) Oversize vehicles with a proper permit may be used to transport loads of legal size, legal weight, oversize indivisible loads or overweight indivisible loads.</p>
                  <p>(s) Vehicles owned and operated by government agencies shall comply with the provisions of this article and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this article, except that no permit shall be required for oversize or overweight movements made in compliance with this section.</p>
                  <p>(t) The director or his authorized representative may issue permits for vehicles at weights in excess of limits allowed in W.S. 31-18-802(a)(vi), but meeting axle and bridge formula specifications in section 127 of title 23, United States Code and pursuant to section 335 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (104 Stat. 2186) and sections 1023(d)(I)(A) and (1)(B) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Permit fees for vehicles operating under this provision shall be paid in accordance with rules adopted by the director or his authorized representative and shall be credited to the highway fund. A power unit receiving a permit under this subsection shall be capable of maintaining a speed of twenty-five (25) miles per hour on a grade of five percent (5%) or less when fully loaded.</p>
                  <p>(u) Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to authorize the operation of triple trailers as prohibited by W.S. 31-5-1009.</p>

                  <p>(a) Rental companies engaged in the business of renting rental vehicles for periods of thirty-one (31) days or less shall collect, at the time the vehicle is rented in Wyoming, a four percent (4%) surcharge on each rental vehicle contract. For purposes of this chapter, a vehicle is rented in Wyoming if possession is obtained by the renter in Wyoming. The surcharge shall be computed on the total dollar amount stated in the rental contract, except that taxes imposed by chapters 15 and 16 of title 39 shall not be used in computing the surcharge. The surcharge paid under this section shall not be subject to the taxes imposed by chapters 15 and 16 of title 39.</p>
                  <p>(b) The surcharge shall be noted in the rental contract and collected in accordance with the terms of the contract. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the surcharge shall be retained by the rental vehicle agency as reimbursement for any registration fees paid under W.S. 31-3-101.</p>
                  <p>(c) Every rental vehicle agency which collects surcharges pursuant to this section shall file a report with the department on a semiannual basis stating the total amount of registration fees paid in Wyoming on its rental vehicle fleet for the report period, the total amount of rental revenues earned on rentals in Wyoming for the report period and the amount by which the total amount of surcharges collected for the report period exceeds the total amount of Wyoming registration fees paid on the rental vehicle fleet for the reporting period. The surcharge report for the report period of January through June shall be filed no later than July 31, and the surcharge report for the report period of July through December shall be filed no later than January 31 of the following calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(d) Every rental vehicle agency shall include a detailed report of all Wyoming registrations purchased for their rental vehicle fleet which shall include the make, model, year, vehicle identification number, name to which registration was issued, registration number and Wyoming registration fees paid. With each surcharge report, u-drive-it rental vehicle agencies with apportioned registration in another state shall file a detailed report stating the international registration plan account number and dollar amount of registration fees paid to the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(e) All surcharge revenues collected during the preceding calendar year in excess of the total amount of Wyoming registration fees paid on the rental vehicle fleet shall be remitted to the department with the July through December surcharge report, no later than January 31 of the following calendar year, for distribution in accordance with W.S. 31-3-103. For a period of three (3) years after filing the report required under this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) The rental vehicle agency shall retain copies of all rental contracts;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The department may require rental vehicle agencies to furnish copies of rental contracts for purposes of ensuring compliance with this section; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The rental vehicle agency shall provide other information as required by the department for enforcement of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(f) If any person fails or refuses to file a four percent (4%) surcharge remittal report or remit the required surcharge fees, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the surcharge fees due or ten dollars ($10.00) for each month delinquent up to a maximum penalty of one hundred percent (100%) of the surcharge fees due or one hundred dollars ($100.00), whichever is greater, shall be added to the amount due for the delinquent reporting period. The department shall notify the delinquent rental vehicle agency of the total amount due by providing written notice to the agency's established place of business, as shown on the records of the department, either by hand delivery or by United States mail. The rental vehicle agency shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice to submit any delinquent four percent (4%) surcharge remittal report and remit any surcharge fees, interest and penalties due. If the delinquent rental vehicle agency proves to the department that the delinquency was due to a reasonable cause, the department shall waive the penalty provided in this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(g) All delinquent surcharge fees shall be subject to a one percent (1%) per month interest charge which shall be disclosed to the rental vehicle agency in the written notice required by subsection (f) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) The department may require bonds under this chapter as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) A bond equal to the greater of the sum of twenty- five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the dollar amount in which the agency is delinquent in submitting surcharges, whichever is greater, when a rental vehicle agency:</p>
                  <p>(A) Operates without a valid rental vehicle agency certificate;</p>
                  <p>(B) Is delinquent in filing any four percent (4%) surcharge remittal report;</p>
                  <p>(C) Is delinquent in remitting any surcharge fees;</p>
                  <p>(D) Applies for reissuance of a rental agency certificate after the rental agency certificate has been revoked; or</p>
                  <p>(E) Applies for a new or renewal rental agency certificate after violating any provision of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The bond shall be executed with a corporate surety duly licensed to do business in this state. In lieu of a corporate surety bond, the department may accept a cash bond made payable to the department. Any interest earned on a cash bond shall accrue to the rental vehicle agency. The bond shall comply with all of the following requirements:</p>
                  <p>(A) Be approved as to form by the Wyoming attorney general;</p>
                  <p>(B) Be made payable to the department;</p>
                  <p>(C) Guarantee payment of delinquent surcharge fees due under this article and the return of the rental vehicle agency certificates issued under this article.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department shall require a bond from any rental vehicle agency whose certificate has been revoked or who violates any provision of this chapter, as a condition of future licensing. The department may waive any bond requirement imposed when a rental vehicle agency complies with all requirements of this chapter for three (3) consecutive years;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Failure to post a bond required by the department under this section shall result in the denial of a rental vehicle agency certificate.</p>
                  <p>(j) Any person failing to remit the four percent (4%) surcharge fee required by this section is liable for double the amount due, plus interest, penalties and attorney's fees. Upon application made by the state and without requiring a bond, an injunction may be issued against the defendants enjoining and restraining them from renting or offering for rent any rental vehicles in the state until all amounts due are paid. Upon application made by the state, a receiver of the property and business of the defendant may be appointed to impound the same as security for all amounts due.</p>

                <p>(a) Insurers that write automobile insurance in Wyoming may exclude any and all coverage afforded under the policy issued to an owner or operator of a transportation network company vehicle for any loss or injury that occurs while a driver is available to receive a request for a prearranged ride or while a driver is engaged in a prearranged ride.

                <p>(v) Collision coverage.</p>
                <p>(b) Subsection (a) of this section shall apply notwithstanding any requirement under W.S. 31-9-405. Nothing in this section implies or requires that a personal automobile insurance policy provide coverage while a driver is available to receive a request for a prearranged ride, while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride or while the driver otherwise uses a transportation network company vehicle to transport riders for compensation.</p>
                <p>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as to require an insurer to use any particular policy language or reference to this section in order to exclude any and all coverage for any loss or injury that occurs while a driver is available to receive a request for a prearranged ride or while a driver provides a prearranged ride.</p>
                <p>(d) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude an insurer from providing primary or excess coverage for the driver's transportation network company vehicle, if it chooses to do so by contract or endorsement.</p>
                <p>(e) Automobile insurers that exclude the coverage described in W.S. 31-20-107 shall have no duty to defend or indemnify any claim expressly excluded thereunder. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to invalidate or limit an exclusion contained in a policy including any policy in use in Wyoming prior to the enactment of this chapter that excludes coverage for vehicles used to carry persons or property for a charge or which are available for hire by the public. An automobile insurer that defends or indemnifies a claim against a driver that is excluded under the terms of its policy shall have a right of contribution against other insurers that provide automobile insurance to the same driver in satisfaction of the coverage requirements of W.S. 31-20-107.</p>

                <p>(a) A driver shall be an independent contractor, not subject to the Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act and not an employee of a transportation network company if:</p>

                <p>(e) Nothing in this chapter limits the ability of a public airport or its governing body to enter into an operating agreement with a transportation network company providing access to that public airport.
