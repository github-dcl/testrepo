                  <p>(a) For the purpose of determining financial condition, ability to fulfill and manner of fulfillment of its obligations, the nature of its operations and compliance with law, the commissioner or any of his examiners may examine any insurer as often as he, in his sole discretion, deems advisable. He shall examine each insurer licensed in this state not less frequently than every five (5) years. Examination of a reciprocal insurer may include examination of its attorney-in-fact as to its transactions relating to the insurer. Examination of an alien insurer may be limited to its insurance transactions and affairs in the United States, except as the commissioner otherwise requires. In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of the examinations the commissioner shall consider such matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public accountants and other criteria as set forth in the Examiners' Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner shall in like manner examine each insurer applying for an initial certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state.</p>
                  <p>(c) Repealed by Laws 1992, ch. 59, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(d) In lieu of making his own examination of any foreign or alien insurer licensed in this state, the commissioner may accept an examination report on the company as prepared by the insurance department for the company's state of domicile or port of entry state until January 1, 1994. Thereafter, such reports may only be accepted if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The insurance department preparing the report was, at the time of the examination, accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' financial regulation standards and accreditation program; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The examination is performed under the supervision of an accredited insurance department or with the participation of one (1) or more examiners who are employed by an accredited insurance department and who, after the review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department.</p>

                  <p>(i) Who is or holds himself out to be an insurance agent, broker, general agent, adjuster or insurer representative;</p>

                  <p>(iii) Holding the shares of voting stock or the policyholder proxies of a domestic insurer, for the purpose of controlling the management thereof, as voting trustee or otherwise;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Engaged in or in any way involved or proposing to be involved in this state in the promotion, formation or financing of an insurer or insurance holding corporation, or corporation or other group to finance an insurer or the production of its business.</p>

                  <p>(a) Each examination shall be expeditious, fair and impartial. Upon determining that an examination should be conducted the commissioner or his designee shall issue an examination warrant appointing one (1) or more examiners to perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the examination the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the Examiners' Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The commissioner may also employ other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner deems appropriate. No examiner may be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary interest in any person subject to examination under this act. This subsection shall not be construed to automatically preclude an examiner from being:</p>
                  <p>(i) A policyholder or claimant under an insurance policy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A grantor of a mortgage or similar instrument on the examiner's residence to a regulated entity if done under customary terms and in the ordinary course of business;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An investment owner in shares of regulated diversified investment companies; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) A settlor or beneficiary of a "blind trust" into which any otherwise impermissible holdings have been placed.</p>
                  <p>(b) For purposes of completing an examination of any insurer under this act, the commissioner may examine or investigate any person, or the business of any person, if in the sole discretion of the commissioner, the examination or investigation is necessary or material to the examination of the insurer.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any insurer or other person being examined and any officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives thereof shall make freely available to the commissioner or his examiners all accounts, computer and other records, documents, files, information, assets and matters in his possession or control relating to the subject of the examination and shall facilitate the examination. The officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives of the insurer or person shall facilitate the examination and aid in the examination so far as it is in their power to do so. The refusal of any insurer, by its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives to submit to examination or to comply with any reasonable written request of the examiners shall be grounds for suspension or refusal of, or nonrenewal of any license or authority held by the insurer to engage in an insurance or other business subject to the commissioner's jurisdiction. Any such proceedings for suspension, revocation or refusal of any license or authority shall be conducted pursuant to W.S. 26-2-125 through 26-2-130.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed by Laws 1993, ch. 134, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(e) Neither the commissioner nor any examiner shall remove any record, account, document, file or other property of the person being examined from the offices or place of that person except with that person's written consent in advance of the removal or pursuant to a court order. This provision does not affect the making and removal of copies or abstracts of any record, account, document or file.</p>
                  <p>(f) When making an examination under W.S. 26-2-116 through 26-2-124, the commissioner may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the reasonable and appropriate cost shall be borne by the insurer which is the subject of the examination. Notwithstanding the conflict of interest provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may retain from time to time, on an individual basis, qualified actuaries, certified public accountants or other similar individuals who are independently practicing their professions, even though the persons may from time to time be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination under this act.</p>
                  <p>(g) Nothing contained in W.S. 26-2-116 through 26-2-124 shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.</p>
                  <p>(h) Nothing contained in W.S. 26-2-116 through 26-2-124 shall be construed to limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or company work papers or other documents, or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action which the commissioner may, in his sole discretion, deem appropriate.</p>

Investigations initiated by the commissioner or his examiners and assistants for the purpose of ascertaining whether an insurer, agent or adjuster has violated any provision of the insurance code are not examinations within the provisions of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The report shall contain only information appearing upon the books, records, documents and papers of or relating to the insurer, its agents or other person or affairs being examined, or ascertained from testimony of its officers, agents or other individuals under oath concerning the affairs of that insurer or person, together with any conclusions and recommendations as may reasonably be warranted by the information.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon receipt of the verified report the commissioner shall transmit the report to the insurer examined, together with a notice which shall afford the insurer examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than thirty (30) days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report. Upon written request by the insurer filed within the thirty (30) day period, the commissioner shall grant a hearing on the report and shall not file the report until after the hearing and after any appropriate modifications to the report.</p>

                  <p>(f) Within thirty (30) days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals or within thirty (30) days after conclusion of a hearing held pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall fully consider and review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any relevant portions of the examiner's work papers and enter an order:</p>
                  <p>(i) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or corrections. If the examination report reveals that the insurer is operating in violation of any law, regulation or prior order of the commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure the violation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data, documentation or information, and refiling pursuant to this section; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Calling for an investigatory hearing with no less than twenty (20) days notice to the company for purposes of obtaining additional documentation, data, information and testimony.</p>
                  <p>(g) All orders entered pursuant to paragraph (f)(i) of this section shall be accompanied by findings and conclusions resulting from the commissioner's consideration and review of the examination report, relevant examiner work papers and any written submissions or rebuttals. Any such order shall be considered a final administrative decision and may be appealed pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and shall be served upon the insurer by certified mail, together with a copy of the adopted examination report. Within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the adopted report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and related orders.</p>
                  <p>(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code any hearing conducted under paragraph (f)(iii) of this section by the commissioner or authorized representative, shall be conducted as a nonadversarial confidential investigatory proceeding as necessary for the resolution of any inconsistencies, discrepancies or disputed issues apparent upon the face of the filed examination report or raised by or as a result of the commissioner's review of relevant work papers or by the written submission or rebuttal of the insurer. The hearing shall proceed expeditiously with discovery by the insurer limited to the examiner's work papers which tend to substantiate any assertions set forth in any written submission or rebuttal. The hearing shall proceed with the commissioner or his representative posing questions to the persons subpoenaed. Thereafter the insurer and the department may present testimony relevant to the investigation. Cross examination shall be conducted only by the commissioner or his representative.

Nothing contained in this code shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter relating thereto, as authorized by and in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 26-2-113(d). In the event the commissioner determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of any examination, he may initiate any proceedings or actions as provided by law. The provisions of W.S. 26-2-116 through 26-2-124 with regard to release of information shall prevail should any conflict arise between this act and W.S. 16-4-201 through 16-4-205.</p>

                  <p>(a) If any person asks to be excused from attending or testifying or from producing any books, papers, records, correspondence, documents or other evidence in connection with any examination, investigation or hearing the commissioner or his representative conducts, or in any proceeding or action before any court or magistrate upon a charge of violation of this code, on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture, and, notwithstanding, is directed by the commissioner and the attorney general to give the testimony or produce the evidence, he shall comply with that direction. The person shall not thereafter be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or because of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he may have testified or produced evidence, and no testimony given or evidence produced shall be received against him upon any criminal action, investigation or proceeding, except that no person so testifying is exempt from prosecution or punishment for perjury.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any person may execute, acknowledge and file in the department a statement expressly waiving the immunity or privilege in respect to any transaction, matter or thing specified in the statement. The testimony of that person or the evidence in relation to the transaction, matter or thing may then be received or produced before any judge or justice, court, tribunal, magistrate, grand jury or otherwise, and if so received or produced the person is not entitled to any immunity or privileges because of any testimony he gives or evidence he produces.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-2-125. Commissioner's hearings; generally; when required; request for hearing; stay.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The commissioner may hold a hearing without request by others for any purpose within the scope of this code.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner shall hold a hearing:</p>
                  <p>(i) If required by this code or the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Upon written request therefor by a person aggrieved by any act, threatened act or failure of the commissioner to act, or by any report, rule, regulation or order of the commissioner, other than an order for the holding of a hearing, or an order on a hearing or pursuant to the order, of which the person had notice.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any request for hearing shall be filed in the department within ninety (90) days after the person knows or reasonably should know of the act, threatened act, failure, report or order, unless a different period is provided for by other laws applicable to a particular matter, in which case the other law governs. A hearing as to the legality of a rule or regulation may be requested within ninety (90) days after the person knows or reasonably should know of the application or proposed application of the rule or regulation as to the person in a particular instance.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any request for hearing shall summarize the information and grounds to be relied upon as a basis for the relief to be sought at the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the commissioner finds that the request is made in good faith, that the person would be aggrieved if his grounds are established and that the grounds otherwise justify the hearing, he shall hold the hearing within thirty (30) days from the date the request is filed, unless postponed by mutual consent. Failure to hold the hearing upon request of a person entitled thereto as provided in this section constitutes a denial of the relief sought and is the equivalent of a final order of the commissioner for the purpose of an appeal under W.S. 26-2-129.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any request for hearing the commissioner receives prior to the effective date of action he takes or proposes to take stays the action pending the hearing, except as to action taken or proposed under an order:</p>
                  <p>(i) On hearing;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Pursuant to an order on hearing;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To make good an impairment of the capital funds of an insurer; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Made pursuant to chapter 14 of this code.</p>
                  <p>(g) If an automatic stay is not provided for, and if the commissioner after written request therefor fails to grant a stay, the person aggrieved may apply to the district court of Laramie county for a stay of the commissioner's action.</p>

                  <p>(i) That the proposed action may be taken unless the person shows cause at a hearing to be held as specified in the notice why the proposed action should not be taken; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The basis of the proposed action.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notice of hearing shall otherwise be in accordance with W.S. 16-3-107, except that mailed notice is deemed to have been served when addressed to the person to be notified at his address last of record with the department and deposited, postage paid, in a mail depository of the United States post office.</p>

                  <p>(a) The commissioner may issue a cease and desist order if:</p>
                  <p>(i) It appears from specific facts shown by affidavit that a person, as defined by W.S. 26-1-102(a)(xx), is engaging in any act or practice prohibited under this code which is causing or can be reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent and irreparable injury to the insuring public; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) That the department has either discussed the matter with the person or has made a good-faith attempt to do so.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon issuance of a cease and desist order, the commissioner shall serve upon the person affected by the order, by personal service as defined in rule 4 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person's last known address, an order specifically stating the acts complained of and requiring the person to immediately cease and desist from the act, methods or practices stated. The cease and desist order shall have full force and effect as soon as it is received unless stayed by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. The cease and desist order shall be of no effect at the end of the second business day following its issuance unless the commissioner shall have obtained a temporary restraining order, pursuant to rule 65 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure or the person receiving the order shall have stipulated that it remain in effect pursuant to terms and conditions agreed upon by the commissioner and that person. Thereafter, the commissioner may seek such further orders of the court to enforce the cease and desist order as he deems appropriate or necessary. If a temporary restraining order is sought in accordance with this subsection, the cease and desist order shall remain in effect until the temporary restraining order or any extension thereof is denied, or until the cease and desist order is modified or stayed by an order of the court. The action seeking the temporary restraining order shall be filed in the district court for Laramie county or in the district court for the county in which person affected by the order resides or has his principal place of business.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the person affected by the cease and desist order seeks to contest the order, the person shall request a hearing before the commissioner not later than ten (10) days after the date on which the person received the order. A request to contest an order shall be in writing, served upon the commissioner by personal service as defined in rule 4 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, or by registered or certified mail, and shall state the grounds for the request to set aside or modify the order.</p>
                  <p>(d) On receiving the request for a hearing, the commissioner shall serve notice of the time and place of the hearing at which the person requesting the hearing shall have the opportunity to show cause why the order should not be affirmed. The hearing shall be held within ten (10) days from the date the request for hearing is received unless mutually waived by the parties or continuance granted by the commissioner for good cause. The cease and desist order shall continue in full force and effect while the hearing is pending unless the order is stayed by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(e) The hearing on the order shall be conducted according to the procedures for contested cases under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(f) Within two (2) working days after the hearing, the commissioner shall affirm, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, the cease and desist order.</p>
                  <p>(g) A cease and desist order shall be final eleven (11) days after the date the order is received by the person if a hearing as provided by subsection (c) of this section is not requested by the person affected by the order.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any person violating a cease and desist order issued under this section shall be assessed a civil penalty as provided by W.S. 26-1-107(b). If the commissioner reasonably believes that a person has violated a cease and desist order issued under this section, the commissioner may initiate judicial proceedings to enjoin further violation of the order in the district court for Laramie county or in the district court for the county in which the person resides or has his principal place of business.</p>
                  <p>(j) The commissioner may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out the purpose of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) Any final order, ruling, finding, decision or other act of the commissioner made pursuant to this chapter or this section shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to any other tax, license or fee imposed by law, each authorized insurer shall pay to the commissioner on or before June 1 of each year a fee for the privilege of transacting the business of insurance in this state, computed as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) On or before April 1 of each year, the commissioner, with the governor's approval, shall estimate the expenditures of the department for the fiscal year commencing July 1, including the expense of any regularly scheduled association, zone, triannual or similar periodic statutorily scheduled financial examination of any authorized insurer, provided that neither the actual expenditures nor estimated expenditures of a fiscal year within the same biennial budget for the department shall not exceed the amount appropriated to the department by law; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The commissioner shall then divide the estimated amount of expenditures, after deducting therefrom any expected unexpended funds in the account of the insurance department, by the total number of insurers then authorized to transact insurance in this state as of December 31 of the immediately preceding year. The result of this computation is the amount of the fee the commissioner shall assess each insurer.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon receiving a statement of assessment from the commissioner, each authorized insurer shall promptly pay the fee to the commissioner.</p>

                  <p>(b) The commissioner shall not grant or continue authority to transact insurance in this state as to any insurer the management of which, after investigation or upon reliable information, he finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is incompetent or untrustworthy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) So lacking in insurance company managerial experience as to make a proposed operation hazardous to the insurance-buying public; or</p>

                  <p>(i) The wholly owned subsidiary or affiliate of an insurer which is already an authorized insurer in Wyoming and the subsidiary or affiliate shares common management and business operations with the insurer;</p>

                  <p>(A) Adequate provision is not made by insurers already authorized in this state; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Adequate competition between insurers does not exist in this state.</p>
                  <p>(b) No foreign insurer shall continue to hold a certificate of authority under W.S. 26-3-114 if the insurer has reinsured substantially all of its insurance risks either prior to, contemporaneously with or after being acquired by another insurer not holding a subsisting certificate of authority in this state.</p>

                  <p>(b) As to foreign insurers, instead of the deposit or part thereof in this state, the commissioner shall accept the certificate in proper form of the public official having supervision over insurers in any other state to the effect that a like deposit or part thereof by the insurer is being maintained in public custody or control pursuant to law in the other state in trust for the protection of all its policyholders wherever located, or of all its policyholders in the United States, or all of its policyholders and creditors in the United States. All such deposits shall be in cash or securities, or both, of a quality not less than those eligible for deposit in this state under W.S. 26-8-103.</p>
                  <p>(c) A property insurer also writing hail-crop coverages is required to have only the deposit applicable to property insurance. Instead of the hail-crop deposit, a domestic mutual hail-crop insurer, upon the commissioner's approval, may file with the commissioner and maintain reinsurance of all risk under all of the insurer's hail-crop policies. The reinsurer shall be qualified for a certificate of authority as a stock property insurer under this code, and the reinsurance agreement shall provide for payment by the reinsurer of one hundred percent (100%) of all losses under hail-crop policies issued by the ceding insurer without assessment of policyholders of the ceding insurer.</p>
                  <p>(d) All deposits in this state are subject to the applicable provisions of chapter 8 of this code.</p>
                  <p>(e) In addition to deposits required or maintained by foreign insurers, the commissioner may require any foreign insurer to make and maintain in trust in this state, through the commissioner, a deposit of cash or securities eligible for deposit under W.S. 26-8-103, of a value not less than an amount which the commissioner specifies, for the sole protection of an insurer's policyholders located in this state. All additional deposits are subject to the applicable provisions of chapter 8 of this code.</p>

                  <p>(c) Any insurer subject to an order under subsection (b) of this section may request a hearing to review that order as provided in W.S. 26-2-125.

                  <p>(a) Each insurer required by this article to file an annual audited financial report shall within sixty (60) days after becoming subject to the requirement, register with the commissioner in writing the name and address of the independent certified public accountant or accounting firm retained to conduct the annual audit. Insurers not retaining an independent certified public accountant on or before April 1, 1994 shall register the name and address of their retained independent certified public accountant not less than six (6) months before the date when the first audited financial report is to be filed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The insurer shall obtain a letter from the accountant, and file a copy with the commissioner stating that the accountant is aware of the provisions of the insurance code and the rules and regulations of the insurance department of the state of domicile that relate to accounting and financial matters and affirming that he will express his opinion on the financial statements in terms of their conformity to the statutory accounting practices prescribed or otherwise permitted by that department, specifying the exceptions he believes appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(c) If an accountant who was the accountant for the immediately preceding filed audited financial report is dismissed or resigns, the insurer shall within five (5) business days notify the department of this event. The insurer shall also furnish the commissioner with a separate letter within ten (10) business days of the above notification stating whether in the twenty-four (24) months preceding the dismissal or resignation there were any disagreements with the former accountant on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former accountant would have caused him to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with his opinion. The disagreements required to be reported under this subsection include both those resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction and those not resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction. Disagreements required to be reported under this subsection are those which occur at the decision-making level, between personnel of the insurer responsible for presentation of its financial statements and personnel of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its report. The insurer shall also in writing request and the former accountant shall furnish a letter addressed to the department with a copy to the insurer stating whether the accountant agrees with the statements contained in the insurer's letter and, if not, stating the reasons for which he does not agree.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-3-306. Qualifications of independent certified public accountant.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The commissioner shall not recognize any person or firm as a qualified independent certified public accountant if that person or firm:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is not in good standing with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in all states in which the accountant is licensed to practice, or, for a Canadian or British company, that is not a chartered accountant; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has either directly or indirectly entered into an agreement of indemnification with respect to the audit of the insurer.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the commissioner shall recognize an independent certified public accountant as qualified as long as he conforms to the standards of his profession, as contained in the code of professional ethics of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and rules and regulations and code of ethics and rules of professional conduct of the Wyoming board of certified public accountants, or similar code.</p>
                  <p>(c) After January 1, 2010, the lead or coordinating audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit shall not act in that capacity for more than five (5) consecutive years. The person shall be disqualified from acting in that or a similar capacity for the same company or its insurance subsidiaries or affiliates for a period of five (5) consecutive years. An insurer may make application to the commissioner for relief from the rotation requirement on the basis of unusual circumstances. This application shall be made at least thirty (30) days before the end of the calendar year. The insurer shall file with its annual statement, the approval for relief pursuant to this subsection with the states in which it is licensed or doing business and with the NAIC. If the nondomestic state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the NAIC. The commissioner may consider the following factors in determining whether the relief should be granted:</p>
                  <p>(i) Number of partners, expertise of the partners or the number of insurance clients in the currently registered firm;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Premium volume of the insurer; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Number of jurisdictions in which the insurer transacts business.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commissioner shall neither recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant, nor accept any annual audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by, any natural person who:</p>
                  <p>(i) Has been convicted of fraud, bribery, a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Sections 1961 through 1968, or any dishonest conduct or practices under federal or state law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has been found to have violated the insurance laws of this state with respect to any previous reports submitted under this article; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Has demonstrated a pattern or practice of failing to detect or disclose material information in previous reports filed under the provisions of this article.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commissioner may hold a hearing to determine whether an independent certified public accountant is qualified and, considering the evidence presented, may rule that the accountant is not qualified for purposes of expressing his opinion on the financial statements in the annual audited financial report made pursuant to this article and require the insurer to replace the accountant with another whose relationship with the insurer is qualified within the meaning of this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) A qualified independent certified public accountant may enter into an agreement with an insurer to have disputes relating to an audit resolved by mediation or arbitration. However, in the event of a delinquency proceeding commenced against the insurer under chapter 28 of this code, the mediation or arbitration provisions shall operate at the option of the statutory successor.</p>
                  <p>(g) The commissioner shall neither recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant, nor accept an annual audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by an accountant who provides to an insurer, contemporaneously with the audit, the following nonaudit services:</p>
                  <p>(i) Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the insurer;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Financial information systems design and implementation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinion or contribution-in-kind reports;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Actuarially-oriented advisory services involving the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statements. The accountant may assist an insurer in understanding the methods, assumptions and inputs used in the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statement only if it is reasonable to conclude that the services provided will not be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the insurer's financial statements. An accountant's actuary may also issue an actuarial opinion or certification on an insurer's reserves if the following conditions have been met:</p>
                  <p>(A) Neither the accountant nor the accountant's actuary has performed any management functions or made any management decisions;</p>
                  <p>(B) The insurer has competent personnel or engages a third party actuary to estimate the reserves for which management takes responsibility; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The accountant's actuary tests the reasonableness of the reserves after insurer's management has determined the amount of the reserves.</p>
                  <p>(v) Internal audit outsourcing services;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Management functions or human resources;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Legal services or expert services unrelated to the audit; or</p>
                  <p>(ix) Any other services that the commissioner determines by regulation to be impermissible. In determining whether other services are impermissible, the commissioner shall consider the principle that the accountant may not function in the role of management, may not audit his own work and may not serve in an advocacy role for the insurer.</p>
                  <p>(h) Insurers having direct written and assumed premiums of less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00) in any calendar year may request an exemption from subsection (g) of this section. The insurer shall file with the commissioner a written statement discussing the reasons why the insurer should be exempt from subsection (g) of this section. If the commissioner finds, upon review of the statement, that compliance with subsection (g) of this section would constitute a financial or organizational hardship on the insurer, an exemption may be granted.</p>
                  <p>(j) A qualified independent certified public accountant who performs the audit may engage in other nonaudit services, including tax services, that are not described in subsection (g) of this section or that do not conflict with paragraph (g)(ix) of this section only if the activity is approved in advance by the audit committee in accordance with subsection (k) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) All auditing services and nonaudit services provided to an insurer by the qualified independent certified public accountant of the insurer shall be preapproved by the audit committee. The preapproval requirement shall be waived with respect to nonaudit services if the insurer is a SOX compliant entity or a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a SOX compliant entity or if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The aggregate amount of all nonaudit services provided to the insurer constitutes not more than five percent (5%) of the total amount of fees paid by the insurer to its qualified independent certified public accountant during the fiscal year in which the nonaudit services are provided;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The services were not recognized by the insurer at the time of the engagement to be nonaudit services; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The services are promptly brought to the attention of the audit committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the audit committee or by one (1) or more members of the audit committee who are the members of the board of directors to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the audit committee.</p>
                  <p>(m) The audit committee may delegate to one (1) or more designated members of the audit committee the authority to grant the preapprovals required under subsection (k) of this section. The decisions of any member to whom this authority is delegated shall be presented to the full audit committee at each of its scheduled meetings.</p>
                  <p>(n) The commissioner shall not recognize an independent certified public accountant as qualified for a particular insurer if a member of the board, president, chief executive officer, controller, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or any person serving in an equivalent position for that insurer was employed by the independent certified public accountant and participated in the audit of that insurer during the one (1) year period preceding the date that the most current statutory opinion is due. This subsection shall only apply to partners and senior managers involved in the audit. An insurer may make application to the commissioner for relief from this subsection on the basis of unusual circumstances. The insurer shall file with its annual statement filing the approval for relief under this subsection with the states that it is licensed in or doing business in and with the NAIC. If the nondomestic state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the NAIC.</p>

                  <p>(a) An insurer may make written application to the commissioner for approval to file audited consolidated or combined financial statements in lieu of separate annual audited financial statements if the insurer is part of a group of insurance companies which utilizes a pooling or one hundred percent (100%) reinsurance agreement that affects the solvency and integrity of the insurer's reserves and the insurer cedes all of its direct and assumed business to the pool. In those cases, a columnar consolidating or combining supplemental schedules shall be filed with the report, as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Amounts shown on the consolidated or combined audited financial report shall be shown on the supplemental schedules;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Amounts for each insurer subject to this section shall be stated separately;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Noninsurance operations may be shown on the supplemental schedules on a combined or individual basis;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Explanations of consolidating and eliminating entries shall be included;</p>
                  <p>(v) A reconciliation shall be included of any differences between the amounts shown in the individual insurer columns of the supplemental schedules and comparable amounts shown on the annual statements of the insurers.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-3-315. Requirements for audit committees.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An audit committee shall be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any accountant, including resolution of disagreements between management and the accountant regarding financial reporting, employed for the purpose of preparing or issuing the audited financial report or related work pursuant to this article and each accountant shall report directly to the audit committee.</p>
                  <p>(b) The audit committee of an insurer or group of insurers shall be responsible for overseeing the insurer's internal audit function and granting the persons performing the function suitable authority and resources to fulfill their responsibilities if required by W.S. 26-3-316.</p>
                  <p>(c) Each member of the audit committee shall be a member of the board of directors of the insurer or a member of the board of directors of an entity elected pursuant to W.S. 26-3-302(a)(vi) and subsection (f) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) In order to be considered independent for purposes of this section, a member of the audit committee shall not, other than in his capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee, accept any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the entity or be an affiliated person of the entity or any subsidiary thereof. If any other provision of law requires board participation by otherwise nonindependent members, that law shall prevail and those members may participate in the audit committee and be designated as independent for audit committee purposes unless they are an officer or employee of the insurer or one (1) of its affiliates.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a member of the audit committee ceases to be independent for reasons outside the member's reasonable control, that person, with notice by the responsible entity to the state, may remain an audit committee member of the responsible entity until the earlier of the next annual meeting of the responsible entity or one (1) year from the occurrence of the event that caused the member to be no longer independent.</p>
                  <p>(f) To exercise the election of the controlling person to designate the audit committee for purposes of this article, the ultimate controlling person shall provide written notice to the commissioners of the affected insurers. Notification shall be made timely prior to the issuance of the statutory audit report and include a description of the basis for the election. The election may be changed through notice to the commissioner by the insurer which shall include a description of the basis for the change. The election shall remain in effect for perpetuity, until rescinded.</p>
                  <p>(g) The audit committee shall require the accountant that performs for an insurer any audit required by this article to timely report to the audit committee in accordance with the requirements of Statement on Auditing Standards 61, Communication with Audit Committees, or its replacement, including:</p>
                  <p>(i) All significant accounting policies and material permitted practices;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All material alternative treatments of financial information within statutory accounting principles that have been discussed with management officials of the insurer, ramifications of the use of the alternative disclosures and treatments and the treatment preferred by the accountant; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Other material written communications between the accountant and the management of the insurer, such as any management letter or schedule of unadjusted differences.</p>
                  <p>(h) If an insurer is a member of an insurance holding company system, the reports required under subsection (g) of this section may be provided to the audit committee on an aggregate basis for insurers in the holding company system, provided that any substantial differences among insurers in the system are identified to the audit committee.</p>
                  <p>(j) The proportion of independent audit committee members shall meet or exceed the following criteria, except that the commissioner has authority afforded by state law to require the entity's board to enact improvements to the independence of the audit committee membership if the insurer is in any RBC action level event, meets one (1) or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition or otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer:</p>
                  <p>(i) For insurers with prior calendar year direct written and assumed premiums of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000.00) or less the audit committee shall have a majority of members that are independent and the insurers are encouraged to structure their audit committees with at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the audit committee members being independent;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For insurers with prior calendar year direct written and assumed premiums of more than five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000.00) at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the members of the audit committee shall be independent;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For purposes of this subsection, prior calendar year direct written and assumed premiums shall be the combined total of direct premiums and assumed premiums from nonaffiliates for the reporting entities.</p>
                  <p>(k) An insurer with direct written and assumed premiums, excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, less than five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000.00) may make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this section based on hardship. The insurer shall file, with its annual statement filing, the approval for relief from this section with the states that it is licensed in or doing business in and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. If the nondomestic state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the NAIC.</p>
                  <p>(m) This section shall not apply to foreign or alien insurers licensed in this state or an insurer that is a SOX compliant entity or a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a SOX compliant entity, as defined in W.S. 26-3-302(a)(xiii).</p>
                  <p>(n) An insurer or group of insurers that is not required to have independent audit committee members or only a majority of independent audit committee members because the total written and assumed premium is below the threshold and subsequently becomes subject to any of the independence requirements due to changes in premiums shall have one (1) year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the independence requirements. An insurer that becomes subject to any of the independence requirements as a result of a business combination shall have one (1) calendar year following the date of acquisition or combination to comply with the independence requirements.</p>

                  <p>(a) An insurer is exempt from the requirements of this section if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The insurer has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premiums, including international direct and assumed premiums, but excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, less than five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000.00); and</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the insurer is a member of a group of insurers, the group has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premiums, including international direct and assumed premiums, but excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, less than one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) Each insurer or group of insurers shall establish an internal audit function providing independent oversight regarding the insurer's governance, risk management and internal controls. This oversight shall be provided by performing general and specific audits, reviews and tests and by employing other techniques deemed necessary to protect assets, evaluate control effectiveness and efficiency and evaluate compliance with policies and regulations.</p>
                  <p>(c) The internal audit function shall be organizationally independent. Specifically, the internal audit function shall not defer ultimate judgment on audit matters to others and shall appoint an individual to head the internal audit function who shall have direct and unrestricted access to the board of directors. Organizational independence does not preclude dual reporting relationships.</p>
                  <p>(d) The head of the internal audit function shall report to the audit committee regularly, but not less than annually, on the periodic audit plan, factors that may adversely impact the internal audit function's independence or effectiveness, material findings from completed audits and the appropriateness of corrective actions implemented by management as a result of audit findings.</p>
                  <p>(e) If an insurer is a member of an insurance holding company system or included in a group of insurers, the insurer may satisfy the internal audit function requirements set forth in this section at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level or the individual legal entity level.</p>

                  <p>(a) Every insurer required to file an audited financial report pursuant to this article that has annual direct written and assumed premiums, excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000.00) or more shall prepare a report of the insurer's or group of insurers' internal control over financial reporting. The report shall be filed with the commissioner along with the communication of internal control related matters noted in an audit described in W.S. 26- 3-310. Management's report of internal control over financial reporting shall be as of the immediately preceding December 31.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding the premium threshold in subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section, the commissioner may require an insurer to file management's report of internal control over financial reporting if the insurer is in any RBC level event or meets any one (1) or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition as defined in W.S. 26-3-116.</p>
                  <p>(c) An insurer or group of insurers that is directly subject to section 404, part of a holding company system whose parent is directly subject to section 404, not directly subject to section 404 but is a SOX compliant entity or a member of a holding company system whose parent is not directly subject to section 404 but is a SOX compliant entity, may file its or its parent's section 404 report and an addendum in satisfaction of this section provided that those internal controls of the insurer or group of insurers having material impact on the preparation of the insurer's or group of insurers' audited statutory financial statements were included in the scope of the section 404 report. The addendum shall be a positive statement by management that there are no material processes with respect to the preparation of the insurer's or group of insurers' audited financial statements excluded from the section 404 report. If there are internal controls of the insurer or group of insurers that have a material impact on the preparation of the insurer's or group of insurers' audited statutory financial statements and those internal controls were not included in the scope of the section 404 report, the insurer or group of insurers may either file a report under this section or the section 404 report and a report under this section for those internal controls that have a material impact on the preparation of the insurer's or group of insurers' audited statutory financial statements not covered by the section 404 report.</p>
                  <p>(d) A management's report of internal control over financial reporting shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A statement that management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A statement that management has established internal control over financial reporting and an assertion to the best of management's knowledge and belief, after diligent inquiry, as to whether its internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A statement that briefly describes the approach or processes by which management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A statement that briefly describes the scope of work that is included and whether any internal controls were excluded;</p>
                  <p>(v) Disclosure of any unremediated material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting identified by management as of the immediately preceding December 31. Management shall not conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles if there is one (1) or more unremediated material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A statement regarding the inherent limitations of internal control systems; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Signatures of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer or the equivalent position.</p>
                  <p>(e) Management shall document and make available upon financial condition examination the basis upon which its assertions required in subsection (d) of this section are made. Management may base its assertions, in part, upon its review, monitoring and testing of internal controls undertaken in the normal course of its activities. Management shall have discretion as to the nature of the internal control framework used and the nature and extent of documentation in order to make its assertions in a cost effective manner and may include assembly of or reference to existing documentation.</p>
                  <p>Management's report on internal control over financial reporting and any documentation provided in support thereof during the course of a financial conditions examination shall be kept confidential by the department.</p>
                  <p>(f) The requirements of this section are effective beginning with the reporting period ending December 31, 2010 and each year thereafter. An insurer or group of insurers that is not required to file a report because the total written premium is below the threshold and subsequently becomes subject to the reporting requirements shall have two (2) years following the year the threshold is exceeded to file a report. An insurer that becomes subject to any of the reporting requirements as a result of a business combination shall have two (2) calendar years following the date of acquisition or combination to comply with the reporting requirements.</p>

An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The insurer has less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year that are not subject to a pooling arrangement; and</p>

                  <p>(a) No nonrenewal, cancellation or revision of ceded reinsurance agreements need be reported pursuant to W.S. 26-3-401 if the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision is not material. For purposes of this article, a material nonrenewal, cancellation or revision is one that affects for property and casualty business, including accident and health business when written as such, more than fifty percent (50%) of an insurer's ceded written premium, or for life, annuity and accident and health business, more than fifty percent (50%) of the total reserve credit taken for business ceded, on an annualized basis as indicated in the insurer's most recently filed statutory statement. No filing is required if the insurer's ceded written premium or the total reserve credit taken for business ceded represents, on an annualized basis, less than ten percent (10%) of direct plus assumed written premium or ten percent (10%) of the statutory reserve requirement prior to any cession, respectively.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to subsection (a) of this section, a report shall be filed without regard to which party has initiated the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision of ceded reinsurance whenever one (1) or more of the following conditions exist:</p>
                  <p>(i) The entire cession has been canceled, nonrenewed or revised and ceded indemnity and loss adjustment expense reserves after any nonrenewal, cancellation or revision represent less than fifty percent (50%) of the comparable reserves that would have been ceded had the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision not occurred;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An authorized or accredited reinsurer has been replaced on an existing cession by an unauthorized reinsurer; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Collateral requirements previously established for unauthorized reinsurers have been reduced, including, but not limited to, the requirement to collateralize incurred but not reported claim reserves being waived with respect to one (1) or more unauthorized reinsurers newly participating in an existing cession.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subject to subsection (a) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (b)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a report shall be filed if the result of the revision affects more than ten percent (10%) of the cession.</p>
                  <p>(d) The following information is required to be disclosed in any report of a material nonrenewal, cancellation or revision of ceded reinsurance agreements:</p>
                  <p>(i) Effective date of the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The description of the transaction with an identification of the initiator;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Purpose of, or reason for, the transaction; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) If applicable, the identity of the replacement reinsurers.</p>
                  <p>(e) Insurers are required to report all material nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements on a nonconsolidated basis unless the insurer is part of a consolidated group of insurers which utilizes a pooling arrangement or one hundred percent (100%) reinsurance agreement that affects the solvency and integrity of the insurer's reserves and the insurer ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to the pool. An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if the insurer has less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year which are not subject to a pooling arrangement and the net income of the business not subject to the pooling arrangement represents less than five percent (5%) of the insurer's capital and surplus.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, any notice to a party or any other document required under applicable law in an insurance transaction or that is to serve as evidence of insurance coverage may be delivered, stored and presented by electronic means so long as it meets the requirements of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, W.S. 40-21-101 through 40-21-119.</p>
                  <p>(b) Delivery of a notice or document in accordance with this section shall be considered equivalent to any delivery method required under applicable law including chapter 35 of this code, including delivery by first class mail, first class mail postage prepaid, certified mail, certificate of mail or certificate of mailing.</p>
                  <p>(c) A notice or document may be delivered by electronic means by an insurer to a party under this section if all of the following are met:</p>
                  <p>(i) The party has affirmatively consented to that method of delivery and has not withdrawn the consent;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The party, before giving consent, is provided with a clear and conspicuous statement informing the party of:</p>
                  <p>(A) Any right or option of the party to have the notice or document provided or made available in paper or another nonelectronic form;</p>
                  <p>(B) The right of the party to withdraw consent to have a notice or document delivered by electronic means and any fees, conditions or consequences imposed in the event consent is withdrawn;</p>
                  <p>(C) Whether the party's consent applies:</p>
                  <p>(I) Only to the particular transaction as to which the notice or document must be given; or</p>
                  <p>(II) To identified categories of notices or documents that may be delivered by electronic means during the course of the parties' relationship.</p>
                  <p>(D) The means, after consent is given, by which a party may obtain a paper copy of a notice or document delivered by electronic means and the fee, if any, for the paper copy; and</p>
                  <p>(E) The procedure a party must follow to withdraw consent to have a notice or document delivered by electronic means and to update information needed to contact the party electronically.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The party:</p>
                  <p>(A) Before giving consent, is provided with a statement of the hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Consents electronically, or confirms consent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the party can access information in the electronic form that will be used for notices or documents delivered by electronic means as to which the party has given consent.</p>
                  <p>(iv) After consent of the party is given, the insurer, in the event a change in the hardware or software requirements needed to access or retain a notice or document delivered by electronic means creates a material risk that the party will not be able to access or retain a subsequent notice or document to which the consent applies:</p>
                  <p>(A) Delivery to an electronic mail address at which a party has consented to receive notices or documents; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Posting on an electronic network or site accessible via the internet, mobile application, computer, mobile device, tablet or any other electronic device, together with separate notice of the posting which shall be provided by electronic mail to the address at which the party has consented to receive notice or by any other delivery method that has been consented to by the party.</p>
                  <p>(I) The revised hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a notice or document delivered by electronic means;</p>
                  <p>(II) The right of the party to withdraw consent without the imposition of any fee, condition, or consequence that was not disclosed under subparagraph (ii)(B) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section does not affect requirements related to content or timing of any notice or document required under applicable law.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a provision of this title or applicable law requiring a notice or document to be provided to a party expressly requires verification or acknowledgment of receipt of the notice or document, the notice or document may be delivered by electronic means only if the method used provides for verification or acknowledgment of receipt.</p>
                  <p>(f) The legal effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any contract or policy of insurance executed by a party may not be denied solely because of the failure to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent of the party in accordance with subparagraph (c)(iii)(B) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) With respect to withdrawal of consent, the following apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) A withdrawal of consent by a party does not affect the legal effectiveness, validity or enforceability of a notice or document delivered by electronic means to the party before the withdrawal of consent is effective;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A withdrawal of consent by a party is effective within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the withdrawal by the insurer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Failure by an insurer to comply with paragraph (c)(iv) of this section may be treated, at the election of the party, as a withdrawal of consent for purposes of this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) This section does not apply to a notice or document delivered by an insurer in an electronic form before July 1, 2014 to a party who, before that date, has consented to receive notice or document in an electronic form otherwise allowed by law.</p>
                  <p>(j) If the consent of a party to receive certain notices or documents in an electronic form is on file with an insurer before July 1, 2014, and pursuant to this section, an insurer intends to deliver additional notices or documents to such party in an electronic form, then prior to delivering such additional notices or documents electronically, the insurer shall notify the party of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The notices or documents that may be delivered by electronic means under this section that were not previously delivered electronically; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The party's right to withdraw consent to have notices or documents delivered by electronic means.</p>
                  <p>(k) Except as otherwise provided by law, if an oral communication or a recording of an oral communication from a party can be reliably stored and reproduced by an insurer, the oral communication or recording may qualify as a notice or document delivered by electronic means for purposes of this section. If a provision of this title or applicable law requires a signature or notice or document to be notarized, acknowledged, verified or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by the provision, is attached to or logically associated with the signature, notice or document.</p>
                  <p>(m) This section may not be construed to modify, limit or supersede the provisions of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, Public Law 106-229, as amended.</p>
                  <p>(n) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Delivered by electronic means" includes:</p>
                  <p>(A) Delivery to an electronic mail address at which a party has consented to receive notices or documents; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Posting on an electronic network or site accessible via the internet, mobile application, computer, mobile device, tablet or any other electronic device, together with separate notice of the posting which shall be provided by electronic mail to the address at which the party has consented to receive notice or by any other delivery method that has been consented to by the party.</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Party" means any recipient of any notice or document required as part of an insurance transaction, including but not limited to an applicant, an insured, a policyholder or an annuity contract holder.</p>

                <p>(a) No insurer, other than a title insurer, shall retain any risk on any one (1) subject of insurance, regardless of where located or to be performed, in an amount exceeding ten percent (10%) of its surplus to policyholders.</p>
                <p>(b) A "subject of insurance" for the purposes of this section, as to insurance against fire and hazards other than windstorm, earthquake and other catastrophic hazards, includes all properties insured by the same insurer which are customarily considered by underwriters to be subject to loss or damage from the same fire or the same occurrence of any other hazard insured against.</p>
                <p>(c) Reinsurance ceded as authorized by W.S. 26-5-111 shall be deducted in determining risk retained. As to surety risks, the amount assumed by any established incorporated cosurety and the value of any security deposited, pledged or held subject to the surety's consent and for the surety's protection shall also be deducted.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-5-112. Credit allowed a domestic ceding insurer.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as provided in W.S. 26-5-113, and in addition to any rules adopted by the commissioner pursuant to W.S. 26-5-116 relating to the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements and the circumstances pursuant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated, credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a deduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only if the reinsurer meets the requirements of any one (1) of the following paragraphs:</p>
                <p>(i) The reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is licensed to transact insurance in this state;</p>
                <p>(ii) The reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is accredited as a reinsurer in this state and whose accreditation has not been revoked by the commissioner. An accredited reinsurer is one which:</p>
                <p>(A) Files with the commissioner evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction;</p>
                <p>(B) Submits to this state's authority to examine its books and records;</p>
                <p>(C) Is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one (1) state, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one (1) state;</p>
                <p>(D) Files annually with the commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and</p>
                <p>(I) Repealed by Laws 2017, ch. 29, § 2.</p>
                <p>(II) Repealed by Laws 2017, ch. 29, § 2.</p>
                <p>(E) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000.00) and its accreditation has not been denied by the commissioner within ninety (90) days after submission of its application.</p>
                <p>(iii) The reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which is domiciled and licensed in, or in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through and licensed in, a state which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance which meet or exceed those applicable under this section and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer:</p>
                <p>(A) Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000.00), provided however that this requirement does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system; and</p>
                <p>(B) Submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records.</p>
                <p>(iv) The reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of paragraphs (i) through (iii) or</p>
                <p>(v) of this subsection but only with respect to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions where such reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction;</p>
                <p>(v) The reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in W.S. 26-5-114(b), for the payment of the valid claims of its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the NAIC annual statement form by licensed insurers to enable the commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the commissioner and bear the expense of examination. In the case of:</p>
                <p>(A) A single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000.00). At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three (3) years, the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than thirty percent (30%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust;</p>
                <p>(B) A group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the group's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition:</p>
                <p>(I) The group shall maintain a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00) shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group;</p>
                <p>(II) Within ninety (90) days after its financial statements are due, the group shall make available to the commissioner an annual certification of the solvency of each underwriter by the group's domiciliary regulator and its independent public accountants; and</p>
                <p>(III) The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.</p>
                <p>(vi) The reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is certified by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with the following provisions:</p>
                <p>(A) Prior to certification by the commissioner, the assuming insurer must be eligible for certification. In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall:</p>
                <p>(I) Be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(II) Maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by rule and regulation of the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(III) Maintain financial strength ratings from two (2) or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by rule and regulation of the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(IV) Agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, appoint the commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state and agree to provide security for one hundred percent (100%) of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment;</p>
                <p>(V) Agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis; and</p>
                <p>(VI) Satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed necessary by the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(B) Prior to certification by the commissioner, an association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters must be eligible for certification by the commissioner. In order to be eligible for certification, an association must satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and comply with the following requirements:</p>
                <p>(I) The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents, taking into account liabilities, of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the commissioner to provide adequate protection;</p>
                <p>(II) The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; and</p>
                <p>(III) Within ninety (90) days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.</p>
                <p>(C) Prior to certification, the assuming insurer must be licensed and domiciled in a jurisdiction eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner. The commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner as a certified reinsurer. The commissioner shall:</p>
                <p>(I) In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction shall agree to share information and cooperate with the commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction shall not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(II) Consider the list of qualified jurisdictions published through the NAIC committee process in determining qualified jurisdictions. If the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the commissioner shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria developed under rule and regulation developed by the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(III) Recognize as qualified jurisdictions the United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program;</p>
                <p>(IV) If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, have the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.</p>
                <p>(D) Each certified reinsurer must receive a financial rating from the commissioner. The commissioner shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner pursuant to regulation. The commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings;</p>
                <p>(E) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this paragraph at a level consistent with its rating and as specified by rule and regulation promulgated by the commissioner. In fulfilling the requirements of this subparagraph:</p>
                <p>(I) In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of W.S. 26-5-113, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with paragraph (v) of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(II) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to paragraph (v) of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this paragraph or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to paragraph (v) of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section. It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this paragraph that the certified reinsurer have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each trust account, to fund, upon termination of any trust account, out of the remaining surplus of the trust any deficiency of any other trust account;</p>
                <p>(III) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this paragraph, except that any trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00);</p>
                <p>(IV) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this paragraph, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency and may impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding there is a material risk the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due;</p>
                <p>(V) For purposes of this paragraph, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent (100%) of its obligations. If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this section, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended. As used in this subdivision, "terminated" refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender and inactive status.</p>
                <p>(F) If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner may defer to that jurisdiction's certification and may defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and the assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state;</p>
                <p>(G) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this paragraph, and the commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business, if relevant.</p>
                <p>(b) A trust under paragraph (a)(v) of this section shall be established in a form approved by the commissioner. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in the trustees of the trust for its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the commissioner. The trust described herein shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer shall have outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. No later than February 28 of each year the trustees of the trust shall report to the commissioner in writing setting forth the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust shall not expire prior to the next following December 31.</p>
                <p>(c) If the assuming insurer is not licensed, certified or accredited to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit permitted by paragraphs (a)(iii) and (v) of this section shall not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements:</p>
                <p>(i) That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, shall comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and shall abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and</p>
                <p>(ii) To designate the commissioner as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer.</p>
                <p>(d) Subsection (c) of this section shall not supersede the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if such an obligation is created in the agreement.</p>
                <p>(e) If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification in accordance with the following:</p>
                <p>(i) The commissioner shall give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hearing. The suspension or revocation shall not take effect until after the commissioner's order on hearing, unless:</p>
                <p>(A) The reinsurer waives its right to a hearing;</p>
                <p>(B) The commissioner's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under subparagraph (a)(vi)(F) of this section; or</p>
                <p>(C) The commissioner finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.</p>
                <p>(ii) While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with W.S. 26-5-113. If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subparagraph (a)(vi)(E) of this section or W.S. 26-5-113.</p>
                <p>(f) A ceding insurer shall take steps to manage its reinsurance recoverables proportionate to its own book of business. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner within thirty (30) days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders, or after it is determined that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers is likely to exceed this limit. The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.</p>
                <p>(g) A ceding insurer shall take steps to diversify its reinsurance program. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner within thirty (30) days after ceding to any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers more than twenty percent (20%) of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in the prior calendar year, or after it has determined that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer or group of affiliated assuming insurers is likely to exceed this limit. The notification shall demonstrate the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.</p>
                <p>(h) Credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer is limited to reinsurance contracts entered or renewed on or after the effective date of the certification of the assuming insurer by the commissioner.</p>

                <p>(a) A reduction from liability for the reinsurance ceded by a domestic insurer to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of W.S. 26-5-112 shall be allowed in an amount not exceeding the liabilities carried by the ceding insurer, provided that the commissioner may adopt rules and regulations establishing additional requirements relating to or setting forth the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in W.S. 26-5-116 and the circumstances pursuant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated. The reduction shall be in the amount of funds held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer, including funds held in trust for the ceding insurer, under a reinsurance contract with the assuming insurer as security for the payment of obligations thereunder, if the security is held in the United States subject to withdrawal solely by, and under the exclusive control of, the ceding insurer, or, in the case of a trust, held in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in W.S. 26-5-114(b). This security may be in the form of:</p>
                <p>(i) Cash;</p>
                <p>(ii) Securities listed by the securities valuation office of the NAIC, including those deemed exempt from filing as defined by the purposes and procedures manual of the NAIC securities valuation office, and qualifying as admitted assets;</p>
                <p>(iii) Clean, irrevocable, unconditional letters of credit issued or confirmed by a qualified United States institution no later than December 31 in respect of the year for which filing is being made, and in the possession of the ceding insurer on or before the filing date of its annual statement. Letters of credit meeting applicable standards of issuer acceptability as of the dates of their issuance or confirmation shall, notwithstanding the issuing or confirming institution's subsequent failure to meet applicable standards of issuer acceptability, continue to be acceptable as security until their expiration, extension, renewal, modification or amendment, whichever first occurs; or</p>
                <p>(iv) Any other form of security acceptable to the commissioner.</p>

                <p>(a) For purposes of W.S. 26-5-113(a)(iii), a "qualified United States financial institution" means an institution that:</p>
                <p>(i) Is organized or, in the case of a United States office of a foreign banking organization licensed, under the laws of the United States or any state thereof;</p>
                <p>(ii) Is regulated, supervised and examined by United States federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Has been determined by either the commissioner, or the securities valuation office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, to meet such standards of financial condition and standing as are considered necessary and appropriate to regulate the quality of financial institutions whose letters of credit will be acceptable to the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(b) A "qualified United States financial institution" means, for purposes of those provisions of W.S. 26-5-112 and 26-5-113 specifying those institutions that are eligible to act as a fiduciary of a trust, an institution that:</p>
                <p>(i) Is organized or, in the case of a United States branch or agency office of a foreign banking organization licensed, under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and has been granted authority to operate with fiduciary powers; and</p>

                <p>(a) The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations implementing the provisions of W.S. 26-5-111 through 26-5-117.</p>
                <p>(b) Upon the commissioner's request, an insurer shall promptly inform him in writing of the cancellation or any other material change of any of its reinsurance treaties or arrangements.</p>
                <p>(c) In addition to the authority provided by subsection</p>
                <p>(a) of this section, the commissioner may adopt rules and regulations applicable to reinsurance arrangements. A regulation adopted pursuant to this subsection may apply only to reinsurance relating to:</p>
                <p>(i) Life insurance policies with guaranteed nonlevel gross premiums or guaranteed nonlevel benefits;</p>
                <p>(ii) Universal life insurance policies with provisions resulting in the ability of a policyholder to keep a policy in force over a secondary guarantee period;</p>

                <p>(d) A regulation adopted pursuant to paragraph (c)(i) or</p>
                <p>(ii) of this section may apply to a treaty containing policies issued on or after January 1, 2015 and policies issued prior to January 1, 2015 if the risk pertaining to the policies issued prior to January 1, 2015 is ceded in connection with the treaty, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 2015.</p>
                <p>(e) A regulation adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may require the ceding insurer, in calculating the amounts or forms of security required to be held under rules promulgated under this section, to use the valuation manual adopted by the NAIC under section 11B(1) of the NAIC standard valuation law, including all amendments adopted by the NAIC and in effect on the date the calculation is made, to the extent applicable.</p>
                <p>(f) A regulation adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to cessions to an assuming insurer that:</p>
                <p>(i) Is certified in this state or, if this state has not adopted provisions substantially equivalent to section 2E of the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law, certified in a minimum of five (5) other states; or</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-5-119. Life and disability reinsurance agreements; limitations.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) This section shall apply to all domestic life and domestic disability insurers and to all other licensed life and disability insurers which are not subject to a substantially similar law or regulation in their domiciliary state. This section shall also similarly apply to licensed property and casualty insurers with respect to their accident and health business. This section shall not apply to assumption reinsurance, yearly renewable term reinsurance or certain nonproportional reinsurance such as stop loss or catastrophe reinsurance.</p>
                <p>(b)(i) No insurer subject to this section shall, for reinsurance ceded, reduce any liability or establish any asset in any financial statement filed with the department if, by the terms of the reinsurance agreement, in substance or effect, any of the following conditions exist:</p>
                <p>(A) Renewal expense allowances provided or to be provided to the ceding insurer by the reinsurer in any accounting period, are not sufficient to cover anticipated allocable renewal expenses of the ceding insurer on the portion of the business reinsured, unless a liability is established for the present value of the shortfall using assumptions equal to the applicable statutory reserve basis on the business reinsured. Those expenses include commissions, premium taxes and direct expenses including, but not limited to, billing, valuation, claims and maintenance expected by the company at the time the business is reinsured;</p>
                <p>(B) The ceding insurer can be deprived of surplus or assets at the reinsurer's option or automatically upon the occurrence of some event, such as the insolvency of the ceding insurer, except that termination of the reinsurance agreement by the reinsurer for nonpayment of reinsurance premiums or other amounts due, such as modified coinsurance reserve adjustments, interest and adjustments on funds withheld, and tax reimbursements shall not be considered to be a deprivation of surplus or assets;</p>
                <p>(C) The ceding insurer is required to reimburse the reinsurer for negative experience under the reinsurance agreement. Offsetting experience refunds against current and prior years' losses under the agreement or payment by the ceding insurer of an amount equal to the current and prior years' losses under the agreement upon voluntary termination of in-force reinsurance by the ceding insurer shall not be considered a reimbursement to the reinsurer for negative experience. Voluntary termination does not include situations where termination occurs because of unreasonable provisions which allow the reinsurer to reduce its risk under the agreement;</p>
                <p>(D) The ceding insurer must, at specific points in time scheduled in the agreement, terminate or automatically recapture all or part of the reinsurance ceded;</p>
                <p>(E) The reinsurance agreement involves the possible payment by the ceding insurer to the reinsurer of amounts other than from income realized from the reinsured policies;</p>
                <p>(F) The treaty does not transfer all of the significant risk inherent in the business being reinsured. The following table identifies for a representative sampling of products or type of business, the risks which are considered to be significant. For products not specifically included, the risks determined to be significant shall be consistent with this table. The risk categories are:</p>
                <p>(I) Morbidity;</p>
                <p>(II) Mortality;</p>
                <p>(III) Lapse, meaning the risk that a policy will voluntarily terminate prior to the recoupment of a statutory surplus strain experienced at issue of the policy;</p>
                <p>(IV) Credit quality, meaning the risk that invested assets supporting the reinsured business will decrease in value. The main hazards are that assets will default or that there will be a decrease in earning power. Credit quality excludes market value declines due to changes in interest rate;</p>
                <p>(V) Reinvestment, meaning the risk that interest rates will fall and funds reinvested coupon payments or monies received upon asset maturity or call will therefore earn less than expected. If asset durations are less than liability durations, the mismatch will increase;</p>
                <p>(VI) Disintermediation, meaning the risk that interest rates rise and policy loans and surrenders increase or maturing contracts do not renew at anticipated rates of renewal.</p>

                <p>(G)(I) The credit quality, reinvestment or disintermediation risk is significant for the business reinsured and the ceding company does not, other than for the classes of business excepted in subdivision (G)(II) of this paragraph either transfer the underlying assets to the reinsurer, legally segregate such assets in a trust or escrow account or otherwise establish a mechanism which legally segregates, by contract or contract provision, the underlying assets;</p>
                <p>(II) Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (G)(I) of this paragraph, the assets supporting the reserves for the following classes of business and any classes of business which do not have a significant credit quality, reinvestment or disintermediation risk may be held by the ceding company without segregation of the assets:</p>
                <p>(1) Health insurance-long term care or long term disability;</p>
                <p>(2) Traditional nonparticipating permanent;</p>
                <p>(3) Traditional participating permanent;</p>
                <p>(4) Adjustable premium permanent;</p>
                <p>(5) Indeterminate premium permanent;</p>
                <p>(6) Universal life fixed premium, with no dump-in premiums allowed.</p>
                <p>(III) The associated formula for determining the reserve interest rate adjustment shall use a formula which reflects the ceding company's investment earnings and incorporates all realized and unrealized gains and losses reflected in the statutory statement. The following is an acceptable formula:</p>
                <p>Rate = 2(I + CG)/X + Y-I-CG</p>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <p>I is the net investment income</p>
                <p>CG is capital gains less capital losses</p>
                <p>X is the current year cash and invested assets plus investment income due and accrued less borrowed money</p>
                <p>Y is the same as X but for the prior year</p>
                <p>(H) Settlements are made less frequently than quarterly or payments due from the reinsurer are not made in cash within ninety (90) days of the settlement date;</p>
                <p>(J) The ceding insurer is required to make representations or warranties not reasonably related to the business being reinsured;</p>
                <p>(K) The ceding insurer is required to make representations or warranties about future performance of the business being reinsured;</p>
                <p>(M) The reinsurance agreement is entered into for the principal purpose of producing significant surplus aid for the ceding insurer while not transferring all of the significant risks inherent in the business reinsured and, in substance or effect, the expected potential liability to the ceding insurer remains basically unchanged.</p>
                <p>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (i) of this subsection, an insurer subject to this section may, with the prior approval of the commissioner, take reserve credit or establish assets the commissioner deems consistent with this code, rules or regulations, including actuarial interpretations or standards adopted by the department;</p>
                <p>(iii)(A) Agreements entered into after April 1, 1994 which involve the reinsurance of business issued prior to the effective date of the agreements, along with any subsequent amendments thereto, shall be filed by the ceding company with the commissioner within thirty (30) days from their date of execution. Each filing shall include data detailing the financial impact of the transaction. The ceding insurer's actuary who signs the financial statement actuarial opinion with respect to valuation of reserves shall consider this section and any applicable actuarial standards of practice when determining the proper credit in financial statements filed with the department. The actuary shall maintain adequate documentation and be prepared upon request to describe the actuarial work performed for inclusion in the financial statements and to demonstrate that the work conforms to this section;</p>
                <p>(B) Any increase in surplus net of federal income tax resulting from arrangements described in subparagraph</p>
                <p>(A) of this paragraph shall be identified separately on the insurer's statutory financial statement as a surplus item with aggregate write-ins for gains and losses in surplus in the capital and surplus account, and recognition of the surplus increase as income shall be reflected on a net of tax basis in the "reinsurance ceded" line, of the annual statement as earnings emerge from the business reinsured.</p>
                <p>(c)(i) No reinsurance agreement or amendment to any agreement shall be used to reduce any liability or to establish any asset in any financial statement filed with the department, unless the agreement, amendment or a binding letter of intent has been duly executed by both parties no later than the "as of date" of the financial statement;</p>
                <p>(ii) In the case of a letter of intent, a reinsurance agreement or an amendment to a reinsurance agreement must be executed within a reasonable period of time, not exceeding ninety (90) days from the execution date of the letter of intent, in order for credit to be granted for the reinsurance ceded;</p>
                <p>(iii) The reinsurance agreement shall contain provisions which provide that:</p>
                <p>(A) The agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the business being reinsured thereunder and that there are no understandings between the parties other than as expressed in the agreement; and</p>
                <p>(B) Any change or modification to the agreement shall be null and void unless made by amendment to the agreement and signed by both parties.</p>
                <p>(d) Insurers subject to this section shall reduce to zero (0) by December 31, 1995 any reserve credits or assets established with respect to reinsurance agreements entered into prior to April 1, 1994 which, under the provisions of this section would not be entitled to recognition of the reserve credits or assets, provided, however, that the reinsurance agreements shall have been in compliance with laws or regulations in existence immediately preceding the effective date of this section.</p>
                <p>(e) The commissioner may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations and issue orders necessary to implement the provisions of this section.</p>

Without limiting the general purport of this provision, reinsurance of any substantial part of the insurer's outstanding risks contracted for in fact within four (4) months prior to the date of a financial statement and cancelled after the date of that statement, or reinsurance under which the reinsurer bears no substantial insurance risk or chance of net loss to itself, is prima facie evidence of an arrangement principally for the purpose of deception.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner, after a hearing thereon, shall disallow as an insurer's asset any deposit, funds or other assets he finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) Not to be in good faith the insurer's property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Not freely subject to the insurer's withdrawal or liquidation at any time for the payment or discharge of claims or other obligations arising under its policies; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) To be resulting from arrangements made principally for the purpose of deception as to the insurer's financial condition on the date of any financial statement of the insurer.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner may suspend or revoke the certificate of authority of any insurer which has knowingly been a party to any actual or attempted deception.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-6-202. Annual valuation of reserves required; minimum standard valuation; other valuations accepted; conditions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual shall be governed by the following provisions:</p>
                  <p>(i) The commissioner, annually, shall value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (or reserves) for all outstanding life insurance policies and annuity and pure endowment contracts of any authorized life insurer issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual. The commissioner may use group methods and approximate averages for fractions of a year or otherwise in calculating reserves. In the case of an alien insurer, the valuation is limited to its United States business;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Instead of the valuation of reserves required of any foreign or alien insurer, the commissioner may accept any valuation from the insurance supervisory official of any state or other jurisdiction if that valuation complies with the minimum standard provided in this article;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The commissioner may accept the valuation made by any domestic life insurer upon satisfactory proof of its correctness and compliance with W.S. 26-6-208;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The provisions set forth in W.S. 26-6-203 and 26-6-205 through 26-6-207 shall apply to all policies and contracts, as appropriate, subject to this article prior to the operative date of the valuation manual and the provisions set forth in W.S. 26-6-209 and 26-6-210 shall not apply to the policies and contracts.</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed by Laws 2017, ch. 67, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any insurer which adopts any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this article, with the commissioner's approval, may adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum standard. For the purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by W.S. 26-6-208 shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.</p>
                  <p>(d) Reserves for any category of policies, contracts or benefits as the commissioner establishes, may at the insurer's option, be calculated according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for the category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this article. However, the rates of interest used for policies and contracts other than annuity and pure endowment contracts shall not be greater than the corresponding rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided in the policies and contracts.</p>
                  <p>(e) Policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual shall be governed by the following provisions:</p>
                  <p>(i) The commissioner shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (or reserves) for all outstanding life insurance contracts, annuity and pure endowment contracts, accident and health contracts, and deposit type contracts of any authorized life insurer issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual. In the case of an alien insurer, the valuation is limited to its United States business;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Instead of the valuation of reserves required of any foreign or alien insurer, the commissioner may accept any valuation from the insurance supervisory official of any state or other jurisdiction if that valuation complies with the minimum standard provided in this article;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The commissioner may accept the valuation made by any domestic life insurer upon satisfactory proof of its correctness and compliance with W.S. 26-6-208;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The provisions set forth in W.S. 26-6-209 and 26-6-210 shall apply to all policies and contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual.</p>

                  <p>(a) If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any insurer on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve for the policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to:</p>
                  <p>(i) The mortality table, rate of interest and method actually used for the policy or contract; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium with the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this section are the standards stated in W.S. 26-6-205(b) and 26-6-206(b). However, for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1998 for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than such excess premium, the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall be applied as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in W.S. 26-6-205(c)(i). The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with W.S. 26-6-205(c) and (d), and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(i) For the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided by those policies, over the then present value of any future modified net policy premiums. The modified net premiums for any such policy shall be a uniform percentage of the contract premiums for the benefits such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided by the policy and the excess of (1) over (2) as follows: (1) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided after the first policy year, divided by the present value at the date of issue, of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on each policy anniversary on which a premium falls due. The net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen (19) year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one (1) year higher than the age at issue of the policy; (2) A net one (1) year term premium for benefits provided in the first policy year;</p>

                  <p>(A) The value defined in subdivision (1) of paragraph (i) of this subsection being reduced by fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of such excess first year premium;</p>

                  <p>(d) Reserves according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method for benefits provided by the following policies or contracts shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of subsection (c) of this section:</p>

                  <p>(ii) Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement or deferred compensation plan established or maintained by an employer, an employee organization or both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by other annuity and pure endowment contracts.</p>
                  <p>(e) This section applies to annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement or deferred compensation plan established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, an employee organization, or both, and other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code. Reserves according to the commissioners' annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding disability and accidental death benefits in those contracts, shall be the greatest of the excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of any future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, provided by those contracts at the end of each contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations required by the terms of the contract that are payable prior to the end of the contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table and the interest rates specified in the contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the gross considerations applied under the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.</p>
                  <p>(f) No insurer's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, shall be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the method set forth in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (h) of this section and W.S. 26-6-203, and the mortality tables and rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for those policies. In no event shall the aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts and benefits be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by W.S. 26-6-208.</p>
                  <p>(g) Repealed by Laws 1994, ch. 76, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(h) For any plan of life insurance which provides that the amounts of future premiums will be determined by the insurance company based on the then estimates of future experience or which is of a nature that minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section and W.S. 26-6-203, the commissioner shall promulgate regulations for determining the reserves so they are:</p>
                  <p>(i) Appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Computed by a method which is consistent with the principles of this article.</p>

                  <p>(B) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options;</p>
                  <p>I = .03 + W (R - .03)</p>
                  <p>Where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this subsection, and W is the weighting factor defined in this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(C) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the formula for life insurance stated in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten (10) years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph</p>
                  <p>(B) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten (10) years or less;</p>
                  <p>(D) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply;</p>
                  <p>(E) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply.</p>
                  <p>(iii) However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half percent (1/2%), the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 (using the reference interest rate defined for 1979) and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when W.S. 26-16-209 becomes operative;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated above are given in the following tables:</p>
                  <p>(A) Weighting factors for life insurance:</p>
                  <p>GUARANTEE WEIGHTING DURATION FACTORS</p>
                  <p>(YEARS) 10 or less .50 More than 10, but not more than 20 .45 More than 20 .35 For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values or both which are guaranteed in the original policy;</p>
                  <p>(B) Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:</p>

                  <p>(IV) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration in excess of twenty (20) years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to commence;</p>
                  <p>(V) Plan type as used in the tables in this subparagraph is defined as follows:</p>
                  <p>Plan Type A: At any time policyholder may withdraw funds only (1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five (5) years or more, or (3) as an immediate life annuity, or (4) no withdrawal permitted.</p>
                  <p>Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only (1) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or assets values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or (2) without such adjustment but in installments over five (5) years or more, or (3) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without such adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five (5) years.</p>
                  <p>Plan Type C: Policyholder may withdraw funds before expiration of interest rate guarantee in a single sum or installments over less than five (5) years either without adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, or subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.</p>
                  <p>(VI) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract, and the change in fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.</p>
                  <p>(v) The reference interest rate referred to in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subsection shall be defined as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) For life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six (36) months and the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</p>
                  <p>(B) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</p>
                  <p>(C) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a year of issue basis, except as stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, with guarantee duration in excess of ten (10) years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six (36) months and the average over a period of twelve (12) months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;</p>

                  <p>(a) The commissioner may, by rule or regulation, require that any bond or other evidence of debt held by an insurer be valued in accordance with the most recent published valuation standards of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Any bonds or other evidences of debt as to which the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has not published valuation standards in its valuations of securities manual, if amply secured and not in default as to principal or interest, shall be valued as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If purchased at par, at the par value;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If purchased above or below par, on the basis of the purchase price adjusted so as to bring the value to par at maturity and so as to yield in the meantime the effective rate of interest at which the purchase was made, or instead of this method, according to an accepted method of valuation the commissioner approves;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Purchase price shall in no case be taken at a higher figure than the actual fair value at the time of acquisition regardless of how acquired, plus actual brokerage, transfer, postage or express charges paid in the acquisition of the securities;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Unless otherwise provided by valuation the commissioner establishes or approves, no such security shall be carried at above the call price for the entire issue during any period within which the security may be called.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner has full discretion in determining the method of calculating values according to the rules set forth in this section.</p>

At the commissioner's discretion, securities as to which the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has not published valuation standards shall be valued at their fair value, or at their appraised value or at prices the commissioner determines as representing their fair value.</p>
                  <p>(b) Preferred or guaranteed stocks or shares while paying full dividends may be carried at a fixed value instead of fair value at the commissioner's discretion and in accordance with a method of computation he approves.</p>
                  <p>(c) The stock of an insurer's subsidiary shall be valued on the basis of the value of only those assets of the subsidiary as would constitute lawful investments of the insurer if acquired or held directly by the insurer.</p>

                  <p>(b) Upon a domestic insurer's request, the commissioner shall return to the insurer the whole or any portion of its assets held on deposit if the commissioner is satisfied that the assets to be returned are not subject to liability and are not required to be longer held by any provision of law or purposes of the original deposit. If the insurer has reinsured all its outstanding risks in another insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state, the commissioner shall deliver the assets and securities to the insurer assuming the risks, upon the domestic insurer's written notice that the assets have been assigned and transferred to the reinsuring insurer. The notice shall be accompanied by a verified copy of the assignment or transfer.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner shall return any deposit made in this state by a foreign insurer, if that insurer ceases transacting insurance in this state and is not subject to any liability in this state for which the deposit was held.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the insurer is subject to delinquency proceedings as defined in W.S. 26-28-101, upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction the commissioner shall yield the insurer's assets held on deposit to the insurer's receiver, conservator, rehabilitator or liquidator, or to any other properly designated official who succeeds to the management and control of the insurer's assets.</p>
                  <p>(e) No release of deposited assets shall be made except upon application to and the written order of the commissioner. The commissioner has no personal liability for any release of any deposit or part thereof he makes in good faith.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, but subject to W.S. 26-24-129, a domestic insurer may deposit or arrange for the deposit of securities held in or purchased for its general account and its separate accounts in a clearing corporation. When securities are deposited with a clearing corporation, certificates representing securities of the same class of the same issuer may be merged and held in bulk in the name of the nominee of the clearing corporation with any other securities deposited with the clearing corporation by any person, regardless of the ownership of the securities, and certificates representing securities of small denominations may be merged into one (1) or more certificates of larger denominations. The records of any custodian through which an insurer holds securities in a clearing corporation, shall at all times show that the securities are held for the insurer and the accounts in which they are held. Ownership of, and other interests in, the securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of the clearing corporation without physical delivery of certificates representing the securities.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations governing the deposit by insurers of securities with clearing corporations, including establishing standards for national banks, state banks and trust companies to qualify as custodians for insurance company securities.</p>

                  <p>(b) The license of a business entity may be suspended, revoked or refused if the commissioner finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that an individual licensee's violation was known by one (1) or more of the partners, officers or managers acting on behalf of the business entity and the violation was neither reported to the commissioner nor corrective action taken.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner shall retain the authority to enforce the provisions of and impose any penalty or remedy authorized by this chapter and this code against any person who is under investigation for or charged with a violation of this chapter or this code even if the person's license or registration has been surrendered or has lapsed by operation of law.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commissioner may, after providing appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing as required in subsection (a) of this section, levy against any person against whom action has been taken by the commissioner the reasonable costs of investigation and administrative proceedings, not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).</p>

                  <p>(f) If an employer becomes aware that an employee who is engaged in the business of insurance needs the commissioner's consent to continue to engage in the business of insurance, the employer may direct the employee to obtain the necessary consent and, if the consent is denied, shall take action so that the employee is not engaged in the business of insurance. In cases arising under this subsection the commissioner shall give special weight to evidence, including statements from the employer, as to whether the employee has or has not engaged in any activity that relates to the offense requiring the written consent and that relates adversely to the insurance profession.</p>

                  <p>(b) An application for a license to act as an insurance consultant for hire shall be made to the commissioner on forms he prescribes.

The commissioner may waive written examination of a nonresident applicant if the applicant is licensed as a consultant in his home state, is in good standing in his home state and his home state grants this state's resident consultants a similar privilege. The commissioner may conduct investigations concerning the applicant's qualifications, residence, business affiliations and any other matter he deems necessary to determine compliance with this chapter or for the public's protection. The applicant shall provide the commissioner fingerprints and other information and permission necessary for a criminal history record background check as provided in W.S. 7-19-201(a).

                  <p>(d) All provisions of this chapter apply to licensees under this section to the extent that they are not in conflict with this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) This section does not apply to licensed attorneys.</p>

                  <p>(a) The commissioner shall not grant, renew, continue or permit to exist any license as an insurance producer if he finds that the license has been or is being used principally for the purpose of writing "controlled business" as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Insurance on his own interests or those of his family or of his employer; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Insurance or annuity contracts covering himself or members of his family, or the officers, directors, stockholders, partners or employees of a partnership, association or corporation of which he or a member of his family is an officer, director, stockholder, partner, associate or employee.</p>
                  <p>(b) A license is deemed to have been or intended to be used principally for the purpose of writing controlled business if the commissioner finds that during any twelve (12) month period the aggregate commissions earned from controlled business as specified in this section have exceeded or probably will exceed the aggregate commissions to be earned on other business written by an applicant or licensee during the same period.</p>
                  <p>(c) If commissions on controlled business transacted by an insurance producer payable in one (1) calendar year exceed the commissions on other insurance business transacted by the licensee and payable in the same year, the receipt of the excess commissions is an unlawful rebate.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section does not apply to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Insurance of the interest of:</p>
                  <p>(A) A motor vehicle sales or financing agency in a motor vehicle it sells or finances;</p>

The address of the place shall appear upon the license, and the licensee shall promptly notify the commissioner in writing of any change thereof as provided by W.S. 26-9-207(f). Nothing in this section prohibits maintenance of a place of business in the licensee's residence in this state.</p>
                  <p>(b) The licenses of an insurance producer under this chapter shall be conspicuously displayed in the place of business in a part thereof customarily open to the public.</p>

                  <p>(d) A limited lines producer for specialty limited lines shall not be required to treat monies collected from customers purchasing additional specialty limited lines insurance as funds received in a fiduciary capacity, provided that:</p>

Of the twenty-four (24) hours at least three (3) shall relate to ethical requirements. The requirements of this section do not apply to nonresident insurance producers, those persons who hold licenses for any kinds of insurance for which an examination is not required, nor shall they apply to any such limited or restricted licenses as the commissioner may exempt.</p>

                  <p>(b) Application under this section shall be made in accordance with W.S. 26-9-206, except business entity applicants applying for a specialty limited lines producer license shall be exempt from providing shareholders, officers and directors information. However, if the business entity derives more than fifty percent (50%) of its revenue from the sale of insurance, information shall be provided for all officers, directors and shareholders of record that have beneficial ownership of ten percent (10%) or more of any class of securities, who are subject to 15 U.S.C. 78p or subsequent similar federal enactment.</p>
                  <p>(c) An examination is not required for issuance of a specialty limited lines producer license nor is a licensee required to comply with continuing education requirements of W.S 26-9-231.</p>

                  <p>(g) An endorsee of the specialty limited lines producer that offers and disseminates specialty limited lines insurance on behalf of the licensed business entity and under the direction of a specialty limited lines insurance producer is not required to be individually licensed and is eligible to offer or disseminate specialty limited lines insurance if all of the following apply:</p>

Specialty limited lines producers that are billing and collecting these charges shall not be required to maintain these funds in a segregated account provided that the specialty limited lines producer is authorized by the insurer to hold these funds in an alternative manner. Specialty limited lines producers may receive compensation for billing and collection services.</p>

                <p>(c) The commissioner may issue an order of ineligibility if he finds or has reason to believe that the insurer:</p>

                <p>(ii) Has without just cause refused to pay claims arising under its contracts in the United States; or</p>

To qualify for inclusion on the list, the nonadmitted insurer shall annually file an application with the commissioner and any other appropriate information as required by the commissioner. This subsection does not obligate the commissioner to determine the actual financial condition or claims practices of any nonadmitted insurer.

Where the insurance covers properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed both in and out of Wyoming, the sum payable shall be computed based on:</p>

                <p>(h) The commissioner is authorized to utilize the allocation schedule included in the nonadmitted insurance multistate agreement for the purpose of allocating risk and computing the tax due on the portion of premium attributable to each risk classification and to each state where properties, risks or exposures are located.</p>

The service fee shall be paid by the insured.</p>

The fee shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Failure of an insurer to defend any such action is prima facie evidence that its failure to make payment was without reasonable cause.</p>

                  <p>(a) If within thirty (30) days following the giving of the notice specified in W.S. 26-12-302 the insurer has not ceased dissemination of any false advertising, and if the commissioner believes that the insurer is soliciting, issuing or delivering contracts of insurance to residents of this state or collecting premiums on those contracts or performing any other transaction in connection with that insurance, and that a proceeding by him in respect to those matters would be in the public interest, he shall take action against the insurer under W.S. 26-13-117.</p>
                  <p>(b) If pursuant to the proceeding the commissioner finds that the dissemination of false advertising is continuing, he shall order the insurer to desist therefrom and shall mail a copy of the order by certified or registered mail to the insurer at its principal place of business last of record with the commissioner and to the insurance supervisory official of the insurer's domiciliary state or province. Each violation after mailing of the desist order subjects the insurer to a penalty of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), to be recovered by a civil action the commissioner brings against the insurer. Service of process upon the insurer in the action may be made upon the commissioner pursuant to W.S. 26-12-202 and 26-12-203 or in any other lawful manner.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the commissioner finds that any person in this state, after a hearing in which the person is notified of the hearing and the charges against him, has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice defined in or prohibited under this chapter, the commissioner shall order the person to desist from the acts or practices.</p>
                  <p>(b) The desist order is final upon expiration of the time allowed for appeals from the commissioner's orders, if no appeal is taken, or, if there is an appeal, upon final decision of the court if the court affirms the commissioner's order or dismisses the appeal.

                  <p>(a) If the commissioner believes that any person in conducting an insurance business in this state is engaging in any method of competition or in any act or practice, not defined in this chapter, which is unfair or deceptive and that a proceeding by him in respect thereto would be in the public interest, after a hearing in which the person charged receives a notice of the hearing and of the charges against him, the commissioner shall make a written report of his findings of fact relative to the charges and serve a copy thereof upon the person and any intervenor at the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the commissioner's report charges a violation of this chapter and if the method of competition, act or practice is not discontinued, the commissioner, through the attorney general, at any time after service of the report, may cause an action to be instituted to enjoin and restrain the person from engaging in the method, act or practice. In the action the court may grant a restraining order or injunction upon any just terms, but the people of this state are not required to give security before the issuance of the order or injunction. If a stenographic record of the proceedings in the hearing before the commissioner is made, a certified transcript thereof including all evidence taken and the report and findings shall be received in evidence in the action.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the commissioner's report made under subsection (a) of this section or order on hearing made under W.S. 26-2-128 does not charge a violation of this chapter, then any intervenor in the proceedings may appeal within the time and in the manner provided in W.S. 26-2-129(b).</p>

                  <p>(g) A certificate of insurance is not a policy of insurance and does not affirmatively or negatively alter, amend or extend the coverage afforded by the policy to which the certificate of insurance makes reference.

                  <p>The purpose of this act is to assure that health insurance benefits not subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act are contractually guaranteed, and to avoid the conflict of interest that occurs when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority to decide what benefits are due. This act is also intended to assure that health insurance benefits contracts subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act which contain a discretionary clause provide appropriate disclosure of the clause and additional provisions to assure a fair determination of contract benefits. Nothing in this act shall be construed as imposing any requirement or duty on any person other than a health carrier.</p>

                  <p>This benefit plan contains a discretionary clause.

                <p>The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public and policyholders against the effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates by promoting price competition among insurers. The provisions in this chapter are intended to prohibit unlawful price fixing agreements by or among insurers and to authorize essential cooperative activities among insurers in the rate making process and to regulate these activities to prohibit practices that tend to substantially lessen competition or create monopolies. This chapter shall be liberally interpreted to carry into effect the provisions of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) As used in this chapter:</p>

                <p>(ii) "Competitive market" means any market except those which are noncompetitive pursuant to this chapter;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Excessive" means a rate that is likely to produce a long-term profit that is unreasonably high for the insurance provided. In a competitive market rates shall not be considered excessive;</p>
                <p>(iv) "Inadequate" means a rate which is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and the continued use of which endangers the solvency of the insurer using it or will have the effect of substantially lessening competition or creating a monopoly in any market;</p>
                <p>(v) "Joint underwriting" means an arrangement established to provide insurance coverage for a risk, pursuant to which two (2) or more insurers contract with the insured for a price and policy terms agreed upon between or among the insurers;</p>
                <p>(vi) "Market" means the statewide interaction between buyers and sellers in the procurement of a line of insurance coverage pursuant to the provisions of this chapter;</p>

                <p>(I) There are less than five (5) insurers actually issuing a particular line of insurance as determined by the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(II) Three (3) insurers transact more than ninety percent (90%) of the business;</p>
                <p>(III) Two (2) insurers transact more than eighty percent (80%) of the business; or</p>
                <p>(IV) There is reasonable evidence, as determined by the commissioner, of collusion among insurers in setting prices.</p>
                <p>(viii) "Pool" means an arrangement pursuant to which two (2) or more insurers participate in the sharing of risks on a predetermined basis. A pool may operate as an association, syndicate or in any other generally recognized manner;</p>
                <p>(ix) "Residual market mechanism" means an arrangement, either voluntary or mandated by law, involving participation by insurers in the equitable apportionment of risks among insurers for insurance which may be afforded applicants who are unable to obtain insurance through ordinary methods;</p>
                <p>(x) "Supplementary rate information" means any manual or plan of rates, classification, rating schedule, minimum premium, policy fee, rating rule and any other similar information needed to determine an applicable rate in effect or to be in effect;</p>
                <p>(xi) "Supporting information" means the experience and judgment of the filer and the experience or data of other insurers or organizations relied upon by the filer, the interpretation of any statistical data relied upon by the filer, a description of methods used in making the rates and other similar information relied upon by the filer;</p>
                <p>(xii) "Unfairly discriminatory" refers to rates that cannot be actuarially justified. It does not refer to rates that produce differences in premiums for policyholders with like loss exposures but different expenses, or like expenses but different loss exposures, so long as the rate reflects such differences with reasonable accuracy. A rate is not unfairly discriminatory if it averages broadly among persons insured under a group, franchise or blanket policy or a mass marketing plan. No rate in a competitive market shall be considered unfairly discriminatory unless it violates the provisions of W.S. 26-14-105(b) in that they classify in whole or in part on the basis of race, color, creed or national origin.</p>

                <p>(b) Risks may be classified in any way except that no risk may be classified in whole or in part on the basis of race, color, creed or national origin. In determining whether rates in a noncompetitive market are excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, consideration may be given to the following elements:</p>
                <p>(i) Basic Rate Factors.-Consideration may be given to past and prospective loss and expense experience within and outside of this state, to catastrophe hazards and contingencies, to events or trends within and outside of this state, to dividends or savings to policyholders, members or subscribers and to all other factors and judgments deemed relevant by the insurer;</p>
                <p>(ii) Classification.-Rates may be modified for individual risks in accordance with rating plans or schedules which establish standards for measuring probable variations in hazards or expenses, or both;</p>
                <p>(iii) Expenses.-The expense provisions shall reflect the operating methods of the insurer and, so far as credible, its own actual and anticipated expense experience; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Contingencies and Profits.-The rates may contain a provision for contingencies and a provision for a reasonable underwriting profit, and shall reflect investment income directly attributable to unearned premium and loss reserves.</p>
                <p>(c) Any insurer delivering or issuing for delivery in this state any new or renewal policy or contract of private passenger automobile liability or collision insurance or both, shall allow a reduction in premium charges of not less than ten percent (10%) to any insured who:</p>
                <p>(i) Is at least fifty-five (55) years of age;</p>
                <p>(ii) Successfully completes, at least every two (2) years, a motor vehicle accident prevention course meeting criteria the motor vehicle division approves, provided no person shall receive any premium reduction for a self-instructed course or a course which does not provide for actual classroom or field driving instruction for a minimum number of hours as the motor vehicle division approves; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Presents to the insurer a certificate or other evidence of successful completion of the course specified in this subsection.</p>

                <p>(a) Rates in a noncompetitive market, when regulated, shall be regulated in accordance with W.S. 26-14-105 through 26-14-108 applicable to noncompetitive markets.</p>
                <p>(b) The commissioner may regulate rates in an unregulated market if he determines that:</p>
                <p>(i) The unregulated market is a noncompetitive market; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Regulation will likely reduce rates for consumers in a total amount greater than the cost of regulation without substantially curtailing the availability of insurance in that market.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner may declare a noncompetitive market competitive if he determines the noncompetitive market no longer meets the conditions of a noncompetitive market as defined in W.S. 26-14-103(a)(vii).</p>
                <p>(d) To carry out the purpose of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the commissioner, upon his own motion, may conduct a rate or other investigation. The commissioner shall conduct a rate or other investigation upon request of:</p>
                <p>(i) Not less than ten percent (10%) of the insureds in any market;</p>
                <p>(ii) Any organization representing not less than ten percent (10%) of the insureds in any market; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Insurers selling at least thirty percent (30%) of the insurance in any market.</p>
                <p>(e) The commissioner shall not be compelled to conduct an investigation of any line of insurance pursuant to subsection</p>
                <p>(d) of this section more than once in any three (3) year period for any line of insurance but may do so.</p>
                <p>(f) As a part of any investigation under subsection (d) of this section the commissioner:</p>
                <p>(i) May require any insurer to submit actuarial and expense data relating to any line of insurance;</p>
                <p>(ii) May contract the services of an actuarial consultant and assess the cost thereof against the parties requesting the investigation or against the insurers affected if the investigation is conducted upon the commissioner's motion;</p>
                <p>(iii) Shall conduct a hearing upon not less than twenty (20) days written notice to affected parties, provided this requirement may be waived upon written agreement of the affected parties;</p>
                <p>(iv) Depending upon the availability of data and the existence of sufficient experience to allow for an actuarially sound determination, may base any regulation of rates for any line of insurance under this section on experience or loss data for that line of insurance in:</p>
                <p>(A) Wyoming alone;</p>
                <p>(B) Wyoming and selected other states with reasonably similar characteristics; or</p>
                <p>(C) The United States as a whole excluding states whose experience is atypical.</p>
                <p>(g) For rates regulated pursuant to subsections (a) and</p>
                <p>(b) of this section, there shall be a public hearing if within any twelve (12) month period an insurer requests approval of a base premium rate which when added to any other base premium rates pending or approved within that twelve (12) month period is twenty percent (20%) or more above the rate approved for the previous rating period. For health care professional malpractice insurance, a rate increase of more than twenty-five percent (25%) in any specialty shall cause a consolidated hearing on the rate increase. The informational hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days of the request for approval unless the commissioner delays the hearing for good cause. If the hearing is delayed the commissioner shall notify the insurer and any other person requesting notification of the reasons for the delay.</p>
                <p>(h) The following shall apply to any market found to be noncompetitive pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section and to any professional liability insurance for any health care provider licensed under title 33 of the Wyoming statutes:</p>
                <p>(i) The rate charged any individual insured shall not exceed the base rate approved by the commissioner for the insured's risk class by more than one hundred percent (100%), unless the commissioner has established for the applicable risk class a percentage limit of less than one hundred percent (100%);</p>
                <p>(ii) The rate charged an insured for extended reporting coverage following expiration, termination or nonrenewal of the insured's claims-made policy shall be subject to the following:</p>
                <p>(A) The rate shall be calculated according to a formula set forth in the insured's policy, which formula shall be subject to approval by the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(B) The formula shall be expressed as a percentage of the base rate for the insured's risk class or that insured's underwritten rate;</p>
                <p>(C) The percentage may be varied on a uniform basis for each risk class by the length of time during which the events covered by the extended reporting coverage may have arisen; and</p>
                <p>(D) If an individual elects to purchase the extended reporting coverage before the renewal date of his policy, the rates charged for the extended reporting coverage shall be computed based on the relevant rates for that insured before the renewal, not the rates that would be in effect upon renewal.</p>

                <p>(b) In noncompetitive markets, every insurer shall file with the commissioner all rates, supplementary rate information and supporting information for noncompetitive markets at least thirty (30) days before the proposed effective date. The commissioner may give written notice, within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the filing, that he needs additional time, not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date of the notice, to consider the filing. Upon written application of the insurer, the commissioner may authorize rates to be effective before the expiration of the waiting period or an extension thereof. A filing shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this chapter and to become effective unless disapproved pursuant to W.S. 26-14-108 by the commissioner before the expiration of the waiting period or an extension thereof. Residual market mechanisms or advisory organizations may file residual market rates. The filing shall be deemed in compliance with the filing provisions of this section unless the commissioner informs the insurer within ten (10) days after receipt of the filing as to what supplementary rate information or supporting information is required to complete the filing.</p>
                <p>(c) All information provided to the insurance commissioner under this chapter shall be open to public inspection. Copies may be obtained from the commissioner upon request and upon payment of a reasonable fee.</p>
                <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, upon written application of the insured, stating the reason therefor filed with the commissioner, a rate in excess of that otherwise applicable may be used on any specific risk.</p>

                <p>(a) The commissioner shall disapprove a rate for use in a noncompetitive market if he finds pursuant to subsection (b) of this section that the rate is excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.</p>
                <p>(b) Disapproval of rates by the commissioner shall be subject to the following procedures:</p>
                <p>(i) Prior to the expiration of the waiting period or an extension thereof of a filing made pursuant to W.S. 26-14-107(b), the commissioner may disapprove by written order rates filed pursuant to W.S. 26-14-107(b) without hearing. The order shall specify in what respects such filing fails to meet the requirements of this chapter. Any insurer whose rates are disapproved under this section shall be given a hearing upon written request made within thirty (30) days of disapproval;</p>
                <p>(ii) If at any time the commissioner finds that a rate applicable to insurance sold in a noncompetitive market does not comply with the standards set forth in W.S. 26-14-105, he may, after a hearing held upon not less than twenty (20) days written notice, issue an order in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, disapproving the rate. Such notice shall be sent to every insurer and rate service organization which adopted the rate and shall specify the matters to be considered at the hearing. The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the order.</p>
                <p>(c) If the commissioner disapproves a rate pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, he shall issue an order within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing specifying in what respects the rate fails to meet the requirements of this chapter. The order shall state an effective date no sooner than forty-five (45) business days after the date of the order when the use of the rate shall be discontinued. The order shall not affect any policy made before the effective date of the order.</p>

                <p>(a) No insurer or advisory organization shall attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize an insurance market in this state.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no insurer shall agree with any other insurer, rate service organization or advisory organization to adhere to or use any rate, supplementary rate information, policy surveys, inspections or similar material.</p>

Joint underwriting, pools and residual market mechanisms shall not be deemed rate advisory organizations.</p>
                <p>(b) If, after notice and hearing, the commissioner finds that any activity or practice of an insurer participating in a joint underwriting or pooling mechanism is unfair or unreasonable, or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions or purposes of this chapter, he may issue a written order specifying in what respects such activity or practice is unfair, unreasonable, anti-competitive or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter and require the discontinuance of such activity or practice.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-15-102. Life insurance upon individual or person in whom he has insurable interest; "insurable interest" defined.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any individual of competent legal capacity may procure or effect an insurance contract upon his own life or body for the benefit of any person. Except as provided in W.S. 26-15-103, no person shall procure or cause to be procured any insurance contract upon the life or body of another individual unless the benefits under the contract are payable to the individual insured or his personal representatives, or to a person having, at the time when the contract is made, an insurable interest in the individual insured.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the beneficiary, assignee or other payee under any contract made in violation of this section receives from the insurer any benefits thereunder accruing upon the death, disablement or injury of the individual insured, the individual insured or his executor or administrator, as the case may be, may maintain an action to recover the benefits from the person receiving them.</p>
                  <p>(c) "Insurable interest" as to personal insurance means that any individual has an insurable interest in the life, body and health of himself, and of other persons as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of individuals related closely by blood or by law, a substantial interest engendered by love and affection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life, health or bodily safety of the individual insured continue, as distinguished from an interest arising only by, or enhanced in value by, the death, disablement or injury of the individual insured; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) An individual party to a contract or option for the purchase or sale of an interest in a business partnership or firm, or of shares of stock of a closed corporation or of an interest in those shares, has an insurable interest in the life of each individual party to the contract and for the purposes of the contract only, in addition to any insurable interest which otherwise exists as to that individual's life.</p>
                  <p>(d) An insurer may rely upon all statements, declarations and representations made by an applicant for insurance relative to the applicant's insurable interest in the insured. No insurer incurs legal liability, except as set forth in the policy, by virtue of any untrue statements, declarations or representations relied upon in good faith.</p>

                  <p>(a) Contracts of life insurance may be made and entered into in which the person paying the consideration for the insurance has no insurable interest in the life of the person insured, if charitable, benevolent, educational or religious institutions are designated irrevocably as a beneficiary but not necessarily the primary beneficiary thereof.</p>
                  <p>(b) In making a contract as specified in subsection (a) of this section, the person paying the premium shall make and sign the application therefor as owner and shall designate a charitable, benevolent, educational or religious institution irrevocably as the beneficiary or one (1) of the beneficiaries of the policy. The application also shall be signed by the person whose life is to be insured.</p>
                  <p>(c) The contract is valid and binding among all of the parties thereto, notwithstanding that the owner has no insurable interest in the life of the person insured.</p>

                  <p>(a) No contract of insurance of property or of any interest in property or arising from property is enforceable as to the insurance except for the benefit of persons having an insurable interest in the things insured at the time of the loss.</p>
                  <p>(b) The measure of an insurable interest in property is the extent to which the insured might be directly or indirectly damnified by loss or impairment thereof.</p>
                  <p>(c) "Insurable interest" as used in this section means any actual, lawful and substantial economic interest in the safety or preservation of the subject of the insurance free from loss, destruction or pecuniary damage or impairment.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person of competent legal capacity may contract for insurance.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any minor not less than fifteen (15) years of age, notwithstanding his minority, may contract for or own annuities, or insurance, or affirm by novation or otherwise preexisting contracts for annuities or insurance upon his own life, body, health, property, liabilities or other interests, or on the person of another in whom the minor has an insurable interest. The minor, notwithstanding his minority, may exercise all rights and powers with respect to or under any contract for annuity or for insurance upon his own life, body or health, or any contract the minor effects upon his own property, liabilities or other interests, or any contract the minor owns or effects on the person of another, as might be exercised by a person of full legal age, and may at any time surrender his interest in any such contracts and give valid discharge for any benefit accruing or money payable thereunder. The minor, by reason of his minority, is not entitled to rescind, avoid or repudiate the contract, nor to rescind, avoid or repudiate any exercise of a right or privilege thereunder, except that such a minor not otherwise emancipated is not bound by any unperformed agreement to pay, by promissory note or otherwise, any premium on any such annuity or insurance contract.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any annuity contract or policy of life disability insurance procured by or for a minor under subsection (b) of this section, shall be made payable either to the minor or his estate or to a person having an insurable interest in the minor's life.</p>

                  <p>(a) No application for the issuance of any life or disability insurance policy or annuity contract is admissible in evidence in any action relative to the policy or contract, unless a true copy of the application is attached to or otherwise made a part of the policy or contract when issued. This provision does not apply to industrial life insurance policies.</p>
                  <p>(b) If any life or disability insurance policy delivered in this state is reinstated or renewed, and the insured or the policy beneficiary or assignee makes written request to the insurer for a copy of the reinstatement or renewal application, if any, the insurer, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the request at its home office, shall deliver or mail to the person making the request a copy of the application reproduced by any legible means. If the copy is not delivered or mailed after having been requested, the insurer is precluded from introducing the application in evidence in any action or proceeding based upon or involving the policy or its reinstatement or renewal. In the case of a request from a beneficiary, the time within which the insurer is required to furnish a copy of the application does not begin to run until after receipt of evidence satisfactory to the insurer of the beneficiary's vested interest in the policy or contract.</p>
                  <p>(c) As to insurance other than life or disability insurance, no application for insurance signed by or on behalf of the insured is admissible in evidence in any action between the insured and the insurer arising out of the policy so applied for, if the insurer fails, at expiration of thirty (30) days after receipt of written demand therefor by or on behalf of the insured, to furnish to the insured a copy of the application reproduced by any legible means.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any statements and descriptions in any application for an insurance policy or annuity contract, by or in behalf of the insured or annuitant, are representations and not warranties. Misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts and incorrect statements do not prevent a recovery under the policy or contract unless either:</p>
                  <p>(i) Fraudulent; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Material either to the acceptance of the risk, or to the hazard the insurer assumes; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The insurer in good faith, if it knew the true facts as required by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise, would not have:</p>
                  <p>(A) Issued the policy or contract;</p>
                  <p>(B) Issued it at the same premium rate;</p>
                  <p>(C) Issued a policy or contract in as large an amount; or</p>

                  <p>(a) No basic insurance policy or annuity contract form, or application form if written application is required and is to be made a part of the policy or contract, or printed rider or endorsement form or form of renewal certificate, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the form is filed with and approved by the commissioner or is approved as provided in W.S. 26-15-201. This provision does not apply to surety bonds, or to specially rated inland marine risks, nor to policies, riders, endorsements or forms of unique character designed for and used with relation to insurance upon a particular subject, or which relate to the manner of distribution of benefits or to the reservation of rights and benefits under life or disability insurance policies and are used at the request of the individual policyholder, contract holder or certificate holder. As to forms for use in property, marine, other than wet marine and transportation insurance, casualty and surety insurance coverages, the filing required by this subsection may be made by advisory and rating organizations on behalf of their members and subscribers. This provision does not prohibit any member or subscriber from filing the forms on its own behalf.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any filing shall be made not less than forty-five (45) days in advance of any delivery. At the expiration of forty-five (45) days the form filed is approved unless affirmatively approved or disapproved by the commissioner's order. Approval of any form by the commissioner constitutes a waiver of any unexpired portion of the waiting period. The commissioner may extend by not more than an additional forty-five (45) days the period within which he may affirmatively approve or disapprove any form, by giving notice to the insurer of the extension before expiration of the initial forty-five (45) day period. At the expiration of any extended period, and in the absence of prior affirmative approval or disapproval, any form is deemed approved. The commissioner, at any time, after notice and for cause shown, may withdraw any approval.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any order of the commissioner disapproving a form or withdrawing a previous approval shall state the grounds and the particulars for the withdrawal in such detail as to reasonably inform the insurer. The withdrawal of a previously approved form is effective at the expiration of the period the commissioner prescribes in the notice, but not less than thirty (30) days from the date of the notice.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commissioner, by order, may exempt from the requirements of this section for so long as he deems proper any insurance document or form or type thereof as specified in the order, to which, in his opinion:</p>
                  <p>(i) This section may not practicably be applied;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The filing and approval of which are not desirable or necessary for the public's protection; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The document or form or type thereof has been approved under the provisions of the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact as provided in W.S. 26-15-201.</p>
                  <p>(e) Appeals from the commissioner's orders disapproving a form or withdrawing a previous approval may be taken as provided in W.S. 26-2-125 through 26-2-129.</p>

                  <p>(a) The commissioner, within forty-five (45) days after filing of any insurance policy, shall disapprove any form filed under W.S. 26-15-110, or withdraw any previous approval thereof, only if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The form:</p>
                  <p>(A) Is in any respect in violation of or does not comply with this code;</p>
                  <p>(B) Contains or incorporates by reference, if the incorporation is otherwise permissible, any inconsistent, ambiguous or misleading clauses, or exceptions and conditions which deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the contract;</p>
                  <p>(C) Has any title, heading, or other indication of its provisions which is misleading; or</p>
                  <p>(D) Is printed or otherwise reproduced in such manner as to render any provision of the form substantially illegible; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) He finds that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The benefits provided in the policy are unreasonable in relation to the premiums charged; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The rates or classification are excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. This paragraph does not apply to any policy form for insurance except those lines of insurance deemed noncompetitive under W.S. 26-14-101 through 26-14-118.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the commissioner disapproves the insurance policy, the insurer may request a hearing pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Insurance contracts shall contain any standard or uniform provisions required by the applicable provisions of this code pertaining to contracts of particular kinds of insurance. The commissioner may waive the required use of a particular provision in a particular insurance policy form if:</p>
                  <p>(i) He finds the provision unnecessary for the insured's protection and inconsistent with the policy's purposes; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) He otherwise approves the policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) No policy shall contain any provision inconsistent with or contradictory to any standard or uniform provision used or required to be used, but the commissioner may approve any substitute provision which, in his opinion, is not less favorable in any particular to the insured or beneficiary than the provisions otherwise required.</p>
                  <p>(c) Instead of the provisions required by this code for contracts for particular kinds of insurance, substantially similar provisions required by the law of the domicile of a foreign or alien insurer may be used if the commissioner approves.</p>
                  <p>(d) A policy issued by a domestic insurer for delivery in another jurisdiction may contain any provision required or permitted by the laws of that jurisdiction.</p>

                  <p>(v) To exercise its rulemaking authority and designate products and advertisement that may be subject to a self-certification process without the need for prior approval by the commission;</p>

                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>Meetings and acts of the commission</p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this compact and the bylaws.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each member of the commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the commission. A member shall vote in person or by such other means as provided in the bylaws. The bylaws may provide for members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the bylaws.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VII</p>
                  <p>Rules and operating procedures: rulemaking functions of the commission and opting out of uniform standards</p>
                  <p>(a) Rulemaking authority. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.</p>
                  <p>(b) Rulemaking procedure. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission. Before the commission adopts a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard. The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.</p>
                  <p>(c) Effective date and opt out of a uniform standard. A uniform standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the commission or such later date as the commission may determine; provided, however, that a compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this article. "Opt out" shall be defined as any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated uniform standard. All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure or amendment.</p>
                  <p>(d) Opt out procedure. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the insurance department under the compacting state's administrative procedure act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by regulation, it must:</p>
                  <p>(i) Give written notice to the commission no later than ten (10) business days after the uniform standard is promulgated, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state. The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh:</p>
                  <p>(A) The intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this compact; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a compacting state may, at the time of its enactment of this compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long- term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in this compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.</p>
                  <p>(e) Effect of opt out is as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the state. If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under article XIV for withdrawals.</p>
                  <p>(f) Stay of uniform standard. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one (1) year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.</p>
                  <p>(g) Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule or operating procedure is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
                  <p>Commission records and enforcement</p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall promulgate rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets. The commission may promulgate additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission; provided, that disclosure to the commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement; and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, the commission shall not be subject to the compacting state's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The commission shall notify any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in article XIV.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state's law. The commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the following provisions:</p>
                  <p>(i) With respect to the commissioner's market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the compact except upon a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize the action. However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the commission's action on such requests.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IX</p>
                  <p>Dispute resolution</p>
                  <p>The commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this compact and which may arise between two (2) or more compacting states, or between compacting states and noncompacting states, and the commission shall promulgate an operating procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE X</p>
                  <p>Product filing and approval</p>
                  <p>(a) Insurers and third-party filers seeking to have a product approved by the commission shall file the product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the commission. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the insurance department in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to commission rules and operating procedures. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the commission shall promulgate rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such rules, the commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a product filing or supporting information.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any product approved by the commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XI</p>
                  <p>Review of commission decisions regarding filings</p>
                  <p>(a) Not later than thirty (30) days after the commission has given notice of a disapproved product or advertisement filed with the commission, the insurer or third-party filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the commission. The commission shall promulgate rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with article III, subsection (d).</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and advertisements subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this article.</p>
                  <p>Article XII Finance</p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the national association of insurance commissioners, compacting states and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third-party filer filing a product with the commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the commission's annual budget.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission's budget for a fiscal year shall not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in article VII of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission shall be exempt from all taxation in and by the compacting states.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any compacting state, except by and with the appropriate legal authority of that compacting state.</p>
                  <p>(f) The commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements of all funds under its control. The internal financial accounts of the commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its bylaws. The financial accounts and reports including the system of internal controls and procedures of the commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. Upon the determination of the commission, but no less frequently than every three (3) years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the commission. The commission shall make an annual report to the governor and legislature of the compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The commission's internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the commissioner of any compacting state upon request provided, however, that any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers' proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.</p>
                  <p>(g) No compacting state shall have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the commission or to any commission funds held pursuant to the provisions of this compact.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XIII</p>
                  <p>Compacting states, effective date and amendment</p>
                  <p>(a) Any state is eligible to become a compacting state.</p>
                  <p>(b) The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by two (2) compacting states; provided, the commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting uniform standards for, reviewing, and giving approval or disapproval of, products filed with the commission that satisfy applicable uniform standards only after twenty-six (26) states are compacting states or, alternatively, by states representing greater than forty percent (40%) of the premium volume for life insurance, annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance products, based on records of the national association of insurance commissioners for the prior year. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state.</p>
                  <p>(c) Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the commission and the compacting states unless and until all compacting states enact the amendment into law.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XIV</p>
                  <p>Withdrawal, default and termination</p>
                  <p>(a) Withdrawal shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact ("withdrawing state") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The commissioner of the withdrawing state shall immediately notify the management committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The commission shall notify the other compacting states of the introduction of such legislation within ten (10) days after its receipt of notice thereof;</p>
                  <p>(v) The withdrawing state is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state. The commission's approval of products and advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the withdrawing state, unless formally rescinded by the withdrawing state in the same manner as provided by the laws of the withdrawing state for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the effective date of the withdrawing state reenacting the compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) Default shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted ("defaulting state") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or duly promulgated rules or operating procedures, then, after notice and hearing as set forth in the bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact on the defaulting state shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the commission. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in commission rules. The commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the defaulting state's suspension pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Product approvals by the commission or product self-certifications, or any advertisement in connection with such product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the defaulting state in the same manner as if the defaulting state had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to subsection (a) of this article;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires a reenactment of the compact.</p>
                  <p>(c) Dissolution of the compact shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XV</p>
                  <p>Severability and construction</p>
                  <p>(a) The provisions of this compact shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.</p>
                  <p>(b) The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XVI</p>
                  <p>Binding effect of compact and other laws</p>
                  <p>(a) Other laws:</p>
                  <p>(i) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state, except as provided in paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For any product approved or certified to the commission, the rules, uniform standards and any other requirements of the commission shall constitute the exclusive provisions applicable to the content, approval and certification of such products. For advertisement that is subject to the commission's authority, any rule, uniform standard or other requirement of the commission which governs the content of the advertisement shall constitute the exclusive provision that a commissioner may apply to the content of the advertisement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action taken by the commission shall abrogate or restrict:</p>
                  <p>(A) The access of any person to state courts;</p>
                  <p>(B) Remedies available under state law related to breach of contract, tort, or other laws not specifically directed to the content of the product;</p>
                  <p>(C) State law relating to the construction of insurance contracts; or</p>
                  <p>(D) The authority of the attorney general of the state, including but not limited to maintaining any actions or proceedings, as authorized by law.</p>
                  <p>(iii) All insurance products filed with individual states shall be subject to the laws of those states.</p>
                  <p>(b) Binding effect of this compact:</p>
                  <p>(i) All lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and operating procedures promulgated by the commission, are binding upon the compacting states;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All agreements between the commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Upon the request of a party to a conflict over the meaning or interpretation of commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation in dispute;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by that provision upon the commission shall be ineffective as to that compacting state, and those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which those obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.</p>

The policy shall continue in full force during the grace period, which shall be counted from the premium due date specified in the policy. The insurer may impose an interest charge not to exceed six percent (6%) per annum for the number of days of grace elapsing before the payment of the premium, and, whether or not the interest charge is imposed, if a claim arises under the policy during the grace period the amount of any premium due or overdue, together with interest and any deferred installment of the annual premium, may be deducted from the policy proceeds.</p>

                  <p>(a) In participating policies, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy, provided the policy is in force and all premiums to that date are paid. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any dividend payable, at the option of the party entitled to elect the option, shall be either payable in cash or applied to any of the other dividend options provided by the policy. If any other dividend options are provided, the policy shall further state which option is automatically effective if the party does not elect some other option. If the policy specifies a period within which the other dividend option may be elected, the period shall be not less than thirty (30) days following the date on which the dividend is due and payable. The annually apportioned dividend is payable in cash within the meaning of the cash option specified in this subsection even though the policy provides that payment of the dividend is to be deferred for a specified period, provided the period does not exceed six (6) years from the date of apportionment and that interest will be added to the dividend at a specified rate.</p>
                  <p>(b) Renewable term policies of ten (10) years or less may provide that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The surplus accrued to the policies shall be determined and apportioned each year after the second policy year and accumulated during each renewal period;</p>
                  <p>(ii) At the end of the renewal period, on the insured's renewal of the policy, the insurer shall apply the accumulated surplus as an annuity for the next succeeding renewal term in reducing premiums.</p>
                  <p>(c) In participating industrial life insurance policies, instead of the provision required in subsection (a) of this section, there shall be a provision that beginning not later than the end of the fifth policy year, the policy shall participate annually in the divisible surplus, if any, in the manner set forth in the policy.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section does not apply to insurance issued in consideration of lapsed or surrendered policies.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Policy" includes certificates issued by a fraternal benefit society and annuity contracts which provide for policy loans;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Policyholder" includes the owner of the policy or the person designated to pay premiums as shown on the records of the life insurer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Policy loan" includes any premium loan made under a policy to pay one (1) or more premiums not paid to the life insurer when due;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Published monthly average" means:</p>
                  <p>(A) Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or any successor; or</p>
                  <p>(B) If the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates is no longer published, a substantially similar average established by regulation of the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(v) "The rate of interest on policy loans" authorized under this section includes the interest rate charged on reinstatement of policy loans for the period during and after any lapse of a policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) After three (3) full years premiums are paid and after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security of the policy, at a specified rate of interest, an amount equal to or at the option of the entitled party less than the policy's loan value. The policy loan value shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, provided that the insurer may deduct from the loan value or from the loan proceeds, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year.</p>
                  <p>(c) The policy may also provide that:</p>
                  <p>(i) If interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due, it shall be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the policy loan value, the policy terminates and is void after notice is mailed by the insurer within at least thirty (30) days to the last address of record with the insurer of the insured or other policy owner and of any assignee of record at the insurer's home office.</p>
                  <p>(d) The policy shall reserve the insurer's right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six (6) months after application. The provision shall also contain a table indicating in writing the loan values each year during the first twenty (20) years of the policy or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter.</p>
                  <p>(e) The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for automatic premium loan.</p>
                  <p>(f) This section does not apply to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Term policies;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Term insurance benefits provided by rider or supplemental policy provisions; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Industrial life insurance policies.</p>
                  <p>(g) Policies issued on or after July 1, 1983 shall provide for policy loan interest rates as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) A provision permitting a maximum interest rate of not more than eight percent (8%) per year; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) A provision permitting an adjustable maximum interest rate established from time to time by the life insurer as authorized by law.</p>
                  <p>(h) The rate of interest charged on a policy loan made under paragraph (g)(ii) of this section shall not exceed the higher of the published monthly average for the calendar month ending two (2) months prior to the date on which the rate is determined or the rate used to compute the cash surrender values under the policy during the applicable period plus one percent (1%) per year.</p>
                  <p>(j) The policy shall contain a provision stating the frequency at which the rate is to be determined for that policy. The maximum rate for each policy shall be determined at regular intervals at least once every twelve (12) months but not more than once every three (3) months. At the intervals specified in the policy:</p>
                  <p>(i) The rate charged may be increased if the increase determined under subsection (h) of this section increases the rate by one-half percent (1/2%) or more per year; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The rate charged shall be reduced if the reduction determined under subsection (h) of this section decreases the rate by one-half percent (1/2%) or more per year.</p>
                  <p>(k) The life insurer shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Notify the policyholder of the initial rate of interest on the loan at the time a cash loan is made;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Notify the policyholder of the initial rate of interest on a premium loan as soon as reasonably practical after making the initial loan. No notice is required if an additional premium loan is added except as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide policyholders having loans reasonable advance notice of any rate increase; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Include in notices to policyholders required by this subsection the substance of the pertinent provisions of subsections (g) and (j) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(m) The loan value of the policy shall be determined in accordance with W.S. 26-16-202(a)(vi). No policy shall terminate in a policy year as the sole result of a change in the interest rate during that policy year. The life insurer shall maintain coverage during that policy year until the time at which it would otherwise have terminated if there had been no interest rate change during that policy year.</p>
                  <p>(n) The substance of the pertinent provisions of subsections (g) and (j) of this section shall be stated within the policies to which they apply.</p>
                  <p>(o) No other provision of law shall apply to policy loan interest rates unless made specifically applicable to such rates.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the benefits under the policy are payable because of the death of the insured, settlement shall be made upon receipt of proof of death and, at the insurer's option, surrender of the policy or proof of the interest of the claimant, or both. If an insurer shall specify a particular period prior to the expiration of which settlement shall be made, the period may not exceed the time requirements specified in W.S. 26-15-124. For any private placement policy, settlement may be made in cash or, if allowed under the policy, by distributing assets of the separate account to the claimant with the consent of the policyholder, as long as the fair market value of the assets are independently verified at the time of disbursement by the insurer. In any private placement policy, the obligation of the insurer to settle that portion of the policy attributable to separate account assets is subject to the liquidity of the assets and the insurer shall settle the portion of the policy as and when the assets can be, by their respective terms, either converted to cash, which may be later than the time requirements specified in W.S. 26-15-124, or otherwise dispersible by the insurer.</p>
                  <p>(b) Benefits shall be paid within the time requirements of W.S. 26-15-124 and shall include interest accrued from the date of death until date of payment. The interest rate shall be not less than the rate of interest payable on death proceeds left on deposit with the insurer. For any private placement policy, the interest shall be computed commencing the latter of sixty (60) days succeeding the date of death of the insured or the date proof of death has been received by the insurer in good order, until the date of payment. In any private placement policy, the obligation of the insurer to pay interest on that portion of the policy attributable to separate account assets may only be computed as and when the assets are, by their respective terms, either converted to cash or otherwise dispersible by the insurer.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of this section, date of payment shall include the date of the postmark stamped on an envelope properly addressed and postage prepaid, containing the payment.</p>
                  <p>(d) The provisions of this section requiring the payment of interest shall not apply to variable contracts which provide for insurance or annuity benefits which may vary according to the investment experience of any separate account or accounts maintained by the insurer as to such contract.</p>
                  <p>(e) As used in this chapter, "private placement policy" is a variable life insurance policy that is:</p>
                  <p>(i) Issued exclusively to a person who is an accredited investor or a qualified purchaser, as defined in the Securities Act of 1933 or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or in regulations promulgated under either statute; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Offered for sale and sold in a transaction that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.</p>

                  <p>(a) An industrial life insurance policy shall have the name of the beneficiary designated thereon, or in the application or other form if attached to the policy, with a reservation of the right to designate or change the beneficiary after the issuance of the policy, unless the beneficiary is irrevocably designated.</p>
                  <p>(b) The policy may also provide that:</p>
                  <p>(i) No designation or change of beneficiary is binding on the insurer until endorsed on the policy by the insurer;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The insurer may refuse to endorse the name of any proposed beneficiary who does not appear to the insurer to have an insurable interest in the insured's life;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the beneficiary designated in the policy does not make a claim under the policy or does not surrender the policy with proof of death within the period stated in the policy, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the insured's death, or if the beneficiary is the estate of the insured, or is a minor, or dies before the insured, or is not legally competent to give a valid release, the insurer may make any payment thereunder to the insured's executor or administrator, or to any relative of the insured by blood or legal adoption or connection by marriage, or to any person appearing to the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto because of having been named beneficiary or having incurred expense for the insured's maintenance, medical attention or burial.</p>
                  <p>(c) The policy may also include a provision similar to that in paragraph (b)(iii) of this section applicable to any other payment due under the policy.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any annuity or pure endowment contract, other than a reversionary, survivorship or group annuity, shall contain provisions as specified in this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) There shall be a grace period of one (1) month, but not less than thirty (30) days, within which any stipulated payment to the insurer falling due after the first may be made, subject at the option of the insurer to an interest charge thereon at a rate to be specified in the contract but not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum for the number of days of grace elapsing before the payment. The contract shall continue in full force during the grace period. If a claim arises under the contract because of death prior to expiration of the grace period before the overdue payment to the insurer or the deferred payments of the current contract year, if any, are made, the amount of the payments, with interest on any overdue payments, may be deducted from any amount payable under the contract in settlement.</p>
                  <p>(c) If any statements, other than those relating to age, sex and identity, are required as a condition to issuing an annuity or pure endowment contract, and subject to subsection</p>
                  <p>(e) of this section the contract is incontestable after it is in force during the lifetime of the person or of each of the persons as to whom the statements are required, for a period of two (2) years from its date of issue, except for nonpayment of stipulated payments to the insurer. At the insurer's option the contract may also except any provisions relative to benefits in case of disability and any provisions which grant insurance specifically against death by accident or accidental means.</p>
                  <p>(d) The contract constitutes the entire contract between the parties, or if a copy of the application is endorsed upon or attached to the contract when issued, the contract and the application therefor constitute the entire contract between the parties.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the age or sex of any person upon whose life the contract is made is misstated, the amount payable or benefits accruing under the contract shall be in an amount as the stipulated payment to the insurer would purchase according to the correct age or sex. If the insurer overpays because of any such misstatement, the amount of overpayment with interest at the rate to be specified in the contract, but not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum, may be charged against the current or next succeeding payment the insurer makes under the contract.</p>
                  <p>(f) In a participating contract the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion any divisible surplus accruing on the contract.</p>
                  <p>(g) The contract may be reinstated at any time within one (1) year from the default in making stipulated payments to the insurer, unless the cash surrender value has been paid. Any overdue stipulated payments and any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract shall be paid or reinstated with interest thereon at a rate to be specified in the contract but not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum payable annually. In applicable cases the insurer may also require evidence of insurability to its satisfaction.</p>

                  <p>(b) A policy which contains any exclusion or restriction pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall also provide that in case of death under the circumstances to which the exclusion or restriction applies, the insurer shall pay an amount not less than a reserve determined according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method upon the basis of the mortality table and interest rate specified in the policy for the calculation of nonforfeiture benefits, or if the policy does not provide for such benefits, computed according to a mortality table and interest rate determined by the insurer and specified in the policy, with adjustment for indebtedness or dividend credit.</p>

                  <p>(i) By which the policy purports to be issued or to take effect more than one (1) year before the original application for the insurance is made, if thereby the insured would rate at an age more than one (1) year younger than his insuring age at date when application is made;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For any mode of settlement at maturity of the policy of less value than the amount insured under the policy, plus dividend additions, if any, less any indebtedness to the insurer on or secured by the policy and less any premium that, by the terms of the policy, may be deducted. This paragraph does not apply to any nonforfeiture provisions which employ the cash value less indebtedness, if any, to purchase automatic paid-up or extended insurance, nor does it apply to graded death benefits in juvenile policies at ages one (1) to sixteen (16) years.</p>

                  <p>(B) Has been rejected for insurance, unless the right is conditioned upon the insurer showing that knowledge of the rejection would have led to the insurer's refusal to make the contract.</p>

                  <p>(i) In case of default in any premium payment the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of the due date, in an amount as is specified in this article. Instead of the stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer, upon proper request not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of the premium in default, may substitute an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Upon surrender of the policy within sixty (60) days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three (3) full years in the case of ordinary insurance or five (5) full years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, instead of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value in an amount as is specified in this article;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit is effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make the election elects another available option not later than sixty (60) days after the due date of the premium in default;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If the policy is paid-up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer, upon surrender of the policy within thirty (30) days after any policy anniversary, will pay a cash surrender value in an amount as is specified in this article;</p>
                  <p>(v) In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate and method of use in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits under the policy. All other policies shall contain a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first twenty (20) policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, those values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A statement:</p>
                  <p>(A) That the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered;</p>
                  <p>(B) Explaining the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy;</p>
                  <p>(C) That the method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered, if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated in the policy; and</p>
                  <p>(D) Of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which the values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any provision or part thereof set forth in paragraphs (a)(i) through (vi) of this section, not applicable by reason of the insurance plan, to the extent inapplicable, may be omitted from the policy.</p>

                  <p>(a) The insurer may reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six (6) months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) Cash surrender value shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any cash surrender value available under the policy in case of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by W.S. 26-16-202, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on the anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits, including any existing paid-up additions, which would have been provided for by the policy if there had been no default, over the sum of:</p>
                  <p>(A) The then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in W.S. 26-16-205 through 26-16-209 corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after the anniversary; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.</p>
                  <p>(ii) For any policy issued on or after the operative date of W.S. 26-16-209, which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the insured's option and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in that paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in that paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by the rider or supplemental policy provision;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For any family policy issued on or after the operative date of W.S. 26-16-209, which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age seventy-one (71), the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in that paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in the paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by the term insurance on the life of the spouse;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any cash surrender value available within thirty (30) days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid-up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by W.S. 26-16-202(a), shall be an amount not less than the present value, on the anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.</p>

                  <p>(b) Except as provided in W.S. 26-16-207, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding any extra premiums charged because of impairment or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided by the policy;</p>

                  <p>(iii) of this subsection and this paragraph, no adjusted premium is deemed to exceed four percent (4%) of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto.</p>

                  <p>(a) In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of W.S. 26-16-205 is the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-16-208. Section applicability; calculation of certain adjusted premiums.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) This section does not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of W.S. 26-16-209. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this article, for all policies of ordinary insurance, shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners' 1958 standard ordinary mortality table, except that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six (6) years younger than the insured's actual age.</p>
                  <p>(b) Calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the commissioners' 1961 standard industrial mortality table.</p>
                  <p>(c) All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits. The rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half percent (3 1/2%) per annum, except that a rate of interest not exceeding four percent (4%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1975 and prior to May 20, 1981 and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half percent (5 1/2%) per annum may be used for policies issued on or after May 20, 1981.</p>
                  <p>(d) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners' 1958 extended term insurance table in the case of ordinary insurance, and the commissioners' 1961 industrial extended term insurance table in the case of industrial policies.</p>
                  <p>(e) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on any mortality table the insurer specifies and the commissioner approves.</p>

                  <p>(a) This section applies to policies issued on or after the operative date in subsection (n) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be the uniform percentage of the premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding:</p>
                  <p>(i) Amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:</p>
                  <p>(A) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided by the policy;</p>
                  <p>(B) One percent (1%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years; and</p>
                  <p>(C) One hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the nonforfeiture net level premium as otherwise defined in this section. In applying this percentage, no nonforfeiture net level premium is deemed to exceed four percent (4%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years.</p>
                  <p>(D) Repealed By Laws 2011, Ch. 176, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(c) The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each policy anniversary on which a premium falls due.</p>
                  <p>(d) For policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of policy issue. At the time of any such change in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be the uniform percentage of the future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all the future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of: The sum of the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and the additional expense allowance, if any, over the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.</p>
                  <p>(f) The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of:</p>
                  <p>(i) One percent (1%) of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years after the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years after the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) One hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.</p>
                  <p>(g) The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing (i) by (ii) where:</p>
                  <p>(i) Equals the sum of:</p>
                  <p>(A) The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or after the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Equals the present value of an annuity of one (1) per annum payable on each policy anniversary on or after the date of change on which a premium falls due.</p>
                  <p>(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, for a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated as if the policy were issued to provide the higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.</p>
                  <p>(j) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this article shall be calculated for all policies of ordinary insurance on the basis of the commissioners' 1980 standard ordinary mortality table or, at the election of the company for any one (1) or more specified life insurance plans, the commissioners' 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with ten-year select mortality factors; for all industrial insurance policies on the basis of the commissioners' 1961 standard industrial mortality table; and for all policies issued in a particular calendar year on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this section for policies issued in that calendar year, except that:</p>
                  <p>(i) At the insurer's option, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in this subsection, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by W.S. 26-16-202(a), shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of the paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate not lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed shall not be more than those shown in the commissioners' 1980 extended term insurance table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the commissioners' 1961 industrial extended term insurance table for policies of industrial insurance;</p>
                  <p>(v) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of the adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables specified in this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners' standard ordinary mortality tables the NAIC adopts after 1980, that are approved by regulation the commissioner promulgates, for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard, may be substituted for the commissioners' 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners' 1980 extended term insurance table;</p>
                  <p>(vii) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners' standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners' 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners' 1980 extended term insurance table. If the commissioner approves by regulation any commissioners' standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual;</p>
                  <p>(viii) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners' standard industrial mortality tables the NAIC adopts after 1980, that are approved by regulation the commissioner promulgates, for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard, may be substituted for the commissioners' 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners' 1961 industrial extended term insurance table;</p>
                  <p>(ix) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners' standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners' 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners' 1961 industrial extended term insurance table. If the commissioner approves by regulation any commissioners' standard industrial mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.</p>
                  <p>(k) The nonforfeiture interest rate is defined as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year is equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the standard valuation law rounded to the nearer one-fourth percent (1/4%), provided the nonforfeiture interest rate shall not be less than four percent (4%);</p>
                  <p>(ii) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.</p>
                  <p>(m) Notwithstanding any other provision in this code to the contrary, any refiling or nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.</p>
                  <p>(n) After the effective date of this section, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this section after a specified date before January 1, 1989, and the date specified is the operative date of this section for the insurer, except that if an insurer does not make the election, the operative date of this section for the insurer is January 1, 1989. Before that date the election may be made on a product-by-product basis.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-16-210. Determination of specified life insurance plan premiums and benefits.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) For any life insurance plan which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on the then estimates of future experience, or for any life insurance plan which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in W.S. 26-16-202 through 26-16-209, the commissioner shall be satisfied that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by W.S. 26-16-202 through 26-16-209;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds.</p>
                  <p>(b) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan shall not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this article for life insurance, as determined by regulations the commissioner promulgates.</p>
                  <p>(c)(i) This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, applies to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years, from the sum of (A) the greater of zero and the basic cash value as specified in this subsection and (B) the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as specified in paragraph (iii) of this subsection, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary. However, the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in W.S. 26-16-203 or 26-16-207, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in W.S. 26-16-203 or 26-16-207, whichever is applicable on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in W.S. 26-16-205, 26-16-206 and 26-16-207 or in W.S. 26-16-209, whichever is applicable. Except as is required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, such percentage:</p>
                  <p>(A) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of (1) the fifth policy anniversary and (2) the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one percent (.2%) of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten (10) policy years; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two (2) policy anniversaries specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may apply to fewer than five (5) consecutive policy years.</p>
                  <p>(iv) No basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in W.S. 26-16-205, 26-16-206 and 26-16-207 or in W.S. 26-16-209, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value;</p>
                  <p>(v) All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection, for a particular policy, shall be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in W.S. 26-16-202, 26-16-203, 26-16-204, 26-16-209, and 26-16-211. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as paragraphs (i) through (vi) of this subsection shall conform with the principals of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available under the policy in case of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in W.S. 26-16-203(b) through 26-16-209 may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall not be less than the amounts used to provide the additions. Notwithstanding W.S. 26-16-203(b), the following additional benefits payable shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this article and are not required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits:</p>
                  <p>(i) In case of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In case of total and permanent disability;</p>
                  <p>(iii) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;</p>
                  <p>(iv) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply;</p>
                  <p>(v) As term insurance on the life of a child provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if the term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six (26), is uniform in amount after the child's age is one (1) and is not paid-up because of the death of a parent of the child; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all the additional benefits.</p>

                  <p>(a) In the case of policies referred to in W.S. 26-16-102 and issued prior to the operative date of article 2 of this chapter, there shall be a provision which, in case of default in premium payments after premiums are paid for three (3) years, shall secure to the policy owner, as a nonforfeiture benefit, a stipulated form of insurance, the net value of which is at least equal to the minimum life insurance reserve at the date of the default on the policy and on any dividend addition thereto, as required by article 2 of chapter 6 of this code, less a sum not more than two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the amount insured by the policy and of any existing dividend additions thereto, and less any existing indebtedness to the insurer on or secured by the policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) The net value specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be determined on the basis of a mortality table and rate of interest stated in the policy and acceptable for the valuation of the policy pursuant to the standard valuation law, except that if the mortality table is a more modern table than the American experience table of mortality, a mortality rate not more than one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the mortality rate according to the more modern table may be used in calculating any extended insurance, with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit. If the mortality table used as the basis of determining the net value is the commissioners' 1958 standard ordinary mortality table, the mortality rates to be assumed in calculating any extended insurance, with accompanying pure endowment, if any, shall not be more than those shown in the commissioners' 1958 extended term insurance table.</p>
                  <p>(c) The provision specified in subsection (a) of this section shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Stipulate that the policy may be surrendered to the insurer at its home office within one (1) month from date of default, for a specified cash value equal to the sum which would otherwise be available for the purchase of insurance as specified in subsection (a) of this section, and may stipulate that the insurer may defer payment for not more than six (6) months after the application therefor is made;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Contain a table showing the options available under the policy each year upon default in premium payments during the first twenty (20) years of the policy, or during the term of the policy whichever is shorter;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Not be required in term insurances of twenty (20) years or less or in industrial life insurance policies.</p>

                  <p>(a) In the case of contracts issued on or after the operative date of this article as defined in W.S. 26-16-411, no annuity contract, except as stated in W.S. 26-16-402, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which the commissioner determines are at least as favorable to the contract holder, upon cessation of payment of considerations under the contract or upon the written request of the contract owner:</p>
                  <p>(i) The company shall grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of a value as is specified in W.S. 26-16-405 through 26-16-409;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that upon surrender of the contract at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the company shall pay instead of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit in an amount as is specified in W.S. 26-16-405, 26-16-406, 26-16-408 and 26-16-409, provided the company may reserve the right to defer the payment of the cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed six (6) months after demand therefore with surrender of the contract and after making written request and receiving the written approval of the commissioner. The request shall address the necessity and equitability to all policyholders of the deferral;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A statement of the mortality table and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of those benefits;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts the company credits to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract;</p>

                  <p>(a) The minimum values as specified in W.S. 26-16-405 through 26-16-409 of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in subsections (b) through (f) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be governed by the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to that time at rates of interest as provided in subsection (e) of this section of the net considerations paid prior to that time decreased by the sum of any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest provided in subsection (e) of this section, an annual contract charge of fifty dollars ($50.00), accumulated at rates of interest as provided in subsection (e) of this section, and any premium tax paid by the company for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as provided in subsection (e) of this section, and the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued.

                  <p>(i) The lesser of three percent (3%) per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:</p>
                  <p>(A) The five (5) year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the federal reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent (.05%), specified in the contract no longer than fifteen (15) months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under paragraph (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(B) Reduced by one hundred twenty-five (125) basis points.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (i) of this subsection, the resulting interest rate shall not be less than one percent (1%);</p>
                  <p>(iii) The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract. The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five (5) year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.</p>
                  <p>(f) During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in subparagraph (e)(i)(B) of this section by up to an additional one hundred (100) basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The commissioner may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. Lacking such a demonstration that is acceptable to the commissioner, the commissioner may disallow or limit the additional reduction.</p>
                  <p>(g) The commissioner may adopt rules to implement the provisions of subsection (f) of this section and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts that the commissioner determines are justified.</p>

                  <p>(i) Determine the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit which would be provided under the contract at maturity, arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender;</p>

                  <p>(iii) The amount determined in paragraph (ii) of this subsection shall be decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The amount determined in paragraph (iii) of this subsection shall be increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. In no case shall any cash surrender benefit be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under the contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.</p>

                  <p>For any contract which provides therein, by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that exceed the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding W.S. 26-16-405 through 26-16-409 additional benefits payable in case of total and permanent disability, as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits or as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all those additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits required by this article. The inclusion of the additional benefits is not required in any paid-up benefits, unless the additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.</p>

                  <p>(a) A domestic life insurer may establish one (1) or more separate accounts and may allocate to those accounts amounts, including without limitation proceeds applied under optional modes of settlement or under dividend options, to provide for life insurance or annuities and benefits incidental thereto, payable in fixed or variable amounts or both, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The income and any gains and losses from assets allocated to a separate account shall be credited to or charged against the account, without regard to the insurer's other income, gains or losses;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except as may be provided with respect to reserves for guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in paragraph (iii) of this subsection, amounts allocated to any separate account and accumulations thereon may be invested and reinvested without regard to any requirements or limitations prescribed by the laws of this state governing the investments of life insurance companies, and the investments in the separate accounts shall not be considered in applying the investment limitations otherwise applicable to the insurer's investments;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except with the commissioner's approval and under conditions he prescribes as to investments and other matters, which conditions shall recognize the guaranteed nature of the benefits provided, reserves for benefits guaranteed as to dollar amount and duration and funds guaranteed as to principal amount or stated rate of interest shall not be maintained in a separate account;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Unless the commissioner otherwise approves:</p>
                  <p>(A) Assets allocated to a separate account shall be valued at their market value on the date of valuation, or if there is no readily available market, then as provided under the terms of the contract or the rules or other written agreement applicable to the separate account;</p>
                  <p>(B) The portion, if any, of the assets of the separate account which are equal to the insurer's reserve liability with regard to the guaranteed benefits and funds referred to in paragraph (iii) of this subsection shall be valued in accordance with the rules otherwise applicable to the insurer's assets.</p>
                  <p>(v) The insurer shall own amounts allocated to a separate account under this section and shall not be nor hold itself out to be a trustee with respect to those amounts;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If and to the extent provided under the applicable contracts, that portion of the assets of any separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the insurer conducts;</p>
                  <p>(vii) No insurer shall sell, exchange or otherwise transfer its assets between any of its separate accounts, or between any other investment account and one (1) or more of its separate accounts unless:</p>
                  <p>(A) In case of a transfer into a separate account, the transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the contracts with respect to the separate account to which the transfer is made;</p>
                  <p>(B) The transfer, whether into or from a separate account, is made by a transfer of cash or by a transfer of securities having a readily determinable market value; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The commissioner approves the transfer of securities, provided the commissioner may approve other transfers among the accounts if, in his opinion, the transfers are not inequitable.</p>
                  <p>(viii) To the extent deemed necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state laws, the insurer, with respect to any separate account, including without limitation any separate account which is a management investment company or a unit investment trust, may provide for persons having an interest therein appropriate voting and other rights and special procedures for the conduct of the business of the account, including special rights and procedures relating to investment policy, investment advisory services, selection of independent public accountants and the selection of a committee, the members of which need not be otherwise affiliated with the insurer, to manage the business of the account.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any contract providing benefits payable in variable amounts delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall contain a statement of the essential features of the procedures the insurer is to follow in determining the dollar amount of the variable benefits. The contract under which the benefits vary to reflect investment experience, including a group contract and any certificate in evidence of variable benefits issued thereunder, shall state that the dollar amount will vary and shall contain on its first page a statement to the effect that the benefits thereunder are on a variable basis.</p>
                  <p>(c) No insurer shall deliver or issue for delivery within this state variable contracts unless it is licensed to do a life insurance or annuity business in this state, and the commissioner is satisfied that its condition or method of operation in connection with the issuance of the contracts will not render its operation hazardous to the public or its policyholders in this state. In this connection, the commissioner shall consider among other things:</p>
                  <p>(i) The insurer's history and financial condition;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The character, responsibility and fitness of the insurer's officers and directors; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The law and regulation under which the insurer is authorized in the state of domicile to issue variable contracts. The state of entry of an alien insurer is its place of domicile for this purpose. If the insurer is a subsidiary of an admitted life insurer, or affiliated with that insurer through common management or ownership, it may be deemed by the commissioner to have met the provisions of this subsection if either it or the parent or the affiliated insurer meets the requirements thereof.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner has sole authority to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Regulate the issuance and sale of variable contracts; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Issue reasonable rules and regulations appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except for W.S. 26-16-117(a), (b) and (g), 26-16-118 and article 2 of this chapter in the case of a variable annuity contract and W.S. 26-16-103, 26-16-108 through 26-16-110, 26-16-201 through 26-16-212 and 26-17-111 in the case of a variable life insurance contract and except as otherwise provided in this section, all pertinent provisions of this code apply to separate accounts and contracts relating thereto. Any individual variable life insurance contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall contain grace, reinstatement and nonforfeiture provisions appropriate to the contract. Any individual variable annuity contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall contain grace and reinstatement provisions appropriate to the contract. Any group variable life insurance contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall contain a grace provision appropriate to the contract. The reserve liability for variable contracts shall be established in accordance with actuarial procedures that recognize the variable nature of the benefits provided and any mortality guarantees.</p>

                  <p>(a) An insurer shall perform a comparison of its insureds' policies and retained asset accounts against a death master file on at least a semi-annual basis by using the full death master file once and thereafter using the death master file update files for future comparisons in order to identify potential matches of its insureds.</p>
                  <p>(b) Not later than ninety (90) days after a death master file match an insurer shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Complete and document a good faith effort to confirm the death of the insured or retained asset account holder against other available records and information; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Determine whether benefits are due in accordance with the applicable policy. If benefits are due in accordance with the applicable policy the insurer shall complete and document good faith efforts to locate the beneficiary. The insurer shall also provide the appropriate claims forms or instructions to the beneficiary to make a claim including the need to provide an official death certificate, if applicable under the policy.</p>
                  <p>(c) With respect to group life insurance, an insurer shall confirm the possible death of an insured pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) of this section when the insurer maintains at least the following information on those covered under a policy:</p>

Interest otherwise payable as required by law shall not be considered unclaimed property pursuant to W.S. 34-24-120(a).</p>

                  <p>(a) No disability insurance policy shall be delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this state unless it otherwise complies with this code and the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The entire money and other considerations therefor shall be expressed in the policy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The time when the insurance takes effect and terminates shall be expressed in the policy;</p>
                  <p>(iii) It shall purport to insure only one (1) person, except that a policy may insure, originally or by subsequent amendment, upon the application of an adult member of a family, who is deemed the policyholder, any two (2) or more eligible members of that family, including husband, wife, dependent children or any children under a specified age not exceeding nineteen (19) years and any other person dependent upon the policyholder;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The style, arrangement and overall appearance of the policy shall give no undue prominence to any portion of the text, and any printed portion of the text and any endorsements or attached papers shall be plainly printed in lightfaced type of a style in general use, the size of which shall be uniform and not less than ten (10) point with a lower case unspaced alphabet length not less than one hundred twenty (120) point;</p>
                  <p>(v) The "text" shall include all printed matter except the insurer's name and address, the policy name or title, the brief description, if any, and captions and subcaptions;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The exceptions and reductions of indemnity shall be set forth in the policy and, other than those contained in W.S. 26-18-105 through 26-18-127, shall be printed, at the insurer's option, either included with the benefit provision to which they apply or under an appropriate caption such as "Exceptions", or "Exceptions and Reductions", except that if an exception or reduction specifically applies to a particular policy benefit, a statement of that exception or reduction shall be included with the benefit provision to which it applies;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Each form, including riders and endorsements, shall be identified by a form number in the lower left-hand corner of the first page;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The policy shall not contain any provision purporting to make any portion of the insurer's charter, rules, constitution or bylaws a part of the policy unless that portion is set forth in full in the policy, except in the case of the incorporation of or reference to a statement of rates, classification of risks or short-rate table filed with the commissioner;</p>
                  <p>(ix) If issued or delivered on or after January 1, 1999, the policy shall provide a notice on the face of the policy of not less than fourteen (14) point bold type, as to the extent to which the policy includes comprehensive adult wellness benefits as defined in subsection (b) of this section. To insure that the disclosure has been made, the notice shall include space for the signature of the policyholder and the sales representative on the disclosure statement. The disclosure statement must be signed by the applicant and sales representative at the time of the policy application. No policy shall be represented as containing comprehensive adult wellness benefits unless the policy meets the criteria specified under subsection (b) of this section. If coverage is included, the notice shall make reference to the exact location within the policy where the level and extent of coverage is described in detail. If coverage is not included, the notice shall state that the policy does not contain comprehensive adult wellness benefits as defined by law. This statement shall also be placed in a prominent location on any materials used in representing the policy, including sales materials. The department of insurance shall prescribe the form and content of the notice required under this paragraph. This paragraph does not apply to any policy with a deductible of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more.</p>
                  <p>(b) As used in paragraph (a)(ix) of this section, "comprehensive adult wellness benefits" means benefits not subject to policy deductibles, which provide a minimum benefit equal to eighty percent (80%) of the reimbursement allowance under the private health benefit plan with a maximum of twenty percent (20%) coinsurance by the insured and which provide a benefit structure to the insured equal to a minimum of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per insured adult per calendar year, or a benefit structure of similar actuarial value to the insured. In addition, the benefits shall at minimum provide for testing procedures and for the examination of adult policyholders and their spouses for breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer and diabetes.</p>

                  <p>(i) This time limit shall not be so construed as to affect any legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during the initial three (3) year period, nor to limit the application of W.S. 26-18-118 through 26-18-121 in case of misstatement with respect to age or occupation or other insurance;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium until at least age fifty (50) or in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four (44), for at least five (5) years from its date of issue, may contain instead of the "time limit on certain defenses" provision of this section the following provision (from which paragraph (i) of this subsection may be omitted at the insurer's option) under the caption "Incontestable: After this policy is in force for a period of three (3) years during the insured's lifetime, excluding any period during which the insured is disabled, it is incontestable as to the statements contained in the application."</p>
                  <p>(b) "Except for the preexisting condition provision stated in this subsection, no claim for loss incurred or disability, as defined in the policy, shall be reduced or denied due to a preexisting condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss. This preexisting condition provision shall not exclude coverage for a period beyond twelve (12) months following the individual's effective date of coverage and shall only relate to conditions for which medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment was recommended or received during the six (6) months immediately preceding the effective date of coverage or as to a pregnancy existing on the effective date of coverage."</p>
                  <p>(c) In determining whether a preexisting condition provision applies to an insured or dependent, all private or public health benefit plans shall credit the time the person was previously covered by a private or public health benefit plan if the previous coverage was continuous to a date not more than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of the new coverage. In the case of a preexisting conditions limitation allowable in the succeeding carrier's plan, the level of benefits applicable to preexisting conditions or persons becoming covered by the succeeding carrier's plan during the period of time this limitation applies under the new plan shall be the lesser of:</p>

                  <p>(ii) The benefits of the prior plan.</p>

                  <p>(a) "Reinstatement: If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent authorized by the insurer to accept the premium, without requiring an application for reinstatement, reinstates the policy. If the insurer or the agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy shall be reinstated upon the insurer's approval of the application, or, lacking that approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of the conditional receipt unless the insurer previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of the application. The reinstated policy covers only loss resulting from an accidental injury sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to any sickness beginning more than ten (10) days after that date. In all other respects the insured and insurer have the same rights under the policy as they had immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed on or attached to this policy in connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of reinstatement."</p>
                  <p>(b) The last sentence of the provision in subsection (a) of this section may be omitted from any policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums:</p>
                  <p>(i) Until at least age fifty (50); or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of a policy issued after age forty-four (44), for at least five (5) years from its date of issue.</p>

The period of six (6) months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer because of the claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision. Delay in giving the notice does not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of six (6) months preceding the date on which the notice is actually given."</p>

This insurer may pay benefits to any insurer providing other valid coverage in case of overpayment by the insurer. Any such payment discharges this insurer's liability as fully as if the payment is made directly to the insured, his assignee or his beneficiary. If this insurer pays benefits to the insured, his assignee or his beneficiary, exceeding the amount payable if the existence of other valid coverage had been disclosed, this insurer has a right of action against the insured, his assignee or his beneficiary to recover the amount which would not have been paid had there been a disclosure of the existence of other valid coverage. The amount of other valid coverage which is on a provision of service basis shall be computed as the amount the services rendered would have cost in the absence of that coverage.</p>

The first period begins on the date when the first expense is incurred, and successive periods begin when an expense is incurred after expiration of a prior period, or, instead: 'Claim determination period' with respect to any covered persons means (insert calendar or policy period of not less than a month) during which allowable expense covered under this policy is incurred because of that person;</p>
                  <p>(iii) 'Overinsurance provision' means this provision and any other provision which may reduce an insurer's liability because of the existence of benefits under other valid coverage."</p>
                  <p>(d) The policy provisions specified in subsections (a) through (c) of this section may be inserted in all policies providing hospital, surgical, medical or major medical benefits. The insurer may make this provision applicable to either or both other valid coverage with other insurers and other valid coverage with the same insurer. The insurer shall include in this provision a definition of "other valid coverage" approved as to form by the commissioner. The term may include hospital, surgical, medical or major medical benefits provided by group, blanket or franchise coverage, individual and family-type coverage, Blue Cross-Blue Shield coverage and other prepayment plans, group practice and individual practice plans, uninsured benefits provided by labor-management trusteed plans, or union welfare plans, or by employer or employee benefit organizations, benefits provided under governmental programs, worker's compensation insurance or any coverage required or provided by any other statute, and medical payments under automobile liability and personal liability policies. Other valid coverage does not include payments made under third party liability coverage as a result of a determination of negligence, but an insurer may include a subrogation clause in its policy. As part of the proof of claim, the insurer may require the information necessary to administer this provision.</p>

                  <p>(i) 'Earned income', unless otherwise specified, means the greater of the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commences and his average monthly earnings for a period of two (2) years immediately preceding the commencement of that disability and does not include any investment income or any other income not derived from the insured's vocational activities;</p>
                  <p>(ii) 'Overinsurance provision' includes this provision and any other provision with respect to any loss-of-time coverage which may have the effect of reducing an insurer's liability if the total amount of loss-of-time benefits under all coverage exceeds a stated relationship to the insured's earnings."</p>
                  <p>(d) The provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section may be included only in a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which is payable for at least fifty-two (52) weeks, which is issued on the basis of selective underwriting of each individual application and for which the application includes a question designed to elicit information necessary either to determine the ratio of the total loss-of-time benefits of the insured to the insured's earned income or to determine that the ratio does not exceed the percentage of earnings, not less than sixty percent (60%), the insurer selects and inserts instead of the blank factor specified in this section. As part of the proof of claim, the insurer may require the information necessary to administer this provision. If the application indicates that other loss-of-time coverage is to be discontinued, the amount of the other coverage shall be excluded in computing the alternative percentage in the first sentence of the overinsurance provision.</p>
                  <p>(e) The policy shall include a definition of "valid loss-of-time coverage", which the commissioner approves as to form. The definition may include:</p>
                  <p>(i) Coverage provided by:</p>
                  <p>(A) Governmental agencies; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Organizations subject to regulation by insurance law and by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or of any other country or subdivision thereof.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Coverage provided for the insured pursuant to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Any disability benefits statute; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Any worker's compensation or employer's liability statute.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Benefits provided by labor-management trusteed plans, union welfare plans, employer or employee benefit organizations or by salary continuance or pension programs; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any other coverage the inclusion of which the commissioner approves.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any insurer selling an insurance policy pursuant to this article, and any plan approved under this article, shall satisfy actuarial standards and insurer solvency requirements set forth by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and adopted by regulation promulgated by the commissioner or as otherwise prescribed by regulation promulgated by the commissioner so long as the regulation is not inconsistent with NAIC standards.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any policy sold in Wyoming under the coverage and administrative laws and regulations of another state that are not covered by a guarantee association or similar association of that state shall be protected under the Wyoming Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act under Chapter 42 of this title.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner shall have the authority to determine whether an insurer satisfies the standards required by this section and shall not approve a policy or plan that he finds not in compliance with this section. The commissioner shall have the authority to determine whether the policies sold pursuant to this article continue to satisfy the requirements set forth in this section in the same manner as he does with an individual accident and sickness insurance policy approved pursuant to this code. The commissioner shall have the authority to suspend or revoke new sales of out-of-state policies if the laws and regulations of those states are determined to egregiously harm Wyoming residents. Upon suspension or revocation, the issuers of the out-of-state policies shall be required to notify in writing all affected Wyoming policyholders of the suspension or revocation determination by the commissioner.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-18-205. Multi-state consortium; reciprocity requirements.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The commissioner shall explore with other insurance commissioners the creation of a consortium of like-minded states that could establish rules of reciprocity for the approval of comprehensive individual medical and surgical health insurance policies among the participating states.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner shall solicit the thoughts and report a consensus, where one exists, of the other commissioners interested in creating a consortium of like minded states in establishing rules of reciprocity for the approval of health insurance policies. Issues to be considered include but are not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether the consortium should involve only high deductible individual policies, all comprehensive individual medical and surgical health insurance policies, both of these types of individual policies plus small group policies or all health insurance policies;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether insurers should be free to price differently among consortium states dependent on local health care costs and market conditions;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether a policy approved in a primary state shall be automatically available in all secondary states of the consortium, or available at the option of the insurer;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In areas where an associated preferred provider network is absent, whether sale of policies should be prohibited, disclaimers should be required or the sale of policies should be regulated only by market forces and conditions;</p>
                  <p>(v) The adequacy for a multi-state consortium of existing state laws on insurer financial solvency, guarantee funds and imposition and collection of premium taxes;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The authority of a secondary state to deal with customer complaints concerning a multi-state policy;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Whether and when an insurer selling a policy approved in a primary state must notify the commissioner of a secondary state that the insurer is marketing the policy in the secondary state;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Whether secondary state insurers, in order to sell competitive policies, may match any less restrictive primary state rules governing policies sold in the secondary state, and whether disclaimers to warn potential customers shall be required on policies and promotional materials in the secondary state;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Whether any of the issues identified in this subsection require the enactment of uniform laws in the consortium states;</p>
                  <p>(x) Estimated savings to customers from policy approval only in the primary state and from uniform or less restrictive policies across the consortium states;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Other issues deemed appropriate by the commissioners to implement a multi-state consortium.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner shall make an initial proposal that Wyoming recommends the rules of approval for reciprocity should include terms and conditions to protect customers similar to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) An issuer, with respect to a particular policy, may only designate one (1) state as its primary state with respect to all coverage it offers using that policy. An issuer may not change the designated primary state with respect to individual health insurance coverage once the policy is issued; provided, however, that a change in designation may be made upon renewal of the policy with approval of the policyholder. With respect to the designated primary state, the issuer shall be licensed and approved to be doing business in that state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of a health insurance issuer that is selling a policy in, or to a resident of, a secondary state, the issuer shall be licensed and approved to be doing business in that secondary state; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The covered laws of the primary state shall apply to individual health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in the primary state and policies sold in any secondary state. The coverage and issuer shall comply with these terms and conditions with respect to the offering of coverage in Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as provided in this section, a health insurance issuer with respect to its offer, sale, rating (including medical underwriting), benefit payment requirements, renewal and issuance of comprehensive individual medical and surgical health insurance coverage in Wyoming is exempt from any covered laws of Wyoming as the secondary state and any rules, regulations, agreements or orders sought or issued by the commissioner under or related to the covered laws to the extent that the laws would:</p>
                  <p>(i) Make unlawful or regulate, directly or indirectly, the operation of the health insurance issuer operating in Wyoming as a secondary state, except that the commissioner may require an issuer:</p>
                  <p>(A) To pay on a nondiscriminatory basis applicable premium and other taxes, including high risk pool assessments and other assessments which are levied on insurers and surplus lines insurers, brokers or policyholders under the laws of Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(B) To register with and designate the commissioner as its agent solely for the purpose of receiving service of legal documents or process;</p>
                  <p>(C) To submit to examinations of its financial condition in accordance with the policies and regulations established through the national association of insurance commissioners for accreditation of states to perform these examinations;</p>
                  <p>(D) To comply with an injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a petition by the commissioner acting pursuant to chapters 28 of this code, chapter 48 of this code or W.S. 26-34-122 or 26-34-123;</p>
                  <p>(E) To participate, on a nondiscriminatory basis, in any insurance insolvency guaranty association or similar association to which a health insurance issuer in the state is required to belong;</p>
                  <p>(F) To comply with any state law regarding fraud and abuse, except that if the state seeks an injunction regarding the conduct described in this subparagraph, the injunction shall be obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(G) To comply with any state law regarding unfair claims settlement practices; and</p>
                  <p>(H) To comply with the applicable requirements for external review procedures with respect to coverage offered in the state.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Discriminate against the issuer issuing insurance in both the primary state and in any secondary state.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a health insurance issuer:</p>
                  <p>(i) From terminating or discontinuing coverage or a class of coverage in accordance with the laws of the primary state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) From reinstating lapsed coverage; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) From retroactively adjusting the rates charged an insured individual if the initial rates were set based on material misrepresentation by the individual at the time of issue.</p>
                  <p>(f) A health insurance issuer may not offer for sale individual health insurance coverage in Wyoming unless that coverage is currently offered for sale in the primary state.</p>
                  <p>(g) A person acting, or offering to act, as an agent or broker for a health insurance issuer with respect to the offering of individual health insurance coverage shall obtain a license from Wyoming, with commissions or other compensation subject to the provisions of the laws of Wyoming, except that Wyoming may not impose any qualification or requirement which discriminates against a nonresident agent or broker.</p>
                  <p>(h) Each health insurance issuer issuing individual health insurance coverage in both primary and secondary states shall submit to the insurance commissioner of each state in which it intends to offer the coverage before it may offer individual health insurance coverage in the state:</p>
                  <p>(i) A copy of the plan of operation or feasibility study or any similar statement of the policy being offered and its coverage which shall include the name of its primary state and its principal place of business;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Written notice of any change in its designation of its primary state; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Written notice from the issuer of the issuer's compliance with all the laws of the primary state.</p>
                  <p>(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of any federal or state court to enjoin the solicitation or sale of individual health insurance coverage by a health insurance issuer to any person or group who is not eligible for that insurance.</p>
                  <p>(k) Out-of-state companies offering health benefit plans under this article shall be subject to regulation by the commissioner with regard to enforcement of the contractual benefits under the health benefit plan, including the requirements regarding prompt payment of claims for benefits pursuant to W.S. 26-13-124 and 26-15-124.</p>

                  <p>(a) A policy of group disability or blanket disability insurance shall not be delivered in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions or provisions which in the commissioner's opinion are more favorable to the persons insured or at least as favorable to the persons insured and more favorable to the policyholder:</p>
                  <p>(i) The policy, including endorsements and a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder and the persons insured constitutes the entire contract between the parties;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Written notice of a claim shall be given to the insurer within twenty (20) days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy. Failure to give notice within the time provided by this paragraph shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it is shown it was not reasonably possible to give notice and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The insurer shall furnish either to the person making a claim or to the policyholder for delivery to the person making a claim the forms it usually furnishes for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not furnished before the expiration of fifteen (15) days after giving of the notice specified in paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the person making the claim is deemed to have complied with the requirements of the policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proof of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the extent of the loss for which claim is made;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the case of claim for loss of time for disability, written proof of the loss shall be furnished to the insurer within ninety (90) days after the commencement of the period for which the insurer is liable. Subsequent written proofs of the continuance of the disability shall be furnished to the insurer at any intervals the insurer reasonably requires. In the case of claim for any other loss, written proof of the loss shall be furnished to the insurer within ninety (90) days after the date of the loss. Failure to furnish proof within the time provided by this paragraph shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it is shown it was not reasonably possible to furnish proof and that proof was furnished as soon as was reasonably possible;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any benefits payable under the policy are payable as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Benefits other than benefits for loss of time are payable not more than forty-five (45) days after receipt of written proof of the loss and supporting evidence;</p>
                  <p>(B) Subject to proof of loss and supporting evidence, all accrued benefits payable under a policy for loss of time are payable not less frequently than monthly during the continuance of the disability period for which the insurer is liable, and any balance remaining unpaid at the termination of the disability period is payable immediately upon receipt of proof and supporting evidence.</p>
                  <p>(vi) The insurer, at its own expense, may:</p>
                  <p>(A) Examine the person of the insured when and as often as it reasonably requires during the pendency of claim under the policy; and law.</p>
                  <p>(B) Make an autopsy if it is not prohibited by</p>
                  <p>(vii) No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover under the policy prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days after written proof of loss is furnished in accordance with the requirements of the policy and no action shall be brought upon the expiration of three (3) years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The policyholder is entitled to a grace period of thirty-one (31) days for the payment of any premium due except the first, and during the grace period the policy shall continue in force unless the policyholder gave the insurer written notice of discontinuance in advance of the date of discontinuance and in accordance with the terms of the policy. The policy may provide that the policyholder is liable to the insurer for the payment of a pro rata premium for the time the policy was in force during the grace period provided by this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The validity of the policy shall not be contested except for nonpayment of premiums after it has been in force for two (2) years from the date of issue, and no statement made by any person covered under the policy relating to insurability shall be used in contesting the validity of the insurance with respect to which the statement was made after the insurance has been in force prior to the contest for a period of two (2) years during the person's lifetime unless the statement is contained in a written instrument signed by the person making the statement;</p>
                  <p>(x) A copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder shall be attached to the policy when issued. All statements made by the policyholder or by the persons insured are deemed representations and not warranties. No statement made by any person insured shall be used in any contest unless a copy of the instrument containing the statement is or has been furnished to the person or, in the event of the death or incapacity of the insured person, to the individual's beneficiary or personal representative;</p>
                  <p>(xi) The additional exclusions or limitations, if any, applicable under the policy concerning a disease or physical condition of a person, not otherwise excluded from the person's coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of the person's loss, which existed prior to the effective date of the person's coverage under the policy shall be specified. The exclusion or limitation shall not exclude coverage for a period beyond twelve (12) months following the individual's effective date of coverage and shall only relate to conditions for which medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment was recommended or received during the six (6) months immediately preceding the effective date of coverage. In determining whether a preexisting condition provision applies to an insured or dependent, all private or public health benefit plans shall credit the time the person was previously covered by a private or public health benefit plan if the previous coverage was continuous to a date not more than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of the new coverage exclusive of any applicable waiting period. In the case of a preexisting conditions limitation allowable in the succeeding carrier's plan, the level of benefits applicable to preexisting conditions of persons becoming covered by the succeeding carrier's plan during the period of time this limitation applies under the new plan shall be the lesser of:</p>
                  <p>(A) The benefits of the new plan determined without application of the preexisting conditions limitation; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The benefits of the prior plan.</p>
                  <p>(xii) If the premiums or benefits vary by age, a provision shall specify an equitable adjustment of premiums, benefits, or both, to be made if the age of a covered person has been misstated and containing a clear statement of the method of adjustment to be used;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) The insurer shall issue to the policyholder for delivery to each person insured a certificate containing a statement of the insurance protection to which that person is entitled, to whom the insurance benefits are payable and of any family member's or dependent's coverage;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) Benefits for loss of life of the person insured are payable to the beneficiary designated by the person insured or if the policy contains conditions pertaining to family status the beneficiary may be the family member specified by the policy terms. Payment of benefits for loss of life of the person insured is subject to the provisions of the policy in the event no designated or specified beneficiary is living at the death of the person insured. All other benefits of the policy are payable to the person insured. The policy may provide that if any benefit is payable to the estate of a person or to a person who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay the benefit, up to an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), to any relative by blood, marriage or adoption of the person deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled to the benefits;</p>
                  <p>(xv) For a policy insuring debtors, the insurer shall furnish the policyholder for delivery to each debtor insured under the policy a certificate of insurance describing the coverage and specifying that the benefits payable shall first be applied to reduce or extinguish the indebtedness;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) Repealed By Laws 1997, ch. 120, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(xvii) If issued or delivered on or after January 1, 1999, the policy shall provide a notice on the face of the policy of not less than fourteen (14) point bold type, as to the extent to which the policy includes comprehensive adult wellness benefits as defined in subsection (h) of this section. To insure that the disclosure has been made, the notice shall include space for the signature of the policyholder and the sales representative on the disclosure statement. The disclosure statement must be signed by the applicant and sales representative at the time of the policy application. No policy shall be represented as containing comprehensive adult wellness benefits unless the policy meets the criteria specified under subsection (h) of this section. If coverage is included, the notice shall make reference to the exact location within the policy where the level and extent of coverage is described in detail. If coverage is not included, the notice shall state that the policy does not contain comprehensive adult wellness benefits as defined by law. This statement shall also be placed in a prominent location on any materials used in representing the policy, including sales materials. The department of insurance shall prescribe the form and content of the notice required under this paragraph. This paragraph does not apply to any policy with a deductible of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more.</p>
                  <p>(b) W.S. 26-19-107(a)(xi), (xiii) and (xiv) shall not apply to policies insuring debtors.</p>
                  <p>(c) The standard provisions for individual disability insurance policies shall not apply to group disability insurance policies.</p>
                  <p>(d) If any provision of this section is entirely or partially inapplicable to or inconsistent with the coverage provided by a particular form of policy, the insurer with the approval of the commissioner shall omit from the policy any inapplicable provision or part of a provision and shall modify any inconsistent provision or part of the provision to conform the policy provision with the coverage provided by the policy.</p>

                  <p>(g) A policy of group or blanket disability insurance shall not establish rules for eligibility, including continued eligibility, of any individual to enroll under the policy based on any of the following health status related factors in relation to the employee or an eligible dependent:</p>
                  <p>(i) Health status;</p>

The policy may not require that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person. Any payment made under the policy discharges the insurer's obligation with respect to the amount of insurance so paid.</p>

                  <p>(a) A non-COBRA group policy or certificate of insurance on a master policy of a group delivered or issued for delivery in this state on or after July 1, 1995, issued by any insurance company, nonprofit health service corporation, health maintenance organization or any other insurer that provides hospital, surgical or major medical expense insurance or any accommodation of these coverages on an expense incurred basis, but not a policy that provides benefits for specific diseases or for accidental injuries only, shall provide that employees, members or their covered eligible dependents whose insurance under the group policy would otherwise terminate because of termination of employment or membership or eligibility for coverage are entitled to continue their hospital, surgical and major medical insurance under that group policy, for themselves, their eligible dependents or both, subject to all of the group policy's terms and conditions applicable to those forms of insurance and to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Continuation is only available to an employee or member who has been continuously insured under the group policy and for similar benefits under any group policy which it replaced, during the entire three (3) month period ending with the termination of eligibility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Continuation is not available for any person who is:</p>
                  <p>(A) Covered by medicare, excluding his spouse or dependent children who shall be entitled to continuation; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Covered by any other insured or uninsured arrangement which provides hospital, surgical or medical coverage for individuals in a group.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Continuation need not include dental or vision care benefits or any other benefits provided under the group policy in addition to its hospital, surgical or major medical benefits unless the insurer previously included such benefits and the insured requests such benefits;</p>
                  <p>(iv) An employee or member who wishes continuation of coverage shall request the continuation in writing within the thirty-one (31) day period following the date of termination of coverage;</p>
                  <p>(v) An employee or member electing continuation shall pay to the insurer, third party administrator, group policyholder or the employer, as designated by the employer, on a monthly basis in advance, the amount of contribution required by the policyholder or employer, but not more than one hundred two percent (102%) of the group rate for the insurance being continued under the group policy on the due date of each payment. The employer's designation with regard to whom the electing employee or member shall pay his contribution shall be made in writing prior to the date the first contribution by the employee or member is due. The employee's or member's written election of continuation, together with the first contribution required to establish contributions on a monthly basis in advance, shall be given to the insurer, third party administrator, policyholder or employer within thirty-one (31) days of the date the employee's or member's insurance would otherwise terminate;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Continuation of insurance under the group policy for any person terminates when the person fails to satisfy paragraph (ii) of this subsection or, if earlier, at the first to occur of the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The date twelve (12) months after the date the employee's or member's insurance under the policy would otherwise have terminated because of termination of employment or membership;</p>
                  <p>(B) If the employee or member fails to make timely payment of a required contribution, the end of the period for which contributions were made;</p>
                  <p>(C) The date on which the group policy is terminated or, in the case of an employee, the date the employer terminates participation under the group policy. However, if this subparagraph applies and the coverage ceasing by reason of the termination is replaced by similar coverage under another group policy, the following apply:</p>
                  <p>(I) The employee or member may become covered under that other group policy for the balance of the period that the employee or member would have remained covered under the prior group policy in accordance with this paragraph had a termination described in this subparagraph not occurred;</p>
                  <p>(II) The minimum level of benefits to be provided by the other group policy is the applicable level of benefits of the prior group policy reduced by any benefits payable under that prior group policy;</p>
                  <p>(III) The prior group policy shall continue to provide benefits to the extent of its accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits as if the replacement had not occurred.</p>
                  <p>(vii) A notification of the continuation privilege shall be included in each certificate of coverage;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Upon termination of the continuation period, the member, surviving spouse or dependent is entitled to exercise any option which is provided in the group plan to elect a conversion policy. The member electing a conversion policy shall notify the carrier of the election and pay the required premium within thirty-one (31) days of the termination of the continued coverage under the group contract.</p>
                  <p>(b) As used in subsection (a) of this section, "non-COBRA" means any group policy or certificate of insurance on a master policy of a group policy which is not subject to continuation of rights as provided under the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-19-203. Continuance of coverage where one carrier's contract replaces a plan of similar benefits of another carrier.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) In those instances in which one (1) carrier's contract replaces a plan of similar benefits of another carrier:</p>
                  <p>(i) The prior carrier remains liable only to the extent of its accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits. The position of the prior carrier shall be the same whether the group policy holder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures or foregoes the provision of coverage;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The succeeding carrier is liable under the following circumstances:</p>
                  <p>(A) Each person covered under the prior carrier's plan shall be eligible for complete coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits, which shall include coverage for ninety (90) days for any complication caused as a result of a condition for which benefits were paid under the prior plan within ninety (90) days prior to termination of that plan. Copayment and deductible levels for coverage required under this subparagraph may be applied in a manner consistent with those provided by the succeeding carrier's plan;</p>
                  <p>(B) In the case of a preexisting conditions limitation included in the succeeding carrier's plan, the level of benefits applicable to preexisting conditions of persons becoming covered by the succeeding carrier's plan in accordance with this paragraph during the period of time this limitation applies under the new plan shall be the lesser of:</p>
                  <p>(I) The benefits of the new plan determined without application of the preexisting conditions limitations; or</p>
                  <p>(II) The benefits of the prior plan.</p>
                  <p>(C) In any situation where a determination of the prior carrier's benefit is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the prior carrier shall furnish a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information, sufficient to permit verification of the benefit determination or the determination itself by the succeeding carrier. For the purposes of this section, benefits of the prior plan will be determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination will be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier.</p>

                  <p>(a) This act shall apply to any health benefit plan which provides coverage to two (2) or more employees of a small employer in this state if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any portion of the premium or benefits is paid by a small employer or if an eligible employee or dependent is reimbursed, whether through wage adjustments or otherwise, by a small employer for any portion of the premium; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The health benefit plan is treated by the employer or any of the eligible employees or dependents as part of a plan or program for the purposes of section 162, section 125 or section 106 existing as of the effective date of this act or similar sections subsequently enacted of the United States Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, W.S. 26-19-305(a) and (c) and 26-19-304(a) shall not apply to individual health benefit policies sold to small employers which are subject to approval for policy form by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(c) A Taft-Hartley trust, or a carrier with the written authorization of a Taft-Hartley trust may make a written request to the commissioner for a waiver from the application of any of the provisions of W.S. 26-19-304(a) with respect to a health benefit plan provided to the trust. The commissioner may grant the waiver if he finds that application of W.S. 26-19-304(a) with respect to the trust would have a substantial adverse effect on the participants and beneficiaries of the trust, and would require significant modifications to one (1) or more collectively bargained arrangement for which the trust is established or maintained. A waiver granted under this subsection shall not apply to an individual if the person participates in the trust as an associate member of an employee organization.</p>
                  <p>(d) This act shall apply to multiple employer welfare arrangements, consistent with W.S. 26-19-115.</p>

                  <p>(i) The index rate for a rating period for any class of business shall not exceed the index rate for any other class of business by more than twenty percent (20%);</p>
                  <p>(ii) For a class of business, the premium rates charged during a rating period to small employers with similar case characteristics for the same or similar coverage, or the rates which could be charged to employers under the rating system for that class of business shall not vary from the index rate by more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the index rate;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The percentage increase in the premium rate charged to a small employer for a new rating period shall not exceed the sum of the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The percentage change in the new business premium rate measured from the first day of the prior rating period to the first day of the new rating period. In the case of a health benefit plan into which a small employer carrier is no longer enrolling new small employers, the carrier shall use the percentage change in the base premium rate, provided that the change does not exceed, on a percentage basis, the change in the new business premium rate for the most similar health benefit plan into which the carrier is actively enrolling new small employers;</p>
                  <p>(B) Any adjustment, not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) annually and adjusted pro rata for rating periods of less than one (1) year, due to the claim experience, health status or duration of coverage of the employees or dependents of the small employer as determined from the small employer carrier's rate manual for the class of business; and</p>

                  <p>(v) Any adjustment in rates charged by a small employer carrier caused by reinsurance is subject to the rating limitations set forth in this section;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Premium rates for health benefit plans shall comply with the requirements of this section notwithstanding any assessments paid or payable by small employer carriers under this act;</p>
                  <p>(vii) In any case where a small employer carrier utilizes industry as a case characteristic in establishing premium rates, the rate factor associated with any industry classification shall not vary from the arithmetic average of the rate factors associated with all industry classifications by greater than fifteen percent (15%) of such coverage;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In the case of health benefit plans issued prior to the effective date of this act, a premium rate for a rating period may exceed the ranges set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of subsection (a) of this section for a period of three (3) years following the effective date of this act. In such case, the percentage increase in the premium rate charged to a small employer in such a class of business for a new rating period may not exceed the sum of the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The percentage change in the new business premium rate measured from the first day of the prior rating period to the first day of the new rating period. In the case of a health benefit plan into which a small employer carrier is no longer enrolling new small employers, the carrier shall use the percentage change in the base premium rate, provided that the change does not exceed, on a percentage basis, the change in the new business premium rate for the most similar health benefit plan into which the carrier is actively enrolling new small employers; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Any adjustment due to change in coverage or change in the case characteristics of the small employer as determined from the carrier's rate manual for the class of business.</p>
                  <p>(ix) Small employer carriers shall apply rating factors, including case characteristics, consistently with respect to all small employers in a class of business;</p>
                  <p>(x) For the purposes of this subsection, a health benefit plan that utilizes a provider network shall not be considered similar coverage to a health benefit plan that does not utilize such a network, provided that utilization of the network results in substantial differences in claims costs;</p>
                  <p>(xi) The small employer carrier shall not use case characteristics, other than age, gender, industry, geographic area, family composition and group size without prior approval of the commissioner;</p>
                  <p>(xii) The commissioner shall adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this section and to assure that rating practices used by small employer carriers are consistent with the purposes of this act, including regulations that:</p>
                  <p>(A) Assure that differences in rates charged for health benefit plans by small employer carriers are reasonable and reflect objective differences in plan design;</p>

A small employer carrier shall not offer to transfer a small employer into or out of a class of business unless the offer is made to transfer all small employers in the class of business without regard to case characteristics, claim experience, health status or duration of coverage since issue.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner may suspend for a specified period the application of paragraph (a)(i) of this section as to the premium rates applicable to one (1) or more small employers included within a class of business of a small employer carrier for one (1) or more rating periods upon a filing by the small employer carrier and a finding by the commissioner either that the suspension is reasonable in light of financial condition of the small employer carrier or that the suspension would enhance the efficiency and fairness of the marketplace for small employer health insurance.</p>
                  <p>(d) In connection with the offering for sale of any health benefit plan to a small employer, the small employer carrier shall make a reasonable disclosure, as part of its solicitation and sales materials, of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The extent to which premium rates for a specified small employer are established or adjusted in part based upon the actual or expected variation in claims costs or actual or expected variation in health condition of the employees and dependents of the small employer;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The provisions concerning the small employer carrier's right to change premium rates and the factors other than claim experience which affect changes in premium rates;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The provisions relating to renewability of policies and contracts; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The provisions relating to any preexisting condition provision.</p>
                  <p>(e) Each small employer carrier shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Maintain at its principal place of business a complete and detailed description of its rating practices and renewal underwriting practices, including information and documentation that demonstrate that its rating methods and practices are based upon commonly accepted actuarial assumptions and are in accordance with sound actuarial principles;</p>
                  <p>(ii) File with the commissioner annually on or before March 15 an actuarial certification certifying that the carrier is in compliance with this act and that the rating methods of the small employer carrier are actuarially sound. A copy of the certification shall be retained by the small employer carrier at its principal place of business;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Make the information and documentation described in paragraph (i) of this subsection available to the commissioner upon request. Except in cases of violations of this act, the information shall be considered proprietary and trade secret information and shall not be subject to disclosure by the commissioner to persons outside of the department except as agreed to by the small employer carrier or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                  <p>(a) A health benefit plan subject to this act shall be renewable with respect to all eligible employees or dependents at the option of the employer except in the following cases:</p>
                  <p>(i) Nonpayment of the required premiums;</p>

                  <p>(vii) The commissioner finds that the continuation of the coverage would:</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-19-306. Availability of coverage.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the commissioner's approval of the basic health benefit plan and the standard health benefit plan developed pursuant to W.S. 26-19-308, but in no case prior to March 31, 1993, every small employer carrier shall, as a condition of transacting business in this state with small employers, actively offer to small employers all health benefit plans which it actively markets to small employers in this state, including at least two (2) health benefit plans. One (1) plan to be offered by each small employer carrier shall be a basic health benefit plan and one (1) plan shall be a standard health benefit plan. Except as provided in this section, all small employer carriers shall issue any health benefit plan to any eligible small employer that applies for the plan and agrees to make the required premium payments and to satisfy the other reasonable provisions of the plan. Carriers or multiple employer welfare associations whose bylaws or charters do not permit them to issue coverage on a marketwide basis shall only be required to guarantee issue to those small employers which meet the requirements of the bylaws or charters. Charter or bylaw provisions which prohibit issuance to specific populations based on health status or health risk shall not be considered as exceptions to the requirements of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) A small employer carrier shall file with the commissioner, in a format and manner prescribed by the commissioner, the basic health benefit plan and the standard health benefit plan to be used by the carrier. A plan filed pursuant to this section may be used by a small employer carrier beginning forty-five (45) days after it is filed unless the commissioner disapproves its use. The commissioner at any time may, after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the small employer carrier, disapprove the continued use by a small employer carrier of a basic or standard health benefit plan on the grounds that the plan does not meet the requirements of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) All health benefit plans covering small employers shall comply with the following provisions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Preexisting condition provisions shall not exclude coverage for a period beyond twelve (12) months following the individual's effective date of coverage and shall only relate to conditions for which medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment was recommended or received during the six (6) months immediately preceding the effective date of coverage. Pregnancy shall not be treated as a preexisting condition. Genetic information shall not be treated as a preexisting condition in the absence of a diagnosis of a condition related to such information;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In determining whether a preexisting condition provision applies to an eligible employee or dependent, all health benefit plans shall credit the time the person was previously covered by public or private health insurance or other health benefit arrangement if the previous coverage was continuous to a date not more than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of the new coverage, exclusive of any applicable waiting period under such plan;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Late enrollees may be excluded from coverage for the greater of eighteen (18) months or an eighteen (18) month preexisting condition exclusion, provided that if both a period of exclusion from coverage and a preexisting condition exclusion are applicable to a late enrollee, the combined period shall not exceed eighteen (18) months;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any requirement used by a small employer carrier in determining whether to provide coverage to a small employer group, including requirements for minimum participation of eligible employees and minimum employer contributions, shall be applied uniformly among all small employer groups with the same number of eligible employees applying for coverage or receiving coverage from the small employer carrier. A small employer carrier may vary application of minimum participation requirements and minimum employer contribution requirements only by the size of the small employer group;</p>
                  <p>(v) In applying minimum participation requirements with respect to a small employer, a small employer carrier shall not consider employees or dependents who are otherwise covered by a public or an employment based health benefit plan in determining whether the applicable percentage of participation is met;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If a small employer carrier offers coverage to a small employer, it shall offer coverage to all of the small employer's eligible employees and may offer coverage to their dependents. A small employer carrier shall not offer coverage to only certain persons in a group or to only part of a group, except in the case of late enrollees as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection. Except as permitted under paragraphs (i) and (iii) of this subsection, a small employer carrier shall not modify a health benefit plan with respect to a small employer or any eligible employee or dependent, through riders, endorsements or otherwise, to restrict or exclude coverage or benefits for specified diseases, medical conditions or services otherwise covered by the plan;</p>
                  <p>(vii) In the case of a group health plan that offers medical care through health insurance coverage offered by a health maintenance organization, the plan may provide for an affiliation period with respect to coverage through the health maintenance organization only if:</p>
                  <p>(A) No preexisting condition exclusion is imposed with respect to such coverage;</p>
                  <p>(B) The affiliation period is applied uniformly without regard to any health status related factors; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The affiliation period does not exceed two (2) months, or three (3) months in the case of a late enrollee.</p>
                  <p>(d) No small employer carrier shall be required to offer coverage or accept applications pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in the case of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) To a small employer, where the small employer is not physically located in the small employer carrier's established geographic service area;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To an employer whose employees do not work or reside within the small employer carrier's established geographic service area; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Within an area where the small employer carrier reasonably anticipates, and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that it will not have the capacity within its established geographic service area to deliver service adequately to the members of such groups because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees.</p>
                  <p>(e) A small employer carrier that cannot offer coverage pursuant to paragraph (d)(iii) of this section shall not offer coverage in the applicable area to new cases of employer groups with more than fifty (50) eligible employees or small employer groups until the later of one hundred eighty (180) days following each such refusal or the date on which the carrier notifies the commissioner that it has regained capacity to deliver services to small employer groups.</p>
                  <p>(f) If any carrier has insured a disproportionate number of small employer groups with employees requiring reinsurance, the carrier may petition the commissioner to temporarily suspend the requirement to accept every small employer applying for coverage. The suspension may be granted only if the commissioner finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) The carrier is reasonably reinsuring lives at a rate of at least one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the statewide average for reinsurance; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The rate of reinsurance is having a significant disproportional adverse effect on the carrier that is impairing its ability to offer policies at competitive rates in the small group market.</p>
                  <p>(g) A small employer carrier shall not be required to offer coverage or accept applications pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for so long as the commissioner finds that the acceptance of an application or applications would place the small employer carrier in a financially impaired condition.</p>
                  <p>(h) The requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply to any carrier which maintains existing health benefit plans covering eligible employees of one (1) or more small employers but is no longer enrolling new small employers.</p>
                  <p>(j) In addition to the prohibition on the use of genetic testing information provided in paragraph (c)(i) of this section, all health benefit plans covering small employers shall not, based on the genetic testing information of an individual or a family member of an individual:</p>
                  <p>(i) Establish rules of eligibility to enroll in the plan;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Deny eligibility;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Adjust premium rates;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Adjust contribution rates;</p>
                  <p>(v) Request or require predictive genetic testing information concerning an individual or a family member of the individual, except the health benefit plan may only request, but not require, predictive genetic testing information if needed for diagnosis, treatment or payment. As part of a request under this paragraph, the plan or issuer shall provide a description of the procedures in place to safeguard confidentiality of the information.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is hereby created a nonprofit entity to be known as the "Wyoming small employer health reinsurance program" or "WySEHRP."</p>
                  <p>(b) Within sixty (60) days of a written request by the commissioner, each small employer carrier shall make a filing with the commissioner containing the carrier's net health insurance premium derived from health benefit plans delivered to small employers in this state in the previous calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(c) Participating carriers shall nominate board members which shall be subject to approval by the commissioner. The board shall consist of at least three (3) and not more than seven (7) representatives who shall serve three (3) year staggered terms. To the extent possible, the board shall include representation from carriers whose principal health insurance business is in the small employer market, health maintenance organizations and nonprofit health, hospital or medical service corporations. Members of the board shall be reimbursed from the assets of the program for expenses incurred by them as members of the board but shall not otherwise be compensated by the program for their services. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall be an ex officio voting member of the board.

                  <p>(e) Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the selection or appointment of an initial board pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the board shall submit to the commissioner a plan of operation and thereafter any amendments necessary or suitable, to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the program. The plan of operation shall be effective upon approval in writing by the commissioner consistent with the date on which the coverage under this section is available. Any plan of operation or amendments thereto, submitted to the commissioner by the board pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed approved by the commissioner if not expressly disapproved in writing by the commissioner within ninety (90) days of its receipt by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed by Laws 2017, ch. 58, § 2.</p>

The program shall also have the specific authority to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Enter into contracts necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this act, including the authority, with the approval of the commissioner, to enter into contracts with similar programs of other states for the joint performance of common functions or with persons or other organizations for the performance of administrative functions;</p>

The board annually shall adjust the deductible reinsurance requirement to reflect increases in costs and utilization within the standard market for health benefit plans within the state. The adjustment shall not be less than the annual change in the medical component of the "Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers" of the department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, unless the board proposes and the commissioner approves a lower adjustment factor. Also, with the approval of the commissioner the board may increase or decrease the amount set forth in paragraph (j)(v) of this section and paragraphs (k)(i) and (ii) of this section if it is necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act and does not require participating carriers to retain an unreasonable level of risk.</p>

                  <p>(i) With respect to a basic health benefit plan or a standard health benefit plan, the program shall reinsure the level of coverage provided and, with respect to other plans, the program shall reinsure up to the level of coverage provided in a basic or standard health benefit plan;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except in the case of a late enrollee, a participating carrier may reinsure an eligible employee or dependent within sixty (60) days of the commencement of the coverage of the small employer. A newly eligible employee or dependent may be reinsured within sixty (60) days of the commencement of his coverage;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A participating carrier may reinsure an entire employer group within sixty (60) days of the commencement of the group's coverage under the plan. The carrier may choose to reinsure newly eligible employees and dependents of a reinsured group pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any eligible small employer group business in force before a program's plan of operation becomes effective shall be reinsured by the program only if the board determines that sufficient funding sources are available. The board shall adopt rules and regulations providing conditions under which reinsurance will be issued on employers, employees, or dependents who were subject to riders, endorsements or other contract provisions which restricted or excluded coverage or benefits for specified diseases, medical conditions or services otherwise covered by the plans if the provisions were in force prior to the effective date of the program's plan of operation. The reinsurance may be limited to coverage for the specified diseases, medical conditions or services that had previously been restricted or excluded by the riders, endorsements or other provisions;</p>
                  <p>(v) The program shall not reimburse a participating carrier with respect to the claims of a reinsured employee or dependent until the carrier has paid a deductible of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in a calendar year for benefits covered by the program. A participating carrier's liability under this paragraph shall not exceed a maximum limit of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), in any one (1) calendar year with respect to any one (1) person reinsured. The amounts stated in this paragraph shall be increased in accordance with inflation adjustments made by the board under paragraph (h)(x) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A participating carrier may terminate reinsurance for all of the reinsured employees or dependents of a small employer on any plan anniversary;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Premium rates charged for reinsurance by the program to a health maintenance organization which is federally qualified under 42 U.S.C. § 300 e(c)(2)(A) or a similar section subsequently enacted, and as such is subject to requirements that limit the amount of risk that may be ceded to the program that is more restrictive than paragraph (v) of this subsection, shall be reduced to reflect that portion of the risk above the amount set forth in paragraph (v) of this subsection that shall not be ceded to the program, if any;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The board may consider adjustments to the premium rates charged for reinsurance by the program for carriers using effective cost containment, including high-cost case management, as defined by the board;</p>
                  <p>(ix) A participating carrier shall apply its case management and claims handling techniques, including but not limited to utilization review, individual case management, preferred provider provisions, other managed care provisions or methods of operation, consistently with both reinsured and nonreinsured business.</p>
                  <p>(k) The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall establish a methodology for determining premium rates to be charged by the program for reinsuring small employers and individuals pursuant to this section. The methodology shall include a system for classification of small employers that reflects the types of case characteristics commonly used by small employer carriers in the state. The methodology shall provide for the development of base reinsurance premium rates, which shall be multiplied by the factors set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection to determine the premium rates for the program. The base reinsurance premium rates and number and type of insured groupings shall be established by the board, subject to the approval of the commissioner, and shall be set at levels which reasonably approximate gross premiums charged to small employers by small employer carriers. The board periodically shall review the methodology established under this subsection, including the system of classification and any rating factors, to assure that it reasonably reflects the claims experience of the program. The board may propose changes to the methodology which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner. The board shall take steps to expand the usage of the reinsurance program and to reduce the impacts of high risk individuals on any particular group. Premiums for the program shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) An entire small employer group may be reinsured for a rate that is between one and one-tenth (1.1) and one and one-half (1.5) times the base reinsurance premium rate for the group established pursuant to this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An eligible employee or dependent may be reinsured for a rate that is between one and one-half (1.5) and five (5) times the base reinsurance premium rate for the individual established pursuant to this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The premiums shall be kept as close as practical to the lower limits provided by this subsection except to the extent needed to keep the assessments needed within the forty percent (40%) of premium tax limit pursuant to W.S. 26-19-312(b).</p>
                  <p>(m) In any case where a health benefit plan for a small employer is entirely or partially reinsured with the program, the premium charged to the small employer for any rating period for the coverage issued shall be consistent with the requirements relating to premium rates set forth in W.S. 26-19-304(a).</p>
                  <p>(n) Assessments and other fees required by the program shall be made in accordance with this subsection:</p>

                  <p>(a) After each calendar year, the board shall determine the amount of assessment needed to support the small carrier reinsurance program considering all payments made, costs incurred, premiums received and other income received.</p>
                  <p>(b) All authorized insurers liable for premium tax shall be assessed as necessary to meet the requirements determined under subsection (a) of this section. The assessment shall be in proportion to the gross premium tax owed and shall be expressed as a percentage of the gross premium tax owed. The gross premium tax is the premium tax owed before any deduction for any assessments. The assessment pursuant to this subsection for any individual insurer shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the gross premium tax owed.</p>
                  <p>(c) On or before June 1 of each year, the board shall determine each insurer's assessment for the calendar year. Any deficit incurred by the program shall be recouped by assessment apportioned as provided by this section. Notification of assessments shall be mailed by the board not later than June 1 of each year.</p>
                  <p>(d) The total amount of assessment paid by any insurer pursuant to this section plus an amount equal to five percent (5%) of that total assessment shall be allowed as a credit against any premium or retaliatory tax owed by the member under this code for the year for which the assessment is payable. If assessments including the additional credit authorized exceed the premium or retaliatory tax owed considering all assessments pursuant to this act and other acts, the credits may be carried forward to other tax years until used.</p>
                  <p>(e) If assessments exceed actual losses and administrative expenses of the program, the excess shall be paid to the state treasurer, credited to the account created by W.S. 26-19-311 and used by the administrator to offset future losses or to reduce program premiums. As used in this subsection, "future losses" includes reserves for incurred but unreported claims.</p>
                  <p>(f) The board may require initial calendar year 2006 and interim assessments as reasonably necessary for the organizational, administrative and interim operating expenses of the program and to pay claims in excess of premiums collected. Any initial or interim assessments shall be credited as offsets against any regular assessment due following the close of the calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(g) Assessments collected pursuant to the small employer carrier reinsurance program shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited to the account created by W.S. 26-19-311.</p>

The commissioner shall specify in the notice the reason for his disapproval and state that a hearing will be granted within twenty (20) days after request in writing by the insurer. No policy, certificate of insurance, notice of proposed insurance, application, endorsement or rider shall be issued or used until the expiration of thirty (30) days after it is filed, unless the commissioner gives his prior written approval thereto.</p>
                <p>(d) The commissioner, at any time after a hearing held not less than twenty (20) days after written notice to the insurer, may withdraw his approval of any form on any ground set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The written notice of hearing shall state the reason for the proposed withdrawal.</p>
                <p>(e) The insurer shall not issue or use any form after the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
                <p>(f) If a group policy of credit life insurance or credit disability insurance is delivered in another state, the insurer shall file only the group certificate and notice of proposed insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this state as specified in W.S. 26-21-107(b) and (d). The commissioner shall approve the forms if they conform with the requirements specified in W.S. 26-21-107(b) and (d) and if the schedules of premium rates applicable to the insurance evidenced by the certificate or notice are not in excess of the insurer's schedules of premium rates filed with the commissioner.</p>

                  <p>(a) Issuance of a converted policy is subject to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Written application for the converted policy shall be made and the first premium paid to the insurer not later than thirty-one (31) days after termination of the insured's coverage by the group policy and termination of the subsequent continuation rights offered by the group policy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The effective date of the converted policy is the day following the termination of the insured's coverage under the group policy and termination of the subsequent continuation rights offered by the group policy;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The converted policy shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) Cover the employee or member and his dependents who were covered by the group policy on the date of termination of insurance, and at the insurer's option, a separate converted policy may be issued to cover any dependent;</p>
                  <p>(B) Be issued without evidence of insurability;</p>
                  <p>(C) Not exclude a preexisting condition not excluded by the group policy.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The insurer is not required to issue a converted policy:</p>
                  <p>(A) Covering any person if the person is or could be covered by Medicare (Title XVIII of the United States Social Security Act as added by the Social Security Amendments of 1965 or as later amended or superseded);</p>
                  <p>(B) Covering any person if:</p>
                  <p>(I) The person is covered for similar benefits by another hospital, surgical, medical or major medical expense insurance policy or hospital or medical service subscriber contract or medical practice or other prepayment plan or by any other plan or program; or</p>
                  <p>(II) The person is eligible for similar benefits, whether or not covered therefor, under any arrangement of coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis; or</p>
                  <p>(III) Similar benefits are provided for or available to the person, pursuant to or in accordance with the requirements of any state or federal law; and</p>
                  <p>(IV) The benefits provided under the sources referred to in subdivision (B)(I) of this paragraph for the person or benefits provided or available under the sources referred to in subdivisions (B)(II) and (III) of this paragraph for the person, together with the benefits provided by the converted policy, would result in overinsurance according to the insurer's standards. The insurer's standards must bear some reasonable relationship to actual health care costs in the area in which the insured lives at the time of conversion and must be filed with the commissioner prior to their use in denying coverage;</p>
                  <p>(V) Which provides benefits in excess of those provided under the group policy from which conversion is made.</p>
                  <p>(v) A converted policy may:</p>
                  <p>(A) Include a provision whereby the insurer may request information in advance of any premium due date of the policy of any person covered thereunder as to whether:</p>
                  <p>(I) He is covered for similar benefits by another hospital, surgical, medical or major medical expense insurance policy or hospital or medical service subscriber contract or medical practice or other prepayment plan or by any other plan or program;</p>
                  <p>(II) He is covered for similar benefits under any arrangement of coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis; or</p>
                  <p>(III) Similar benefits are provided for or available to the person, pursuant to or in accordance with the requirements of any state or federal law.</p>
                  <p>(B) Provide that the insurer may refuse to renew the policy or the coverage of any person insured thereunder for the following reasons only:</p>
                  <p>(I) Either the benefits provided under the sources referred to in subdivisions (A)(I) and (II) of this paragraph for the person or benefits provided or available under the sources referred to in subdivision (A)(III) of this paragraph for the person, together with the benefits provided by the converted policy, would result in overinsurance according to the insurer's standards on file with the commissioner, or the converted policyholder fails to provide the requested information;</p>
                  <p>(II) Fraud or material misrepresentation in applying for any benefits under the converted policy;</p>
                  <p>(III) Eligibility of the insured person for coverage under Medicare (Title XVIII of the United States Social Security Act as added by the Social Security Amendments of 1965 or as later amended or superseded) or under any other state or federal law providing for benefits similar to those provided by the converted policy;</p>
                  <p>(IV) Other reasons the commissioner approves.</p>
                  <p>(C) Provide that any hospital, surgical or medical benefits payable thereunder may be reduced by the amount of any such benefits payable under the group policy after the termination of the individual's insurance under the group policy;</p>
                  <p>(D) Provide that during the first policy year the benefits payable under the converted policy, together with the benefits payable under the group policy, shall not exceed those that would have been payable had the individual's insurance under the group policy remained in force and effect;</p>
                  <p>(E) Provide for reduction of coverage on any person upon his eligibility for coverage under Medicare (Title XVIII of the United States Social Security Act as added by the Social Security Amendments of 1965 or as later amended or superseded) or under any other state or federal law providing for benefits similar to those provided by the converted policy.</p>
                  <p>(vi) Subject to the provisions and conditions of this section:</p>
                  <p>(A) If the group insurance policy from which conversion is made insures the employee or member for:</p>
                  <p>(I) Basic hospital or surgical expense insurance, the employee or member is entitled to obtain a converted policy providing, at his option, coverage on an expense incurred basis under any one (1) of the plans meeting the following requirements:</p>
                  <p>(1) Plan A:</p>
                  <p>a. Hospital room and board daily expense benefits in a maximum dollar amount approximating the average semiprivate rate charged in metropolitan areas of this state, for a maximum duration of seventy (70) days;</p>

                  <p>a. Hospital room and board daily expense benefits in a maximum dollar amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum dollar amount determined for Plan A, for a maximum duration of seventy (70) days;</p>
                  <p>b. Miscellaneous hospital expense benefits of a maximum amount of ten (10) times the hospital room and board daily expense benefits; and c.

                  <p>(xiv) If the benefit levels required in paragraph</p>
                  <p>(vi) of this subsection exceed the benefit levels provided under the group policy, the conversion policy may offer benefits which are substantially similar to those provided under the group policy instead of those required in paragraph (vi) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(xv) Maternity benefits may be included at the insured's option and may be subject to the preexisting conditions limitations as discussed under paragraph (v) of this subsection;</p>

                  <p>(a) No title insurance policy as to property in this state shall be written unless it is based upon adequate evidence of the current condition of title certified in writing as of the date of the policy by a person duly authorized under W.S. 33-2-101 to act as a title abstractor in the county where the property is situated, or based upon the opinion of an attorney authorized to practice law in this state as to the condition of the title following a review by the attorney of pertinent title records or abstracts. Evidence of the examination of title and determination of insurability shall be preserved and retained in the files of the title insurer or its title agent for a period of not less than fifteen (15) years after the title insurance policy has been issued. Instead of retaining the original evidence, the title insurer or title agent, in the regular course of business, may establish a system whereby all or part of the evidence is recorded, copied or reproduced by any process that accurately and legibly reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the contents of the original. This subsection does not apply to a title insurer:</p>
                  <p>(i) Assuming liability through a contract of reinsurance; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Acting as coinsurer if one (1) of the other coinsuring title insurers has complied with this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as allowed by regulations the commissioner promulgates, no title insurer or title agent shall knowingly issue any title insurance policy or commitment to insure without showing all outstanding, enforceable, recorded liens or other interests against the property, title to which is to be insured.</p>

                  <p>(a) A domestic title insurer shall establish and maintain a reinsurance reserve computed in accordance with this section, and all sums attributed to that reserve are considered and constitute unearned portions of the original premiums. This reserve shall be reported as a liability of the title insurer in its financial statements.</p>
                  <p>(b) The reinsurance reserve shall be maintained by the title insurer for the protection of holders of title insurance policies. Except as provided in this section, assets equal in value to the reinsurance reserve are not subject to distribution among creditors or stockholders of the title insurer until all claims of policyholders or claims under reinsurance contracts have been paid in full, and all liability on the policies or reinsurance contracts has been paid in full and discharged or lawfully reinsured.</p>
                  <p>(c) A foreign or alien title insurance company licensed to transact title insurance business in this state shall maintain at least the same reserves on title insurance policies issued on properties located in this state as are required of domestic title insurance companies, unless the laws of the jurisdiction of domicile of the foreign or alien title insurance company require a higher amount.</p>
                  <p>(d) The reinsurance reserve shall consist of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount of the reinsurance reserve on May 27, 1983; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) A sum equal to twenty cents ($.20) for each one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) of net retained liability under each title insurance policy on a single risk written on properties located in this state written after May 27, 1983.</p>
                  <p>(e) Amounts placed in the reinsurance reserve in any year in accordance with paragraph (d)(ii) of this section shall be deducted in determining the net profit of the title insurer for that year.</p>
                  <p>(f) A title insurer shall release from the reinsurance reserve a sum equal to the appropriate amount as set forth in the most recent National Association of Insurance Commissioners' accounting practices and procedures manual. The amount of the reinsurance reserve or similar unearned premium reserve maintained before July 1, 2001, shall be released in accordance with the law in effect at the time such reserves became effective.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a domestic title insurer becomes insolvent, is in the process of liquidation of dissolution or is in the commissioner's possession:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount of the assets of the title insurance company equal to the reinsurance reserve then remaining may be used by or with the commissioner's written approval to pay for reinsurance of the title insurer's liability upon all outstanding title insurance policies or reinsurance agreements to the extent to which claims for losses by the holders thereof are not then pending. The balance of assets, if any, equal to the reinsurance reserve may then be transferred to the title insurer's general assets;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The assets net of the reinsurance reserve shall be available to pay claims for losses sustained by holders of title insurance policies then pending or arising up to the time reinsurance is effected. If claims for losses exceed the title insurer's other assets those claims, when established, shall be paid pro rata out of the surplus assets attributable to the reinsurance reserve, to the extent of the surplus, if any.</p>
                  <p>(b) If reinsurance is not obtained, assets equal to the reinsurance reserve and assets constituting minimum capital, or so much as remains thereof after outstanding claims have been paid, constitute a trust fund to be held and invested by the commissioner for twenty (20) years, out of which claims of policyholders shall be paid as they arise. The balance, if any, of the trust fund, at the expiration of twenty (20) years, shall revert to the general assets of the title insurer.</p>

                  <p>(b) Upon receiving notice from or on behalf of the insured of a title defect in or lien or adverse claim against the title of the insured that may result in a loss or cause expense to be incurred in the proper disposition of the claim, the title insurer shall determine the amount to be added to the reserve, which amount shall reflect a careful estimate of the loss or loss expense likely to result by reason of the claim.</p>

Reinsurance on policies issued on properties located in this state must be obtained from title insurers licensed to transact title insurance business in this state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon application by a title insurer, the commissioner may permit the insurer to obtain reinsurance from a title insurer not licensed in this state if:</p>

                  <p>(a) Premium rates shall not be inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory.</p>
                  <p>(b) Rates are excessive if in the aggregate they are likely to produce a long run profit that is unreasonably high in relation to the riskiness of the class of business, or if expenses are unreasonably high in relation to the services rendered.</p>
                  <p>(c) Rates are inadequate if they are clearly insufficient, together with investment income attributable to them, to sustain projected losses and expenses, or if the continued use of such rates will have the effect of substantially lessening competition or the effect of tending to create a monopoly.</p>
                  <p>(d) Premium rates are unfairly discriminatory if the premium charged for any classification is not reasonably related to the services performed or the risks assumed by the insurer, provided within rate classifications, premiums, to a reasonable degree, may be less in the case of smaller insurances and the excess may be charged against larger insurances without rendering the rate unfairly discriminatory.</p>
                  <p>(e) In making or reviewing rates, consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss experience, to exposure to loss, to underwriting practice and judgment, to past and prospective expenses including amounts paid to or retained by title agents, to investment income, to a reasonable margin for profit and contingencies and to any other relevant factors both within and outside of this state.</p>
                  <p>(f) The commissioner may promulgate rules or regulations setting forth guidelines for evaluation of rates. These regulations may include consideration of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Costs of underwriting risks assumed by the insurer;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Amounts paid to or retained by title agents;</p>

                  <p>(a) A title insurer shall file with the commissioner the premium rate schedules it proposes to use in this state. If the commissioner finds in his review of a filing that it does not violate W.S. 26-23-325, he shall approve the schedule within thirty (30) days of filing. Prior to such approval, the commissioner may conduct public hearings with respect to the filing. Filings that the commissioner fails to approve or disapprove within thirty (30) days of filing are approved. Upon notice to the title insurer, the period for review of rate filing may be extended for an additional thirty (30) days. If within the waiting period or extension thereof the commissioner finds that the filing does violate W.S. 26-23-325, he shall give written notice of disapproval of the filing to the insurer or rating organization which made the filing, specifying therein in what specific respects he finds the filing violates W.S. 26-23-325 and stating that the filing shall not become effective.</p>
                  <p>(b) If at any time after the approval of filing, the commissioner believes that the filing does not meet the requirements of this section or is otherwise contrary to law, or if any party having an interest in the filing makes a written complaint to the commissioner setting forth specific and reasonable grounds for the complaint, or if any insurer, upon notice of disapproval by the commissioner of a filing pursuant to this section, requests, the commissioner shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days and shall give written notice of the hearing to all parties in interest. The commissioner may confirm, modify, change or rescind any previous action, if warranted by the facts shown at the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(c) No title insurer or title agent shall use or collect any premium after May 27, 1983, except in accordance with the premium rate schedule filed with and approved by the commissioner as required by this section. The commissioner may provide by regulation for interim use of premium rate schedules in effect prior to May 27, 1983.</p>

Prior to such approval, the commissioner may conduct public hearings with respect to the filing. Filings that the commissioner has failed to approve or disapprove within thirty (30) days of filing are deemed approved. Upon notice to the title insurer, the period for review of a form filing may be extended for an additional thirty (30) days. If, within the waiting period or extension thereof, the commissioner finds that the filing does violate W.S. 26-23-329, he shall give written notice of disapproval of the filing to the insurer or rating organization which made the filing, specifying therein in what specific respects he finds the filing violates W.S. 26-23-329 and stating that the filing shall not become effective.</p>

                <p>(a) A domestic stock or mutual insurer may borrow money to defray the expenses of its organization, provide it with surplus funds or for any other purpose of its business, upon a written agreement that the money is required to be repaid only out of the insurer's surplus in excess of that stipulated in the agreement. The agreement may provide for interest not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum, which interest shall or shall not constitute a liability of the insurer as to its funds other than the excess of surplus, as stipulated in the agreement. No commission or promotion expense shall be paid in connection with any such loan, except that if public offering and sale is made of the loan securities, the insurer may pay the reasonable costs thereof the commissioner approves.</p>
                <p>(b) Any money borrowed as provided in subsection (a) of this section, together with the interest thereon if stipulated in the agreement, shall not form a part of the insurer's legal liabilities except as to its surplus in excess of the amount stipulated in the agreement, or be the basis of any setoff. Until the money is repaid financial statements filed or published by the insurer shall show as a footnote thereto the amount then unpaid together with any interest thereon accrued but unpaid.</p>
                <p>(c) Any loan under this section is subject to the commissioner's approval. The insurer, in advance of the loan, shall file with the commissioner a statement of the purpose of the loan and a copy of the proposed loan agreement. The loan and agreement are deemed approved unless within fifteen (15) days from the date of filing, the insurer is notified of the commissioner's disapproval and the reasons therefor. The commissioner shall disapprove any proposed loan or agreement if he finds the loan is unnecessary or excessive for the purpose intended, or that the terms of the loan agreement are not fair and equitable to the parties and to other similar lenders, if any, to the insurer, or that the information filed by the insurer is inadequate.</p>
                <p>(d) Any loan, under this section, or substantial portion thereof, to a mutual insurer shall be repaid by the insurer when no longer reasonably necessary for the purpose originally intended. No repayment of a loan shall be made by a mutual insurer unless the commissioner approves it in advance.</p>
                <p>(e) This section does not apply to other kinds of loans obtained by the insurer in ordinary course of business, nor to loans secured by pledge or mortgage of assets.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 26-24-138 with respect to nonassessable policies, each member of a domestic mutual insurer has a contingent liability, pro rata and not one (1) for another, for the discharge of its obligations.

                <p>(a) If at any time the assets of a domestic mutual insurer are less than its liabilities and the minimum amount of surplus required to be maintained by it under this code for authority to transact the kinds of insurance being transacted, and the deficiency is not secured from other sources, its directors, if approved by the commissioner, may levy an assessment only on its members who held policies providing for contingent liability at any time within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date the board of directors authorized the levy. Those members are liable to the insurer for the amount assessed.</p>
                <p>(b) The levy of assessment shall be for the amount, subject to the commissioner's approval, required to cure the deficiency and to provide a reasonable amount of working funds above the minimum amount of surplus. The working funds shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the sum of the insurer's liabilities and the minimum required surplus as of the date of the levy.</p>
                <p>(c) The assessment shall be computed upon a reasonable basis the commissioner approves in writing in advance of the levy.</p>

                <p>(a) If a domestic stock insurer's paid-in capital stock, as represented by the aggregate par value of its outstanding capital stock, or the amount of its surplus, or if the amount of a domestic mutual insurer's surplus, is less than the minimum amounts the insurer is required to maintain under this code for authority to transact the kinds of insurance being transacted, the commissioner shall at once determine the amount of deficiency and notify the insurer to cure the deficiency and file proof thereof with him within the period specified in the notice. The period shall be not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety (90) days from the date of the notice. The notice may be served by delivery to the insurer or by mailing to the insurer addressed to its principal place of business in this state.</p>

                <p>(c) After any reduction of stated capital, if the reduction results in a decrease in the number of par values of its outstanding capital stock, the insurer's stockholders shall surrender to the insurer their affected stock certificates in exchange for new certificates to be issued for such number or par value of shares, or both, as the stockholders are then entitled to receive.</p>

If any stockholder fails to pay a lawful assessment after notice given to him in person, or by mail addressed to him at his address last of record with the insurer, or in any other manner the commissioner approves, the insurer may cancel and require the return of the certificates of stock then held by the stockholder. The insurer shall issue new certificates for that number of shares as the stockholder is then entitled to upon the basis of the stockholder's proportionate interest in the amount of the insurer's capital stock as the commissioner determines to be remaining unimpaired at the time of the determination of the amount of impairment under W.S. 26-24-141, after deducting from the proportionate interest the amount of the unpaid assessment.

                <p>(i) It is equitable to stockholders and policyholders;</p>

                <p>(a) A domestic insurer may reinsure all or substantially all of its business in force, or all or substantially all of a major class thereof, with another insurer, stock or mutual, by an agreement of bulk reinsurance after compliance with this section. No agreement is effective unless it is filed with the commissioner and he approves it in writing.</p>

                <p>(i) The plan and agreement are fair and equitable to each insurer and to the policyholders involved;</p>
                <p>(ii) The reinsurance, if carried out, would not substantially reduce the protection or service to the policyholders of any domestic insurer involved;</p>
                <p>(iii) The agreement embodies adequate provisions by which the reinsuring insurer is liable to the original insureds for any loss or damage occurring under the policies reinsured in accordance with the original terms of the policies, and the reinsuring insurer shall furnish each insured with a certificate evidencing assumption of liability;</p>
                <p>(iv) The assuming reinsurer is authorized to transact insurance in this state, or is qualified for authorization and will appoint the commissioner and his successors as its irrevocable attorney for service of process, as long as any policy reinsured or claim thereunder remains in force or outstanding;</p>
                <p>(v) The reinsurance would not materially tend to lessen competition in the insurance business in this state or elsewhere as to the kinds of insurance involved, and would not materially tend to create any monopoly as to that business; and</p>
                <p>(vi) The proposed bulk reinsurance is free of other reasonable objections.</p>
                <p>(c) If the commissioner does not approve the agreement he shall immediately notify each insurer involved, in writing, specifying his reasons for disapproval.</p>
                <p>(d) If for reinsurance of any of the business in force of a mutual insurer at a time when the insurer's surplus is not impaired, the plan and agreement for reinsurance shall be approved by vote of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the mutual insurer's members voting thereon at a meeting of members called for that purpose, pursuant to any reasonable notice and procedure provided for in the agreement. If a life insurer, the right to vote may be limited to members whose policies are other than term or group policies and have been in effect for more than one (1) year.</p>
                <p>(e) No director, officer, agent or employee of any insurer party to the reinsurance, nor any other person, shall receive any compensation for arranging the bulk reinsurance other than as provided in the agreement submitted to and approved by the commissioner.</p>

                <p>(a) If a domestic mutual insurer is liquidated, its assets remaining after discharge of its indebtedness, policy obligations, repayment of contributed or borrowed surplus, if any, and expenses of administration, shall be distributed to currently existing persons who were members of the insurer for at least one (1) year and who were its members at any time within thirty-six (36) months preceding the date the liquidation was authorized or ordered, or the date of last termination of the insurer's certificate of authority, whichever is earlier. If the commissioner has reason to believe that the insurer's management caused or encouraged a reduction in the number of the insurer's members in anticipation of liquidation and for the purpose of reducing thereby the number of persons entitled to share in distribution of the insurer's assets, he may enlarge the thirty-six (36) month qualification period by any additional period he deems reasonable.</p>
                <p>(b) The insurer shall make a reasonable classification of its policies held by the members specified in subsection (a) of this section and a formula based upon that classification for determining the equitable distributive share of each such member.

                <p>(a) For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information obtained by the beneficial owner, director or officer because of his relationship to the insurer, any profit the beneficial owner, director or officer realizes from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security of the insurer within any period of less than six (6) months, unless the security is acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, inures to and is recoverable by the insurer, even if it is the intention of the beneficial owner, director or officer in entering into the transaction of holding the security purchased or of not repurchasing the security sold for a period exceeding six (6) months from the date of the purchase or sale, as the case may be.</p>
                <p>(b) Suit to recover the profit may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction by the insurer, or by the owner of any of the insurer's security in the name and in behalf of the insurer, if the insurer fails to bring suit within sixty (60) days from the date of request to do so or fails diligently to prosecute the suit thereafter.

                <p>(a) Upon advance approval by the subscribers' advisory committee and the commissioner, the attorney may levy assessments upon subscribers of a domestic reciprocal insurer liable therefor under the terms of their policies. The commissioner may also levy assessments upon subscribers in liquidation of the insurer.</p>
                <p>(b) Each subscriber's share of a deficiency for which an assessment is made, but not exceeding in any case his aggregate contingent liability as computed in accordance with W.S. 26-27-124, shall be computed by applying to the premium earned on the subscriber's policy or policies during the period to be covered by the assessment, the ratio of the total deficiency to the total premiums earned during that period upon all policies subject to the assessment.</p>
                <p>(c) In computing the earned premiums for the purposes of this section, the gross premium the insurer receives for the policy shall be used as a base, deducting therefrom solely charges not recurring upon the policy renewal or extension.</p>
                <p>(d) No subscriber shall have an offset against any assessment for which he is liable, because of any claim for unearned premium or losses payable.</p>

                <p>(a) If a reciprocal insurer has a surplus of assets over all liabilities at least equal to the minimum capital stock and surplus required to be maintained by a domestic stock insurer authorized to transact like kinds of insurance, upon application of the attorney and as approved by the subscribers' advisory committee, the commissioner shall issue his certificate authorizing the insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of subscribers under its policies then in force in this state and to omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state for as long as all the surplus remains unimpaired.</p>
                <p>(b) If the surplus is impaired, the commissioner shall immediately revoke the certificate. The revocation does not render subject to contingent liability any policy then in force and for the remainder of the period for which the premium has been paid. After revocation no policy shall be issued or renewed without providing for the subscriber's contingent assessment liability.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner shall not authorize a domestic reciprocal insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it qualifies to and does extinguish the liability of all its subscribers and in all the policies for all kinds of insurance it transacts. If required by the laws of another state in which the insurer is transacting insurance as an authorized insurer, the insurer may issue policies providing for the contingent liability of those of its subscribers as acquire the policies in that state, and need not extinguish the contingent liability applicable to policies previously in force in that state.</p>

                <p>(a) If under this chapter a receiver is to be appointed in delinquency proceedings for a domestic or alien insurer, the court shall appoint the commissioner as the receiver. The court shall order the commissioner immediately to take possession of the insurer's assets and to administer those assets under the court's orders.</p>
                <p>(b) As a domiciliary receiver, the commissioner is vested by operation of law with the title to all of the insurer's property, contracts and right of action and all of its books and records, wherever located, as of the date of entry of the order directing him to rehabilitate or liquidate a domestic insurer or to liquidate the United States branch of an alien insurer domiciled in this state. The commissioner may recover and take possession of the insurer's property, contracts and right of action and its books and records, except that ancillary receivers in reciprocal states, as to assets located in their states, have the rights and powers prescribed in this chapter for ancillary receivers appointed in this state as to assets located in this state.</p>

                <p>(d) The commissioner as domiciliary receiver is responsible for the proper administration of all assets coming into his possession or control. The court may require a bond from the commissioner or his deputies if deemed desirable for the protection of the assets.</p>
                <p>(e) Upon taking possession of the insurer's assets, the domiciliary receiver, subject to the court's direction, immediately shall proceed to conduct the insurer's business or to take any steps authorized by this chapter for rehabilitating, liquidating or conserving the insurer's affairs or assets.</p>
                <p>(f) In connection with delinquency proceedings, the commissioner may appoint one (1) or more special deputy commissioners to act for him and he may employ such counsel, clerks and assistants as he deems necessary.

                <p>(a) If under this chapter an ancillary receiver is to be appointed in delinquency proceedings for an insurer not domiciled in this state, the court shall appoint the commissioner as ancillary receiver. The commissioner shall file a petition requesting the appointment on the grounds set forth in W.S. 26-28-108 if:</p>
                <p>(i) He finds the insurer has sufficient assets located in this state to justify the appointment of an ancillary receiver; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Ten (10) or more persons resident in this state having claims against the insurer file a petition with the commissioner requesting the appointment of an ancillary receiver.</p>
                <p>(b) The domiciliary receiver for the purpose of liquidating an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state is vested by operation of law with the title to all of the insurer's property, contracts and rights of action and all of its books and records located in this state. The domiciliary receiver has the immediate right to recover balances due from local agents, to obtain possession of any of the insurer's books and records found in this state and to recover the insurer's other assets located in this state, except that upon the appointment of an ancillary receiver in this state, the ancillary receiver, during the ancillary receivership proceedings, has sole right to recover the other assets. The ancillary receiver, as soon as practicable, shall liquidate from the securities those special deposit claims and secured claims which are proved and allowed in the ancillary proceedings in this state and shall pay the necessary expenses of the proceedings. He shall promptly transfer all remaining assets to the domiciliary receiver.</p>
                <p>Subject to the provisions of this subsection, the ancillary receiver and his deputies have the same powers and are subject to the same duties with respect to the administration of the assets as a receiver of an insurer domiciled in this state.</p>

                <p>(a) In a delinquency proceeding against an insurer domiciled in this state, claims owing to residents of ancillary states are preferred claims if like claims are preferred under the laws of this state. All claims owing to residents or nonresidents shall be given equal priority of payment from general assets regardless of where the assets are located.</p>
                <p>(b) In a delinquency proceeding against an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state, claims owing to residents of this state shall be preferred if like claims are preferred by the laws of that state.</p>
                <p>(c) The owners of special deposit claims against an insurer for which a receiver is appointed in this or any other state shall be given priority against their special deposits in accordance with the provisions of the statutes governing the creation and maintenance of the deposits. If there is a deficiency in any deposit so that the claims secured thereby are not fully discharged, the claimants may share in the general assets, but that sharing shall be deferred until general creditors, and also claimants against other special deposits who have received smaller percentages from their special deposits, have been paid percentages of their claims equal to the percentage paid from the special deposit.</p>
                <p>(d) The owner of a secured claim against an insurer for which a receiver has been appointed in this or any other state may surrender his security and file his claim as a general creditor, or the claim may be discharged by resort to the security, in which case the deficiency, if any, shall be treated as a claim against the insurer's general assets on the same basis as claims of unsecured creditors. If the amount of the deficiency is adjudicated in ancillary proceedings as provided in this chapter, or if it is adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction in proceedings in which the domiciliary receiver has had notice and opportunity to be heard, the amounts are conclusive. Otherwise the amount shall be determined in the delinquency proceeding in a domiciliary state.</p>

                <p>(a) Any transfer of, or lien upon, an insurer's property is voidable if it is:</p>
                <p>(i) Made or created within four (4) months prior to the granting of an order to show cause under this chapter, with the intent of giving to any creditor a preference or of enabling him to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other creditor of the same class; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Accepted by the creditor having reasonable cause to believe that the preference will occur.</p>
                <p>(b) Any director, officer, employee, stockholder, member, subscriber and any other person acting on the insurer's behalf who is involved in any such act or deed and any person receiving thereby any of the insurer's property or the benefit of that property is personally liable therefor and is accountable to the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner as a receiver in any proceeding under this chapter may avoid any transfer of or lien upon an insurer's property which any creditor, stockholder, subscriber or member of the insurer might have avoided and may recover the property so transferred unless the person is a bona fide holder for value prior to the date of the entering of an order to show cause under this chapter. The property or its value may be recovered from anyone who receives it except a bona fide holder for value as specified in this subsection.</p>

                <p>(a) The priorities of distribution of general assets from the company's estate is as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) The costs and expenses of the administration, insolvency, liquidation and rehabilitation, including the claims handling expenses of the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association and of any similar organization in any other state as prescribed in W.S. 26-31-101 through 26-31-117;</p>
                <p>(ii) Wages actually owing to employees, other than officers of insurers, for services rendered within three (3) months prior to the date of commencement of a proceeding against the insurer under this chapter, but not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) to each employee and secured claims, including claims for taxes and debts due the federal or any state or local government which are secured by liens perfected prior to the commencement of delinquency proceedings;</p>
                <p>(iii) Claims by policyholders, beneficiaries, insureds and liability claims against insureds covered under insurance policies and insurance contracts issued by the company, as set forth in W.S. 26-28-114 through 26-28-117 and claims of the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association and any similar organization in another state as prescribed in W.S. 26-31-110;</p>
                <p>(iv) All other claims of general creditors not falling within any other priority under this section, including claims for taxes and debts due the federal government or any state or local government which are not secured claims;</p>
                <p>(v) Claims of guarantee association certificate holders, guarantee capital shareholders and surplus note holders;</p>
                <p>(vi) Proprietary claims of shareholders, members or other owners.</p>
                <p>(b) Upon the issuance of an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency against a domestic company, the commissioner shall apply to the court requesting authority to disburse funds to the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association out of the company's marshaled assets as funds become available in amounts equal to disbursements made by the association for claims handling expense and covered claims obligations on the presentation of evidence that the association made disbursements. The commissioner shall:</p>
                <p>(i) In the application request authority to make disbursements to similar organizations in other states provided the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association is entitled to like payment under the laws of the similar organization's state of domicile with respect to insolvent companies domiciled in that state;</p>
                <p>(ii) In determining the amounts available for disbursements to the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association and similar organizations in other states, reserve sufficient assets for the payment of the expenses of administration;</p>
                <p>(iii) Establish procedures for the ratable allocation of disbursements to the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association and similar organizations in other states; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Secure from the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association and each eligible similar organization in other states as a condition to advances in reimbursement of covered claims obligations an agreement to return to the commissioner on demand funds previously advanced as may be required to pay claims of secured creditors and claims falling within the priorities established in paragraphs (a)(ii) and (iii) of this section in accordance with such priorities.</p>

                <p>(b) No offset shall be allowed in favor of any person specified in subsection (a) of this section if:</p>
                <p>(i) The insurer's obligation to that person, at the date of the entry of any liquidation order or otherwise, as provided in W.S. 26-28-123, does not entitle him to share as a claimant in the insurer's assets;</p>
                <p>(ii) The insurer's obligation to that person is purchased by or transferred to that person with a view of its being used as an offset; or</p>

                <p>(a) No contingent and unliquidated claim shall share in a distribution of an insurer's assets if that insurer is adjudicated to be insolvent by an order made pursuant to this chapter, except that the claim shall be considered, if properly presented, and may be allowed to share if:</p>
                <p>(i) The claim is absolute against the insurer on or before the last day for filing claims against the insurer's assets; or</p>
                <p>(ii) There is a surplus and the liquidation is thereafter conducted upon the basis that the insurer is solvent.</p>
                <p>(b) If an insurer is adjudicated to be insolvent, any person who has a cause of action against an insured of that insurer, under a liability insurance policy issued by the insurer, may file a claim in the liquidation proceeding, regardless of the fact that the claim is contingent, and the claim may be allowed if:</p>
                <p>(i) It may be reasonably inferred from the proof presented upon the claim that the person would be able to obtain a judgment upon the cause of action against the insured;</p>
                <p>(ii) The person furnishes suitable proof, unless the court for good cause shown otherwise directs, that no further valid claim against the insurer arising out of his cause of action other than those already presented can be made; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The insurer's total liability to all claimants arising out of the same act of its insured is no greater than its maximum liability would be were it not in liquidation.</p>
                <p>(c) No judgment against an insured taken after the date of entry of the liquidation order shall be considered in the liquidation proceedings as evidence of liability, or of the amount of damages. No judgment against an insured taken by default or by collusion prior to the entry of the liquidation order shall be considered as conclusive evidence in the liquidation proceedings, either of the liability of the insured to the person upon the cause of action or of the amount of damages to which the person is entitled.</p>
                <p>(d) No claim of any secured claimant shall be allowed at a sum greater than the difference between the value of the claim without security and the value of the security itself as of the date of the entry of the order of liquidation or any other date the court sets for determining rights and liabilities as provided in W.S. 26-28-123 unless the claimant surrenders his security to the commissioner, in which case the claim shall be allowed in the full amount for which it is valued.</p>

                <p>(a) If upon the entry of a liquidation order under this chapter or at any time thereafter during liquidation proceedings the insurer is not clearly solvent, the court, upon hearing after notice it deems proper, shall enter an order adjudging the insurer to be insolvent.</p>
                <p>(b) After the entry of the order of insolvency, regardless of any prior notice given to creditors, the commissioner shall notify all persons who may have claims against the insurer to file the claims with him, at a place and within the time specified in the notice, or that the claims are forever barred. The time specified in the notice shall be as fixed by the court for filing of claims but not less than six (6) months after the entry of the insolvency order. The notice shall be given in a manner and for a reasonable period of time as the court orders.</p>
                <p>(c) Any time after the last day fixed for the filing of proofs of claims in the liquidation of a domestic company, the court, upon the commissioner's application, may authorize him to declare out of the funds remaining in his hands, one (1) or more dividends upon all claims allowed in accordance with the priorities established in W.S. 26-28-125.</p>
                <p>(d) If there has been no adjudication of insolvency, the commissioner shall pay all allowed claims in full in accordance with the priorities set forth in W.S. 26-28-125. The commissioner is not chargeable for any assets distributed to any claimant who fails to file a proper proof of claim before the distribution is made.</p>
                <p>(e) If after an insolvency adjudication, a surplus is found to exist after the payment in full of all allowed claims falling within the priorities set forth in W.S. 26-28-125(a)(i) through (iv) and which were filed prior to the last date fixed for the filing thereof, and after the setting aside of a reserve for all additional costs and expenses of the proceeding, the court shall set a new date for the filing of claims. After the expiration of the new date, all allowed claims filed on or before the new date together with all previously allowed claims falling within the priorities set forth in W.S. 26-28-125(a)(v) and (vi) shall be paid in accordance with the priorities set forth in W.S. 26-28-125.</p>
                <p>(f) The commissioner may deposit to his credit any dividends which he holds and remain unclaimed or unpaid for six (6) months after the final distribution order. The dividends shall be held in trust for the person entitled thereto, but that person is not entitled to any interest on the deposit. All such deposits are entitled to priority of payment in case of the depository's insolvency or voluntary or involuntary liquidation on an equal basis with any other priority given by the banking law. Those funds together with interest, if any, paid or credited thereon, remaining and unclaimed in the commissioner's hands in trust after two (2) years are presumed abandoned, shall be reported and delivered to the state treasurer and are subject to W.S. 9-5-203.</p>

                <p>(a) Upon the filing and reading of the report and petition provided for in W.S. 26-28-129, the court, ex parte, may order the commissioner to assess all the insurer's members or subscribers who are subject to assessment, in an aggregate amount as the court finds reasonably necessary to pay all valid claims as may be timely filed and proved in the delinquency proceedings, together with the costs and expenses of levying and collecting assessments and the costs and expenses of the delinquency proceedings in full. The order shall require that each member or subscriber be assessed for his proportion of the aggregate assessment, according to a reasonable classification of the members or subscribers and formula as the commissioner determines and the court approves.</p>
                <p>(b) The court may order additional assessments upon the filings and reading of any amendment or supplement to the report and petition referred to in subsection (a) of this section, if the amendment or supplement is filed within three (3) years after the date of entry of the rehabilitation or liquidation order.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner shall levy and assess members or subscribers in accordance with any order entered under this section.</p>
                <p>(d) The total of all assessments against any member or subscriber with respect to any policy shall be for no greater amount than that specified in the member's or subscriber's policy and as limited under this code, except as to any policy which was issued at a rate of premium below the minimum rate lawfully permitted for the risk insured, in which case the assessment against any such policyholder shall be upon the basis of the minimum rate for that risk.</p>
                <p>(e) No assessment shall be levied against any member or subscriber with respect to any nonassessable policy issued in accordance with this code.</p>

                <p>(a) Any assessment of a subscriber or member of an insurer which the commissioner makes pursuant to the court order fixing the aggregate amount of the assessment against all members or subscribers and approving the commissioner's classification and formula under W.S. 26-28-130(a) is prima facie correct.</p>
                <p>(b) Each member or subscriber shall be notified of the amount of his assessment by written notice mailed to the member's or subscriber's address last of record with the insurer. Failure of the member or subscriber to receive the notice so mailed, within the time specified therein or at all, is not a defense in any proceeding to collect the assessment.</p>
                <p>(c) If any member or subscriber fails to pay the assessment within the period specified in the notice, which period shall not be less than twenty (20) days from the date of mailing the notice, the commissioner may obtain an order in the delinquency proceedings requiring the member or subscriber to show cause at a time and place fixed by the court why judgment should not be entered against the member or subscriber for the amount of the assessment together with all costs. A copy of the order and a copy of the petition therefor shall be served upon the member or subscriber within the time and in the manner designated in the order.</p>
                <p>(d) If the subscriber or member after service of a copy of the order and petition referred to in subsection (c) of this section is made upon him:</p>
                <p>(i) Fails to appear at the time and place specified in the order, judgment shall be entered against him as prayed for in the petition; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Appears in the manner and form required by law in response to the order, the court shall hear and determine the matter and enter a judgment in accordance with its decision.</p>
                <p>(e) The commissioner may collect any assessment through any other lawful means.</p>

                  <p>(a) The officers and members of the supreme governing body or any subordinate body of a society shall not be personally liable for any benefits provided by a society.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any person may be indemnified and reimbursed by any society for expenses reasonably incurred by, and liabilities imposed upon, the person in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, or threat thereof, in which the person may be involved by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the society or of any firm, corporation or organization which he served in any capacity at the request of the society. Unless the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society and, in a criminal action or proceeding, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, a person shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed:</p>
                  <p>(i) In relation to any matter in an action, suit or proceeding as to which he shall finally be adjudged to be or have been guilty of breach of a duty as a director, officer, employee or agent of the society; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In relation to any matter in an action, suit or proceeding, or threat thereof, which has been made the subject of a compromise settlement.</p>
                  <p>(c) The determination whether the conduct of a person met the standard required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement in relation to any matter described in paragraph (b)(i) or (ii) of this section may only be made by the supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding or by a court of competent jurisdiction. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, as to the person shall not in itself create a conclusive presumption that the person did not meet the standard of conduct required in order to justify indemnification and reimbursement. The foregoing right of indemnification and reimbursement shall not be exclusive of other rights to which the person may be entitled as a matter of law and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors and administrators.</p>
                  <p>(d) A society may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the society, or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other firm, corporation or organization against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by him in any official capacity or arising out of his status as enumerated above, whether or not the society would have the power to indemnify the person against the liability under this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) Ten (10) or more citizens of the United States, a majority of whom are citizens of this state, who desire to form a fraternal benefit society, may make, sign and acknowledge before some officer competent to take acknowledgement of deeds, articles of incorporation, in which shall be stated:</p>
                  <p>(i) The proposed corporate name of the society, which shall not so closely resemble the name of any society or insurance company as to be misleading or confusing;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The purposes for which it is being formed and the mode in which its corporate powers are to be exercised. The purposes shall not include more liberal powers than are granted by this chapter;</p>

                  <p>(b) The articles of incorporation, duly certified copies of the society's bylaws and rules, copies of all proposed forms of certificates, applications therefor, and circulars to be issued by the society and a bond conditioned upon the return to applicants of the advanced payments if the organization is not completed within one (1) year shall be filed with the commissioner, who may require further information as the commissioner deems necessary. The bond with sureties approved by the commissioner shall be in an amount, not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) nor more than one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00), as required by the commissioner. All documents filed are to be in the English language. If the purposes of the society conform to the requirements of this chapter and all provisions of the law have been complied with, the commissioner shall so certify, retain and file the articles of incorporation and furnish the incorporators a preliminary certificate of authority authorizing the society to solicit members as hereinafter provided.</p>
                  <p>(c) No preliminary certificate of authority granted under the provisions of this section shall be valid after one (1) year from its date or after an additional period, not exceeding one (1) year, as may be authorized by the commissioner upon cause shown, unless the five hundred (500) applicants required in subsection (d) of this section have been secured and the organization has been completed as provided in this chapter. The articles of incorporation and all other proceedings thereunder shall become null and void in one (1) year from the date of the preliminary certificate of authority, or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society has completed its organization and received a certificate of authority to do business as provided in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon receipt of a preliminary certificate of authority from the commissioner, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one (1) regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates, and shall issue to each applicant a receipt for the amount so collected. No society shall incur any liability other than for the return of the advance premium, nor issue any certificate, nor pay, allow or offer or promise to pay or allow, any benefit to any person until:</p>
                  <p>(i) Actual bona fide applications for benefits have been secured on not less than five hundred (500) applicants, and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society;</p>
                  <p>(ii) At least ten (10) subordinate lodges have been established into which the five hundred (500) applicants have been admitted;</p>
                  <p>(iii) There has been submitted to the commissioner, under oath of the president or secretary, or corresponding officer of the society, a list of applicants, giving their names, addresses, date each was admitted, name and number of the subordinate lodge of which each applicant is a member, amount of benefits to be granted and premiums therefor; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The commissioner receives a sworn statement of the treasurer, or corresponding officer of the society, that at least five hundred (500) applicants have each paid in cash at least one (1) regular monthly premium, which premiums in the aggregate shall amount to at least one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00). The advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization and if the society has not qualified for a certificate of authority within one (1) year, the premiums shall be returned to the applicants.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commissioner may make an examination and require further information as he deems advisable. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that the society has complied with all the provisions of law, the commissioner shall issue to the society a certificate of authority to that effect and that the society is authorized to transact business pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The certificate of authority shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of the society at the date of the certificate. The commissioner shall cause a record of the certificate of authority to be made. A certified copy of the record may be given in evidence with like effect as the original certificate of authority.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any incorporated society authorized to transact business in this state at the time this act becomes effective shall not be required to reincorporate.</p>

                  <p>(a) A domestic society may amend its laws in accordance with the provisions thereof by action of its supreme governing body at any regular or special meeting thereof or, if its laws so provide, by referendum. The referendum may be held in accordance with the provisions of its laws by the vote of delegates or representatives of voting members or by the vote of local lodges.

The affidavit of any officer of the society or of anyone authorized by it to mail any amendments or synopsis thereof, stating facts which show that the amendments or a synopsis thereof have been addressed and mailed, shall be prima facie evidence that the amendments or synopsis thereof, have been furnished the addressee.</p>
                  <p>(d) Every foreign or alien society authorized to do business in this state shall file with the commissioner a certified copy of all amendments of, or additions to, its laws within ninety (90) days after the enactment of the amendments or additions to its laws.</p>

                  <p>(a) A domestic society may, by a reinsurance agreement, cede any individual risk or risks in whole or in part to an insurer, other than another fraternal benefit society, having the power to make reinsurance and authorized to do business in this state, or if not so authorized, one which is approved by the commissioner, but no domestic society may reinsure substantially all of its insurance in force without the written permission of the commissioner. It may take credit for the reserves on ceded risks to the extent reinsured, but no credit shall be allowed as an admitted asset or as a deduction from liability, to a ceding society for reinsurance made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming effective after the effective date of this act, unless the reinsurance is payable by the assuming insurer on the basis of the liability of the ceding society under the contract or contracts reinsured without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding society.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (a) of this section, a society may reinsure the risks of another society in a consolidation or merger approved by the commissioner under W.S. 26-29-214.</p>

                  <p>(a) A domestic society may consolidate or merge with any other society by complying with the provisions of this section. It shall file with the commissioner:</p>
                  <p>(i) A certified copy of the written contract containing in full the terms and conditions of the consolidation or merger;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A sworn statement by the president and secretary or corresponding officers of each society showing the financial condition thereof on a date fixed by the commissioner but not earlier than December 31 next preceding the date of the contract;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A certificate of the officers, verified by their respective oaths, that the consolidation or merger has been approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the supreme governing body of each society, the vote being conducted at a regular or special meeting of each supreme governing body, or, if the society's laws permit, by mail; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Evidence that at least sixty (60) days prior to the action of the supreme governing body of each society, the text of the contract has been furnished to all members of each society either by mail or by publication in full in the official publication of each society.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the commissioner finds that the contract conforms with this section, that the financial statements are correct and that the consolidation or merger is just and equitable to the members of each society, the commissioner shall approve the contract and issue a certificate to that effect. Upon approval, the contract shall be in full force and effect unless any society which is a party to the contract is incorporated under the laws of any other state or territory. In that event the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved as provided by the laws of that state or territory and a certificate of approval filed with the commissioner of this state or, if the laws of the state or territory contain no applicable provision, then the consolidation or merger shall not become effective unless and until it has been approved by the commissioner of that state or territory and certificate of approval filed with the commissioner of this state. In case the contract is not approved it shall be inoperative, and the fact of the submission and its contents shall not be disclosed by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon consolidation or merger becoming effective as herein provided, all the rights, franchises and interests of the consolidated or merged societies in and to every species of property, real, personal or mixed, and things in action shall be vested in the society resulting from or remaining after the consolidation or merger without any other instrument, except that conveyances of real property may be evidenced by proper deeds, and the title to any real estate or interest therein, vested under the laws of this state in any of the societies consolidated or merged, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the consolidation or merger, but shall vest absolutely in the society resulting from or remaining after such consolidation or merger.</p>
                  <p>(d) The affidavit of any officer of the society or of anyone authorized by it to mail any notice or document, stating that the notice or document has been addressed and mailed, shall be prima facie evidence that the notice or document has been furnished the addressees.</p>

                  <p>(a) The owner of a benefit contract shall have the right at all times to change the beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with the laws or rules of the society unless the owner waives this right by specifically requesting in writing that the beneficiary designation be irrevocable.

                  <p>(b) A society may provide for the payment of funeral benefits to the extent of the portion of any payment under a certificate as might reasonably appear to be due to any person equitably entitled thereto by reason of having incurred expense occasioned by the burial of the member, provided the payment shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).</p>
                  <p>(c) If, at the death of any member, there is no lawful beneficiary to whom the insurance benefits are payable, the amount of the benefits, except to the extent that funeral benefits may be paid as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be payable to the personal representative of the deceased insured, provided that if the owner of the certificate is other than the insured, the proceeds shall be payable to the owner.</p>

                  <p>(a) Every society authorized to do business in this state shall issue to each owner of a benefit contract a certificate specifying the amount of benefits provided thereby. The certificate, together with any riders or endorsements attached thereto, the laws of the society, the application for membership, the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant, and all amendments thereto, shall constitute the benefit contract, as of the date of issuance, between the society and the owner, and the certificate shall so state. A copy of the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, shall be endorsed upon or attached to the certificate. All statements on the application shall be representations and not warranties. Any waiver of this provision shall be void.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any changes, additions or amendments to the laws of the society duly made or enacted subsequent to the issuance of the certificate, shall bind the owner and the beneficiaries, and shall govern and control the benefit contract in all respects the same as though the changes, additions or amendments had been made prior to and were in force at the time of the application for insurance, except that no change, addition or amendments shall destroy or diminish benefits which the society contracted to give the owner as of the date of issuance.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any person upon whose life a benefit contract is issued prior to attaining the age of majority shall be bound by the terms of the application and certificate and by all the laws and rules of the society to the same extent as though the age of majority had been attained at the time of application.</p>
                  <p>(d) A society shall provide in its laws that if its reserves as to all or any class of certificates become impaired its board of directors or corresponding body may require that there shall be paid by the owner to the society the amount of the owner's equitable proportion of the deficiency as ascertained by its board, and that if the payment is not made:</p>
                  <p>(i) It shall stand as an indebtedness against the certificate and draw interest not to exceed the rate specified for certificate loans under the certificates; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In lieu of or in combination with paragraph (i) of this subsection, the owner may accept a proportionate reduction in benefits under the certificate.</p>
                  <p>(e) The society may specify the manner of the election and which alternative is to be presumed if no election is made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) Copies of any of the documents specified in this section, certified by the secretary or corresponding officer of the society, shall be received in evidence of the terms and conditions thereof.</p>
                  <p>(g) No certificate shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless a copy of the form has been filed with and approved by the commissioner in the manner provided for like policies issued by life insurers in this state. Every life, accident, health or disability insurance certificate and every annuity certificate issued on or after one (1) year from the effective date of this act shall meet the standard contract provision requirements not inconsistent with this chapter for like policies issued by life insurers in this state, except that a society may provide for a grace period for payment of premiums of one (1) full month in its certificates. The certificate shall also contain a provision stating the amount of premiums which are payable under the certificate and a provision reciting or setting forth the substance of any sections of the society's laws or rules in force at the time of issuance of the certificate which, if violated, will result in the termination or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. If the laws of the society provide for expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate shall also contain a provision that any member so expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance, shall have the privilege of maintaining the certificate in force by continuing payment of the required premium.</p>
                  <p>(h) Benefit contracts issued on the lives of persons below the society's minimum age for adult membership may provide for transfer of control of ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate. A society may require approval of an application for membership in order to effect this transfer, and may provide in all other respects for the regulation, government and control of the certificates and all rights, obligations and liabilities incident thereto and connected therewith. Ownership rights prior to the transfer shall be specified in the certificate.</p>
                  <p>(j) A society may specify the terms and conditions on which benefit contracts may be assigned.</p>

                  <p>(b) As part of the annual statement herein required, each society shall, on or before March 1, file with the commissioner a valuation of its certificates in force on the immediately preceding December 31, provided the commissioner may, in his discretion for cause shown, extend the time for filing the valuation for not more than two (2) calendar months.

                  <p>(a) The commissioner shall at once provide written notification to a society when the commissioner upon investigation finds that a domestic society:</p>
                  <p>(i) Has exceeded its powers;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Is not fulfilling its contracts in good faith;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Has a membership of less than four hundred (400) after an existence of one (1) year or more; or</p>
                  <p>(v) Is conducting business fraudulently or in a manner hazardous to its members, creditors, the public or the business.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner shall notify the society of any deficiency specified in subsection (a) of this section and state in writing the reasons why he believes the deficiency exists. The commissioner shall at once issue a written notice to the society requiring that the deficiency be corrected. After the notice the society has thirty (30) days in which to comply with the commissioner's request for correction, and if the society fails to comply, the commissioner shall notify the society of its findings of noncompliance and require the society to show cause on a date named why it should not be enjoined from carrying on any business until the violation complained of shall have been corrected, or why an action in quo warranto should not be commenced against the society.</p>
                  <p>(c) If on that date the society does not present good and sufficient reasons why it should not be so enjoined or why such action should not be commenced, the commissioner may present the facts relating thereto to the attorney general who shall, if he deems the circumstances warrant, commence an action to enjoin the society from transacting business or in quo warranto.</p>
                  <p>(d) If after a full hearing it appears that the society should be enjoined from transacting business or liquidated or a receiver appointed, the court shall enter the necessary order. No society enjoined under this subsection may do business until:</p>
                  <p>(i) The commissioner finds that the violation complained of has been corrected;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The costs of the action have been paid by the society if the court finds that the society was in default as charged;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The court has dissolved its injunction; and</p>

                  <p>(e) If the court orders the society liquidated, it shall be enjoined from carrying on any further business, whereupon the receiver of the society shall proceed at once to take possession of the books, papers, money and other assets of the society and, under the direction of the court, proceed forthwith to close the affairs of the society and to distribute its funds to those entitled thereto.</p>
                  <p>(f) No action under this section shall be recognized in any court of this state unless brought by the attorney general upon request of the commissioner. Whenever a receiver is to be appointed for a domestic society, the court shall appoint the commissioner as receiver.</p>

After the notice the society has thirty (30) days in which to comply with the commissioner's request for correction, and if the society fails to comply, the commissioner shall notify the society of findings of noncompliance and require the society to show cause on a date named why its license should not be suspended, revoked or refused. If on that date the society does not present a good and sufficient reason why its authority to do business in this state should not be suspended, revoked or refused, the commissioner may suspend or refuse the license of the society to do business in this state until satisfactory evidence is furnished to the commissioner that the suspension or refusal should be withdrawn or the commissioner may revoke the authority of the society to do business in this state.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing contained in this section shall be taken or construed as preventing any society from continuing in good faith all contracts made in this state during the time such society was legally authorized to transact business herein.</p>
                  <p>(d) In making the finding allowed by subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may consider the factors specified in W.S. 26-3-116(c) and 26-3-132(a) and, upon finding a deficiency, may issue an order consistent with W.S. 26-3-132(b) and pursuant to the procedure established in W.S. 26-3-132(c).</p>

                <p>(a) The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year. Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than thirty (30) days before it is due. No member insurer shall be assessed in any year an amount greater than one percent (1%) of that member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year. If the maximum assessment, together with the other association assets, do not provide in any one (1) year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments, the funds available shall be prorated and the unpaid portions shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available.</p>
                <p>(b) The association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. During the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. The payments shall be refunded to those companies receiving larger assessments because of the deferment, or, if the company elects, credited against future assessments.</p>

The plan of operation and any amendments thereto are effective upon the commissioner's written approval.</p>
                <p>(b) If the association fails to submit a suitable plan of operation or if at any time the association fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the commissioner, after notice and hearing, shall promulgate any reasonable rules necessary or advisable to carry out the provisions of this chapter.

                <p>(a) The commissioner shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Notify the association of an insolvent insurer's existence not later than three (3) days after he receives notice of the insolvency determination;</p>
                <p>(ii) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the association with a statement of the net direct written premiums of each member insurer;</p>
                <p>(iii) Require that the association notify the insolvent insurer's insureds and any other interested parties of the insolvency determination and of their rights under this chapter. The notification shall be by mail at their last known address, if available, but if sufficient information for notification by mail is not available, notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation is sufficient.</p>
                <p>(b) The commissioner may:</p>
                <p>(i) After notice and hearing:</p>
                <p>(A) Suspend or revoke the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation; or</p>
                <p>(B) Levy a fine on any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due, which fine shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the unpaid assessment per month, except that no fine shall be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.</p>
                <p>(ii) Revoke the designation of any servicing facility if he finds claims are being handled unsatisfactorily;</p>
                <p>(iii) Require each agent of the insolvent insurer to give prompt written notice by first class mail, at the insured's last known address, to each insured of the insolvent insurer for whom he was agent of record.</p>
                <p>(c) Any final action or order of the commissioner under this chapter is subject to review in accordance with W.S. 26-2-129.</p>

                <p>(a) Any person recovering under this chapter assigns his rights under the policy to the association to the extent of his recovery from the association. Any insured or claimant seeking the protection of this chapter shall cooperate with the association to the same extent as that person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer. The association has no cause of action against the insolvent insurer's insured for any sums it has paid out except the causes of action as the insolvent insurer would have had if it had paid those sums. If an insolvent insurer is operating on a plan with assessment liability, payments of association claims do not reduce the insureds' liability to the receiver, liquidator or statutory successor for unpaid assessments.</p>
                <p>(b) The receiver, liquidator or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer is bound by settlements of covered claims by the association or a similar organization in another state. The court having jurisdiction shall grant those claims priority equal to that which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this chapter against the insolvent insurer's assets.</p>
                <p>The expense of the association or similar organization in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the liquidator's expenses.</p>
                <p>(c) The association shall periodically file with the insolvent insurer's receiver or liquidator:</p>
                <p>(i) Statements of the covered claims the association pays; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Estimates of anticipated claims on the association which preserve the association's rights against the insolvent insurer's assets.</p>

                <p>(a) Any person having a claim against an insurer under an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer which is also a covered claim, shall first exhaust his right under the policy. Any amount payable on a covered claim under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery under the insurance policy.</p>
                <p>(b) Any person having a claim which may be recovered under more than one (1) insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall seek recovery first from the association of the insured's place of residence, except that if it is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he shall seek recovery first from the association of the location of the property. If it is a worker's compensation claim, he shall seek recovery first from the association of the claimant's residence. Any recovery under this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent.</p>

                <p>(i) The board of directors shall:</p>
                <p>(A) Upon majority vote, notify the commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public;</p>
                <p>(B) At the conclusion of any insurer insolvency in which the association is obligated to pay covered claims, prepare and submit to the commissioner, a report on the history and causes of the insolvency as determined by the available information.</p>
                <p>(ii) The board of directors, upon majority vote, may:</p>
                <p>(A) Request that the commissioner order an examination, as specified in subsection (b) of this section of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public;</p>
                <p>(B) Make reports and recommendations to the commissioner upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member insurer, and the reports and recommendations are not public documents;</p>
                <p>(C) Make recommendations to the commissioner for the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies.</p>
                <p>(iii) It is the commissioner's duty to report to the board of directors when he has reasonable cause to believe that any member insurer examined or being examined at the board of directors' request may be insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to the policyholders or the public.</p>
                <p>(b) Within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of a request for examination as specified in subparagraph (a)(ii)(A) of this section, the commissioner shall begin the examination. The examination may be conducted as a National Association of Insurance Commissioners' examination or may be conducted by any qualified persons the commissioner designates. The cost of the examination shall be paid by the association, and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports. The examination report shall not be released to the board of directors prior to its release to the public, but this does not preclude the commissioner from complying with paragraph (a)(iii) of this section. The commissioner shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed. The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the commissioner but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public.</p>

                <p>(a) There is created a medical liability compensation account, the monies of which shall be collected by the commissioner for exclusive use for the purposes stated in this chapter. The account and any investment income from it shall be held in trust and invested and reinvested by the state treasurer pursuant to W.S. 9-4-715(a), (d) and (e).</p>
                <p>(b) The commissioner may use account monies to purchase insurance for the account and its obligations. The commissioner shall be notified of a suit within thirty (30) days from the date the suit is filed. The commissioner may participate in a physician's defense if any claim is sufficient to be a potential liability against the account. Reasonable legal expenses the board approves and the commissioner incurs in defense against any malpractice claim are payable out of the account.</p>
                <p>(c) To create the account, all physicians qualified under W.S. 26-33-102, practicing in Wyoming and who elect to participate, shall pay an annual surcharge. The commissioner shall determine the surcharge based upon sound actuarial principles using data obtained from Wyoming experience. The surcharge shall not exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the cost to each physician for a basic fifty thousand dollar ($50,000.00) malpractice insurance premium and shall be collected on the same basis as premiums by each insurer from the physician.</p>
                <p>(d) The surcharge is due and payable within thirty (30) days after the insurer receives the premiums for malpractice liability insurance from the practicing physician in Wyoming. The commissioner shall send to each insurer a statement explaining the provisions of this section together with any other information necessary for their compliance with this section.</p>
                <p>(e) If the insurer collects the annual premium surcharge but does not pay it to the state within the stated time limit, the commissioner may suspend the insurer's certificate of authority until the annual premium surcharge is paid.</p>
                <p>(f) All expenses of collecting, protecting and administering the account or related to the purchase of insurance for the account shall be paid from the account. The commissioner may employ financial, administrative or legal consultants to assist in the account management.</p>
                <p>(g) If the account balance exceeds four million dollars ($4,000,000.00) at the end of any calendar year after payment of all claims and expenses, the commissioner shall reduce the surcharge to maintain the account at an approximate level of four million dollars ($4,000,000.00).</p>
                <p>(h) The commissioner shall purchase reinsurance, if needed, to protect the account from depletion due to judgment against it. The reinsurance so purchased shall cover each qualified physician from two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) to one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per year. Cost of reinsurance shall be paid from the monies of the account.</p>

                <p>(B) Four percent (4%) of annual hospital expenditures paid on a managed hospital payment basis as reported on the most recent financial statement filed with the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(c) A health maintenance organization licensed before July 1, 1995 shall maintain a minimum net worth of:</p>
                <p>(i) Twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount required by subsection (b) of this section by December 31, 1995;</p>

                <p>(iv) One hundred percent (100%) of the amount required by subsection (b) of this section by December 31, 1998.</p>
                <p>(d) In determining net worth, no debt shall be considered fully subordinated unless the subordination clause is in a form acceptable to the commissioner. Any interest obligation relating to the repayment of any subordinated debt must be similarly subordinated.</p>
                <p>(e) The interest expenses relating to the repayment of any fully subordinated debt shall be considered covered expenses.</p>
                <p>(f) Any fully subordinated debt incurred by a note meeting the requirements of subsections (d) and (e) of this section, and otherwise acceptable to the commissioner, shall not be considered a liability and shall be recorded as equity.</p>
                <p>(g) Unless otherwise provided in this section, each health maintenance organization shall deposit with the commissioner or, at the discretion of the commissioner, with any organization or trustee acceptable to him through which a custodial or controlled account is utilized, cash, securities or any combination of these or other measures that are acceptable to him which at all times shall have a value of not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00).</p>
                <p>(h) An organization that is in operation on July 1, 1995, shall make a deposit of cash, securities, combination thereof or other measures of equal amount acceptable to the commissioner of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) on or before August 1, 1995, and an additional deposit of cash, securities, combination thereof or other measures of equal amount acceptable to the commissioner of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) on or before July 1, 1996.</p>
                <p>(j) The deposit shall be an admitted asset of the health maintenance organization in the determination of net worth. All income from deposits belongs to the depositing organization, shall be paid to it as it becomes available and shall be an asset of the organization. A health maintenance organization that has made a securities deposit may withdraw that deposit or any part thereof after making a substitute deposit of cash, securities or any combination thereof or other measures of equal amount and value. Any securities shall be approved by the commissioner before being substituted.</p>
                <p>(k) The deposit shall be used to protect the interests of the health maintenance organization's enrollees and to assure continuation of health care services to enrollees of a health maintenance organization which is in rehabilitation or conservation. The commissioner may use the deposit for administrative costs directly attributable to a receivership or liquidation. If the health maintenance organization is placed in receivership or liquidation, the deposit shall be an asset subject to chapter 28 of this code.</p>
                <p>(m) The commissioner may reduce or eliminate any of the deposit requirements set forth in this section if he is satisfied that the health maintenance organization has deposited with the state treasurer, insurance commissioner, or other official body of the state or jurisdiction of domicile for the protection of all subscribers and enrollees, wherever located, of the health maintenance organization, cash, acceptable securities or surety, and delivers to the commissioner a certificate to that effect, duly authenticated by the appropriate state official holding the deposit.</p>
                <p>(n) Every health maintenance organization shall, when determining liabilities, include an amount estimated in the aggregate to provide for any unearned premium and for the payment of all claims for health care expenditures which have been incurred, whether reported or unreported, which are unpaid and for which the organization is or may be liable, and to provide for the expense of adjustment or settlement of those claims. The liabilities shall be computed in accordance with accounting principles established by the commissioner upon reasonable consideration of the ascertained experience and character of the health maintenance organization.</p>
                <p>(o) Every contract between a health maintenance organization and a participating provider of health care services shall be in writing and shall set forth that in the event the health maintenance organization fails to pay for health care services as set forth in the contract, the subscriber or enrollee shall not be liable to the provider for any sums owed by the health maintenance organization.</p>
                <p>(p) In the event that the participating provider contract has not been reduced to writing as required by this section or that the contract fails to contain the required prohibition, the participating provider shall not collect or attempt to collect from the subscriber or enrollee sums owed by the health maintenance organization.</p>
                <p>(q) No participating provider, or agent, trustee or assignee thereof, may maintain any action at law against a subscriber or enrollee to collect sums owed by the health maintenance organization.</p>
                <p>(r) The commissioner shall require that each health maintenance organization have a plan for handling insolvency which allows for continuation of benefits for the duration of the contract period for which premiums have been paid and continuation of benefits to members who are confined on the date of insolvency in an inpatient facility until their discharge or expiration of benefits. In considering such a plan, the commissioner may require:</p>
                <p>(i) Insurance to cover the expenses to be paid for continued benefits after an insolvency;</p>
                <p>(ii) Provisions in provider contracts that obligate the provider to provide services for the duration of the period after the health maintenance organization's insolvency for which premium payment has been made and until the enrollees' discharge from inpatient facilities;</p>
                <p>(iii) Insolvency reserves;</p>
                <p>(iv) Acceptable letters of credit;</p>
                <p>(v) Any other arrangements to assure that benefits are continued as specified in this subsection.</p>
                <p>(s) An agreement to provide health care services between a provider and a health maintenance organization shall require that if the provider terminates the agreement, the provider shall give the organization at least sixty (60) days advance notice of termination.</p>

                <p>(a) If at any time uncovered expenditures exceed ten percent (10%) of total health care expenditures, a health maintenance organization shall place an uncovered expenditures insolvency deposit with the commissioner, or with any organization or trustee acceptable to the commissioner through which a custodial or controlled account is maintained, cash or securities that are acceptable to the commissioner. The deposit shall at all times have a fair market value in an amount of one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the organization's outstanding liability for uncovered expenditures for enrollees in this state, including incurred but not reported claims, and shall be calculated as of the first day of the month and maintained for the remainder of the month. If a health maintenance organization is not otherwise required to file a quarterly report, it shall file a report within forty-five (45) days of the end of the calendar quarter with information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with this section.</p>
                <p>(b) The deposit required under this section is in addition to the deposit required under W.S. 26-34-114(g) and (h) and is an admitted asset of the health maintenance organization in the determination of net worth. All income from such deposits or trust account shall be assets of the health maintenance organization and may be withdrawn quarterly with the approval of the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(c) A health maintenance organization that has made a deposit may withdraw that deposit or any part of the deposit if:</p>
                <p>(i) A substitute deposit of cash or securities of equal amount and value is made;</p>
                <p>(ii) The fair market value exceeds the amount of the required deposit; or</p>
                <p>(iii) The required deposit under subsection (a) of this section is reduced or eliminated.</p>
                <p>(d) Deposits, substitutions or withdrawals may be made only with the prior written approval of the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(e) The deposit required under this section is in trust and may be used only as provided under this section. The commissioner may use the deposit of an insolvent health maintenance organization for administrative costs associated with administering the deposit and payment of claims of enrollees of this state for uncovered expenditures in this state. Claims for uncovered expenditures shall be paid on a pro rata basis based on assets available to pay the ultimate liability for incurred expenditures. Partial distribution may be made pending final distribution. Any amount of the deposit remaining shall be paid into the liquidation or receivership of the health maintenance organization.</p>
                <p>(f) The commissioner may by regulation prescribe the time, manner and form for filing claims under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p>(g) The commissioner may by regulation or order require health maintenance organizations to file annual, quarterly or more frequent reports as he deems necessary to demonstrate compliance with this section. The commissioner may require that the reports include liability for uncovered expenditures as well as an audit opinion.</p>

                <p>(a) In the event of an insolvency of a health maintenance organization, upon order of the commissioner all other carriers that participated in the enrollment process with the insolvent health maintenance organization at a group's last regular enrollment period shall offer the group's enrollees of the insolvent health maintenance organization a thirty (30) day enrollment period commencing upon the date of insolvency. Each carrier shall offer the enrollees of the insolvent health maintenance organization the same coverages and rates that it had offered to the enrollees of the group at its last regular enrollment period.</p>
                <p>(b) If no other carrier had been offered to some groups enrolled in the insolvent health maintenance organization, or if the commissioner determines that the other health benefit plan lacks sufficient health care delivery resources to assure that health care services will be available and accessible to all of the group enrollees of the insolvent health maintenance organization, the commissioner shall allocate equitably the insolvent health maintenance organization's group contracts for those groups among all health maintenance organizations which operate within a portion of the insolvent health maintenance organization's service area, taking into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health maintenance organization. Each health maintenance organization to which a group is so allocated shall offer the group the health maintenance organization's existing coverage which is most similar to the group's coverage with the insolvent health maintenance organization at rates determined in accordance with the successor health maintenance organization's existing rating methodology.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner shall equitably allocate the insolvent health maintenance organization's nongroup enrollees who are unable to obtain other coverage, among all health maintenance organizations which operate within a portion of the insolvent health maintenance organization's service area, taking into consideration the health care delivery resources of each health maintenance organization. Each health maintenance organization to which nongroup enrollees are allocated shall offer the nongroup enrollees the health maintenance organization's existing coverage for individual or conversion coverage as determined by the enrollee's type of coverage in the insolvent health maintenance organization at rates determined in accordance with the successor health maintenance organization's existing rating methodology. Successor health maintenance organizations which do not offer direct nongroup enrollment may aggregate all of the allocated nongroup enrollees into one (1) group for rating and coverage purposes.</p>
                <p>(d) Any carrier providing replacement coverage with respect to group hospital, medical or surgical expense or service benefits within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of discontinuance of a prior health maintenance organization contract or policy providing the hospital, medical or surgical expense or service benefits shall immediately cover all enrollees who were validly covered under the previous health maintenance organization contract or policy at the date of discontinuance and who would otherwise be eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's contract, regardless of any provisions of the contract relating to active employment or hospital confinement or pregnancy.</p>
                <p>(e) Except to the extent benefits for the condition would have been reduced or excluded under the prior carrier's contract or policy, no provision in a succeeding carrier's contract of replacement coverage which would operate to reduce or exclude benefits on the basis that the condition giving rise to benefits preexisted the effective date of the succeeding carrier's contract shall be applied with respect to those enrollees validly covered under the prior carrier's contract or policy on the date of discontinuance.</p>

                <p>(a) No health maintenance organization, or representative thereof, shall cause or knowingly permit the use of advertising which is untrue or misleading, solicitation which is untrue or misleading or any form of evidence of coverage which is deceptive. For purposes of this chapter:</p>
                <p>(i) A statement or item of information is:</p>
                <p>(A) Untrue if it does not conform to fact in any respect which is or may be significant to an enrollee of or person considering enrollment with a health maintenance organization;</p>
                <p>(B) Misleading, whether or not it may be literally untrue, if, in the total context in which the statement is made or the item of information is communicated, the statement or item of information may be reasonably understood by a reasonable person, not possessing special knowledge regarding health care coverage, as indicating any benefit or advantage or the absence of any exclusion, limitation or disadvantage of possible significance to an enrollee of, or person considering enrollment in a health maintenance organization if the benefit or advantage or absence of limitation, exclusion or disadvantage does not in fact exist.</p>
                <p>(ii) An evidence of coverage is deceptive if the evidence of coverage taken as a whole, and with consideration given to typography and format, as well as language, is such as to cause a reasonable person, not possessing special knowledge regarding health maintenance organizations and evidences of coverage therefor, to expect benefits, services, premiums or other advantages which the evidence of coverage does not provide or which the health maintenance organization issuing the evidence of coverage does not regularly make available for enrollees covered under the evidence of coverage.</p>
                <p>(b) Chapter 13 of this code applies to health maintenance organizations and evidences of coverage except to the extent that the commissioner determines that the nature of health maintenance organizations and evidences of coverage render that chapter, or any section thereof, clearly inappropriate.</p>
                <p>(c) A health maintenance organization shall not cancel or refuse to review an enrollee, except for reasons stated in the organization's rules applicable to all enrollees or for the failure to pay the premiums for coverage, or for any other reasons the commissioner may specify by rule and regulation.</p>
                <p>(d) No health maintenance organization unless licensed as an insurer shall refer to itself as an insurer or use a name deceptively similar to the name or description of any insurance or surety corporation doing business in the state.</p>
                <p>(e) Any person not in possession of a valid certificate of authority issued pursuant to this chapter shall not use the phrase "health maintenance organization" or "HMO" in the course of operation.</p>
                <p>(f) A health care maintenance organization shall not refuse to contract with or compensate for covered services an otherwise eligible health care provider solely because that provider has in good faith communicated with one (1) or more of his current, former or prospective patients regarding the provisions, terms or requirements of the organization's products as they related to the needs of that provider's patients.</p>
                <p>(g) A health care maintenance organization shall not prohibit or restrict any health care provider from disclosing to any subscriber, enrollee or member any medically appropriate health care information the provider deems appropriate regarding the:</p>
                <p>(i) Nature of treatment, risks or alternatives;</p>
                <p>(ii) Decision of any plan to authorize or deny services;</p>
                <p>(iii) Process used to authorize or deny health care services or benefits.</p>

                <p>(i) The requirements for licensure of resident health maintenance organization producers;</p>
                <p>(ii) The conditions for entering into reciprocal agreements with other jurisdictions for the licensure of nonresident health maintenance organization producers;</p>
                <p>(iii) Any examination, prelicensing or continuing education requirements;</p>
                <p>(iv) The requirements for registering and terminating the appointment of health maintenance organization producers;</p>
                <p>(v) Any requirements for registering any assumed names or office locations in which a health maintenance organization producer does business;</p>
                <p>(vi) The conditions for health maintenance organization producer license renewal;</p>
                <p>(vii) The grounds for denial, refusal, suspension or revocation of a health maintenance organization producer's license;</p>

                <p>(ix) Any other requirement or procedure and any form reasonably necessary to provide for the effective administration of the licensing of health maintenance organization producers under this section.</p>
                <p>(b) None of the following shall be required to hold a health maintenance organization producer license:</p>
                <p>(i) Any regular salaried officer or employee of a health maintenance organization who devotes substantially all of his time to activities other than the taking or transmitting of applications or membership fees or premiums for health maintenance organization membership, or who receives no commission or other compensation directly dependent upon the business obtained and who does not solicit or accept from the public applications for health maintenance organization membership;</p>
                <p>(ii) Employers or their officers or employees or the trustees of any employee benefit plan to the extent that the employers, officers, employees or trustees are engaged in the administration or operation of any program of employee benefits involving the use of health maintenance organization memberships, provided that the employers, officers, employees or trustees are not in any manner compensated directly or indirectly by the health maintenance organization issuing the health maintenance organization memberships;</p>
                <p>(iii) Banks or their officers and employees to the extent that the banks, officers and employees collect and remit premiums by charging the same against accounts of depositors on the orders of the depositors; or</p>
                <p>(iv) Any person or the employee of any person who has contracted to provide administrative, management or health care services to a health maintenance organization and who is compensated for those services by the payment of an amount calculated as a percentage of the revenues, net income or profit of the health maintenance organization, if that method of compensation is the sole basis for subjecting that person or the employee of the person to this act.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner, by rule, may exempt certain classes of persons from the requirement of obtaining a license if:</p>
                <p>(i) The functions they perform do not require special competence, trustworthiness or the regulatory surveillance made possible by licensing; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Other existing safeguards make regulation unnecessary.</p>

                <p>(a) Any insurance company licensed in this state, or a hospital or health service corporation authorized to do business in this state, either directly or through a subsidiary or affiliate, may organize and operate a health maintenance organization under this chapter. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any two (2) or more such insurance companies, hospitals or health service corporations, or subsidiaries or affiliates thereof, may jointly organize and operate a health maintenance organization. The business of insurance is deemed to include the providing of health care by a health maintenance organization owned or operated by an insurer or a subsidiary thereof.</p>
                <p>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, any insurer or any hospital or health service corporation may contract with a health maintenance organization to provide insurance or similar protection against the cost of care provided through health maintenance organizations and to provide coverage in the event of the failure of the health maintenance organization to meet its obligations.</p>
                <p>(c) The enrollees of a health maintenance organization constitute a permissible group under this code or any other laws of this state. Among other things, under any contract specified the insurer or hospital or health service corporation may make benefit payments to health maintenance organizations for health care services rendered by providers.</p>

                <p>(a) The commissioner may make an examination of the affairs of any health maintenance organization and providers with whom that organization has contracts, agreements or other arrangements as often as is reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests of the people of this state but not less frequently than once every five (5) years.</p>
                <p>(b) The administrator may make an examination concerning the quality of health care service and the adequacy of quality assurance programs of any health maintenance organization and providers with whom that organization has contracts, agreements or other arrangements as often as is reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests of the people of this state but not less frequently than once every five (5) years.</p>
                <p>(c) Each health maintenance organization and provider shall submit its relevant books and records for the examinations specified in this section and in every way facilitate those examinations. For the purpose of examinations, the commissioner and the administrator may administer oaths to and examine the officers and agents of the health maintenance organization and the principals of any providers concerning their business.</p>
                <p>(d) Repealed by Laws 1995, ch. 210, § 3.</p>
                <p>(e) Instead of the examinations under this section the commissioner or administrator may accept the report of an examination made by the insurance commissioner or public health commissioner of another state. A report from another state's insurance commissioner shall only be accepted if:</p>
                <p>(i) The insurance department preparing the report was, at the time of the examination, accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' financial regulation standards and accreditation program; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The examination is performed under the supervision of an accredited insurance department or with the participation of one (1) or more examiners who are employed by an accredited insurance department and who, after the review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department.</p>

                <p>(a) The commissioner may suspend or revoke any certificate of authority issued to a health maintenance organization under this chapter if:</p>
                <p>(i) The commissioner finds the health maintenance organization:</p>
                <p>(A) Is operating significantly in contravention of its basic organizational document or in a manner contrary to that described in any other information submitted under W.S. 26-34-103, unless amendments to those submissions have been filed with and approved by the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(B) Issues evidence of coverage or uses a schedule of premiums for health care services which do not comply with W.S. 26-34-109;</p>
                <p>(C) Does not provide or arrange for basic or nonbasic health care services;</p>
                <p>(D) Is no longer financially responsible and is reasonably expected to be unable to meet its obligations to enrollees or prospective enrollees;</p>
                <p>(E) Has failed to correct, within the time prescribed by subsection (c) of this section, any deficiency occurring due to the health maintenance organization's prescribed minimum net worth being impaired;</p>
                <p>(F) Has failed to implement the complaint system required by W.S. 26-34-112 in a reasonable manner to resolve valid complaints;</p>
                <p>(G) Any person on its behalf, has advertised or merchandised its services in an untrue, misrepresentative, misleading, deceptive or unfair manner; or</p>
                <p>(H) Has otherwise failed substantially to comply with this chapter.</p>
                <p>(ii) The administrator certifies to the commissioner that the health maintenance organization either does not meet the requirements of W.S. 26-34-104(b) or is unable to fulfill its obligations to furnish health care services;</p>
                <p>(iii) The commissioner finds the continued operation of the health maintenance organization would be hazardous to its enrollees. The commissioner may consider the factors specified in W.S. 26-3-116(c) and 26-3-132(a) when making this finding.</p>
                <p>(b) In addition to or in lieu of suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority pursuant to this section, the applicant or health maintenance organization may be subjected to an administrative penalty of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each cause for suspension or revocation.</p>
                <p>(c) Whenever the commissioner finds that the net worth maintained by any health maintenance organization subject to the provisions of this act is less than the minimum net worth required to be maintained by W.S. 26-34-114, he shall give written notice to the health maintenance organization of the amount of the deficiency and require:</p>
                <p>(i) Filing with the commissioner a plan for correction of the deficiency acceptable to the commissioner; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Correction of the deficiency within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, unless an extension of time, not to exceed sixty (60) additional days, is granted by the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(d) A deficiency shall be deemed an impairment, and failure to correct the impairment in the prescribed time shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the certificate of authority or for placing the health maintenance organization in conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation.</p>
                <p>(e) Unless allowed by the commissioner, no health maintenance organization or person acting on its behalf may, directly or indirectly, renew, issue or deliver any certificate, agreement or contract of coverage in this state, for which a premium is charged or collected, when the health maintenance organization writing the coverage is impaired, and the impairment is known to the health maintenance organization or to the person. However, the existence of an impairment shall not prevent the issuance or renewal of a certificate, agreement or contract when the enrollee exercises an option granted under the plan to obtain a new, renewed or converted coverage.</p>
                <p>(f) A certificate of authority shall be suspended or revoked, or an administrative penalty levied pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, only after compliance with W.S. 26-34-125.</p>
                <p>(g) If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization, during the period of suspension, shall not enroll any additional enrollees except newborn children or other newly acquired dependents of existing enrollees, and shall not engage in any advertising or solicitation of any kind.</p>
                <p>(h) If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is revoked, that organization shall proceed, immediately following the effective date of the order of revocation, to wind up its affairs, and shall conduct no further business except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of its affairs. It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation of any kind. The commissioner, by written order, may permit any further operation of the organization as he finds to be in the best interest of enrollees, to the end that enrollees are afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage.</p>

                <p>(a) Any rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation of a health maintenance organization is deemed to be the rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation of an insurance company and shall be conducted under the commissioner's supervision pursuant to the provisions of this code governing the rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation of insurance companies. The commissioner may apply for an order directing him to rehabilitate, liquidate or conserve a health maintenance organization upon any one (1) or more grounds set out in chapter 28 of this code, or if in his opinion the continued operation of the health maintenance organization would be hazardous either to the enrollees or to the people of this state. Enrollees have the same priority in the event of liquidation or rehabilitation as the law provides to policyholders of an insurer.</p>
                <p>(b) For purposes of determining the priority of distribution of general assets, claims of enrollees and enrollees' beneficiaries shall have the same priority as established by chapter 28 of this code for policyholders and beneficiaries of insureds of insurance companies. If an enrollee is liable to any provider for services provided pursuant to and covered by the health care plan, that liability shall have the status of an enrollee claim for distribution of general assets.</p>
                <p>(c) Any provider who is obligated by statute or agreement to hold enrollees harmless from liability for services provided pursuant to and covered by a health care plan shall have a priority of distribution of the general assets immediately following that of enrollees and enrollees' beneficiaries as described herein, and immediately preceding the priority of distribution described in W.S. 26-28-125(a)(iv).</p>

                <p>(a) Whenever the commissioner determines that the financial condition of any health maintenance organization is such that its continued operation might be hazardous to its enrollees, creditors, or the general public, or that it has violated any provision of this act, he may, after notice and hearing, order the health maintenance organization to take action reasonably necessary to rectify the condition or violation, including but not limited to one (1) or more of the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Reduce the total amount of present and potential liability for benefits by reinsurance or other method acceptable to the commissioner;</p>

                <p>(b) For purposes of this section, the violation by a health maintenance organization of any law of this state to which the health maintenance organization is subject shall be deemed a violation of this act.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner is authorized, by rules and regulations, to set uniform standards and criteria for early warning that the continued operation of any health maintenance organization might be hazardous to its enrollees, creditors or the general public and to set standards for evaluating the financial condition of any health maintenance organization. The standards shall be consistent with the purposes expressed in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) The remedies and measures available to the commissioner under this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the remedies and measures available to the commissioner under the provisions of chapter 28 of this code.</p>

                <p>(a) If the commissioner has cause to believe that grounds for the denial of an application for a certificate of authority exist, or that grounds for the suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority or for the imposition of an administrative penalty exist, he shall notify the health maintenance organization and the administrator by written order specifically stating the grounds for denial, suspension, revocation or administrative penalty.

                <p>(b) If the health maintenance organization or applicant requests a hearing pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall issue a written notice of hearing and send it to the health maintenance organization or applicant by certified or registered mail and to the administrator stating:</p>

                <p>(c) If a hearing is requested, the administrator, or his designated representative, shall be in attendance at the hearing and shall participate in the proceedings. The administrator's recommendations and findings with respect to matters relating to the quality of health care services provided in connection with any decision regarding denial, suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority, are conclusive and binding upon the commissioner. After the hearing, or upon the failure of the health maintenance organization to appear at the hearing, the commissioner shall take action as is deemed advisable on written findings which shall be mailed to the health maintenance organization with a copy thereof to the administrator. The commissioner's action and the administrator's recommendations and findings are subject to review by the district court.

                <p>(a) The commissioner, instead of suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority under W.S. 26-34-121, may levy an administrative penalty in an amount not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) if reasonable notice in writing is given of the intent to levy the penalty and the health maintenance organization has a reasonable time within which to remedy the defect in its operations which gave rise to the penalty citation. The commissioner may augment this penalty by an amount equal to the sum that he calculates to be the damages suffered by enrollees or other members of the public.</p>
                <p>(b) If the commissioner or the administrator for any reason has cause to believe that any violation of this chapter has occurred or is threatened, the commissioner or administrator may give notice to the health maintenance organization and to the representatives, or other persons who appear to be involved in the suspected violation, to arrange a conference with the alleged violators or their authorized representatives for the purpose of attempting to ascertain the facts relating to the suspected violation, and, if it appears that any violation has occurred or is threatened, to arrive at an adequate and effective means of correcting or preventing the violation.</p>
                <p>Proceedings under this subsection shall not be governed by any formal procedural requirements, and may be conducted in a manner the commissioner or the administrator deems appropriate under the circumstances. However, unless consented to by the health maintenance organization, no rule or order shall result from a conference until the requirements of this section or W.S. 26-34-125 are satisfied.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner may issue an order directing a health maintenance organization or a representative of a health maintenance organization to cease and desist from engaging in any act or practice in violation of this chapter. Within fifteen (15) days after service of the cease and desist order, the respondent may request a hearing on the question of whether acts or practices in violation of this chapter have occurred. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, and judicial review is available as provided by that act.</p>
                <p>(d) In the case of any violation of this chapter, if the commissioner elects not to issue a cease and desist order, or in case of noncompliance with a cease and desist order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner may institute a proceeding to obtain injunctive or other appropriate relief in the district court.</p>
                <p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, if a health maintenance organization fails to comply with the net worth requirement of this act, the commissioner is authorized to take appropriate action to assure that the continued operation of the health maintenance organization will not be hazardous to its enrollees.</p>

                <p>(a) To assure the faithful performance of obligations under insolvency, each mechanical breakdown insurance organization certified under W.S. 26-37-106 shall deposit and maintain with the commissioner, trust securities of the type eligible as investments by insurers under chapter 7 of this code. The trust securities required by this section shall at all times have the following market value:</p>
                <p>(i) For an organization not transacting mechanical breakdown insurance in this state prior to January 1, 1987 and before issuing a certificate of authority under this chapter and receiving premiums, an initial amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00);</p>
                <p>(ii) For an organization transacting mechanical breakdown insurance in this state prior to January 1, 1987 and having in force less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) of gross written premiums, membership fees or similar charges, a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of the gross premiums in force or fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), whichever is less;</p>
                <p>(iii) For an organization transacting mechanical breakdown insurance in this state prior to January 1, 1987 and having in force more than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) but less than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) of gross written premiums, membership fees or similar charges in this state, an amount not less than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00); and</p>
                <p>(iv) For an organization transacting mechanical breakdown insurance in this state prior to January 1, 1987 and having in force seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) or more of gross written premiums, membership fees or similar charges in this state, an amount equal to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00).</p>
                <p>(b) An organization may instead of depositing securities required under subsection (a) of this section and subject to the approval of the commissioner, file with the commissioner a surety bond issued by an authorized surety insurer under this code. The bond shall be for that purpose stated under subsection (a) of this section and the commissioner shall not approve any bond if the protection against insolvency is not equal to the protection afforded by those securities under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(c) An organization may instead of any deposit of securities or filing of surety bonds required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section and subject to approval of the commissioner, file a paid contractual liability insurance policy with the commissioner. This policy shall be issued by an insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state and shall be in an amount equal to or greater than fifty percent (50%) of gross written premiums in this state. The commissioner shall not approve any contractual liability insurance policy if the protection against insolvency is not equal to the protection afforded by those securities under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) Securities, bonds or insurance policies posted or filed pursuant to this section shall in case of insolvency or impairment of any organization, be for the benefit of and subject to action by any person sustaining any injury due to the failure of the organization to faithfully perform its obligations to its insureds.</p>
                <p>(e) The state is responsible for the safekeeping of all securities deposited with the commissioner under this chapter. The securities are not subject to taxation but shall be held exclusively to guarantee the performance of the obligations of the organization to its insureds.</p>
                <p>(f) The deposit, bond or insurance shall be maintained unimpaired as long as the mechanical breakdown insurance organization continues to operate in this state. If the organization ceases to do business in this state and furnishes proof satisfactory to the commissioner that it has discharged or otherwise adequately provided for all its obligations to its insureds in this state, the state shall release the deposited securities to the entitled parties on presentation of the state treasurer's receipts for those securities or shall release any filed bond or insurance policy.</p>
                <p>(g) At any time the commissioner may enter an order increasing the amount of the deposit, bond or insurance specified under subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section if he finds there has been a substantial change in the facts including an increase in the amount of premiums, membership fees or similar charges in force in this state on which the original determination was based. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice, the organization may submit a request to the commissioner for a hearing on the order for modification. The commissioner shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the request. Failure to meet the modified requirements within thirty (30) days after a final decision or after expiration of the thirty (30) day period for submitting a request for hearing is grounds for rehabilitation pursuant to chapter 28 of this code.</p>

In the examination, the assets of any organization are those assets determined by the commissioner to be available for the payment of the obligations of the organization.

The term includes group and individual annuities and life insurance policies or riders which provide directly or which supplement long-term care insurance. The term also includes a policy or rider which provides for payment of benefits based upon cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity. The term shall also include qualified long-term care contracts.</p>
                  <p>Long-term care insurance may be issued by insurers, fraternal benefit societies, nonprofit health, hospital and medical service corporations, prepaid health plans, health maintenance organizations or any similar organization to the extent the entity is otherwise authorized to issue life or health insurance. Long-term care insurance shall not include any insurance policy which is offered primarily to provide basic Medicare supplement coverage, basic hospital expense coverage, basic medical-surgical expense coverage, hospital confinement indemnity coverage, major medical expense coverage, disability income or related asset protection coverage, accident only coverage, specified disease or specified accident coverage or limited benefit health coverage. With regard to life insurance, the term "long-term care insurance" does not include life insurance policies which accelerate the death benefit specifically for one (1) or more of the qualifying events of terminal illness, medical conditions requiring extraordinary medical intervention, or permanent institutional confinement, and which provide the option of a lump-sum payment for those benefits and in which neither the benefits nor the eligibility for the benefits is conditioned upon the receipt of long-term care. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this article, other than W.S. 26-38-109(e), any product advertised, marketed or offered as long-term care insurance shall be subject to the provisions of this article;</p>
                  <p>(vi) "Policy" means any policy, contract, subscriber agreement, certificate, rider or endorsement delivered or issued for delivery in this state by an insurer, fraternal benefit society, nonprofit health, hospital or medical service corporation, prepaid health plan, health maintenance organization or any similar organization;</p>

                  <p>(viii) "Qualified long-term care insurance contract" means any life insurance contract which provides long-term care coverage by rider or as part of the contract so long as it is in compliance with the applicable provisions of section 7702B of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. The term also means any other individual or group insurance contract if it meets the requirements of section 7702(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and if:</p>
                  <p>(A) The only insurance protection provided under the contract is coverage of qualified long-term care services;</p>
                  <p>(B) The contract does not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items to the extent that such expenses are reimbursable under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, as amended, or would be so reimbursable but for the application of a deductible or coinsurance amount. The requirements of this subparagraph do not apply to contracts in which Medicare is a secondary payor, or if the contract makes per diem or other periodic payments without regard to expenses;</p>
                  <p>(C) The contract is guaranteed renewable;</p>
                  <p>(D) The contract does not provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged as collateral for a loan or borrowed. All refunds of premiums, and all policyholder dividends or similar amounts, under such contract are to be applied as a reduction in future premiums or to increase future benefits, except that a refund of the aggregate premium paid under the contract may be allowed in the event of death of the insured or a complete surrender or cancellation of the contract; and</p>
                  <p>(E) The contract contains the consumer protection provisions set forth in section 7702B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                  <p>(ix) "Qualified long-term care services" means necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, and rehabilitative services, and maintenance for personal care services to which an insured is eligible for under a qualified long-term care insurance contract, and which are provided pursuant to a plan of care prescribed by a licensed health care practitioner.</p>

                  <p>No group long-term care insurance coverage may be offered to a resident of this state under a group policy issued in another state to a group described in W.S. 26-38-103(a)(iv)(D), unless this state or another state having statutory and regulatory long-term care insurance requirements substantially similar to those adopted in this state has made a determination that those requirements have been met.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-38-105. Disclosure and performance standards for long- term care insurance.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The commissioner shall adopt regulations that include standards for full and fair disclosure setting forth the manner, content and required disclosures for the sale of long-term care insurance policies, terms of renewability, initial and subsequent conditions of eligibility, nonduplication of coverage provisions, coverage of dependents, preexisting conditions, termination of insurance, probationary periods, limitations, exceptions, reductions, elimination periods, requirements for replacement, recurrent conditions and definitions of terms.</p>
                  <p>(b) No long-term care insurance policy shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Be cancelled, nonrenewed or otherwise terminated on the grounds of the age or the deterioration of the mental or physical health of the insured individual or certificate holder;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Contain a provision establishing a new waiting period in the event existing coverage is converted to or replaced by a new or other form within the same company, except with respect to an increase in benefits voluntarily selected by the insured individual or group policyholder; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Contain coverage for skilled nursing care only or contain coverage that provides significantly more skilled care in a facility than coverage for lower levels of care.</p>
                  <p>(c) No long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall use a definition of "preexisting condition" which is more restrictive than the definition provided in this article.</p>
                  <p>(d) No long-term care insurance policy shall exclude coverage for a loss or confinement which is the result of a preexisting condition unless the loss or confinement begins within six (6) months following the effective date of coverage of an insured person.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commissioner may extend the limitation periods set forth in subsections (c) and (d) of this section as to specific age group categories in specific policy forms upon finding that the extension is in the best interest of the public.</p>
                  <p>(f) The definition of "preexisting condition" does not prohibit an insurer from using an application form designed to elicit the complete health history of an applicant, and, on the basis of the answers on that application, from underwriting in accordance with that insurer's established underwriting standards. Unless otherwise provided in the policy, a preexisting condition, regardless of whether it is disclosed in the application, need not be covered until the waiting period described in subsection (d) of this section expires. No long-term care insurance policy may exclude or use waivers or riders of any kind to exclude, limit, or reduce coverage or benefits for specifically named or described preexisting diseases or physical conditions beyond the waiting period described in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) No long-term care insurance policy may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state if the policy:</p>
                  <p>(i) Conditions eligibility for any benefits on a prior hospitalization requirement;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Conditions eligibility for benefits provided in an institutional care setting on the receipt of a higher level of institutional care;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Conditions eligibility for any benefits, other than waiver of premium, post-confinement, post-acute care or recuperative benefits, on a prior institutionalization requirement; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Fails to meet any of the following requirements:</p>
                  <p>(A) A long-term care insurance policy containing post-confinement, post-acute care or recuperative benefits shall clearly label in a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate entitled "limitations or conditions on eligibility for benefits" the limitations or conditions, including any required number of days of confinement;</p>
                  <p>(B) A long-term care insurance policy or rider which conditions eligibility of noninstitutional benefits on the prior receipt of institutional care shall not require a prior institutional stay of more than five (5) days;</p>
                  <p>(C) No long-term care insurance policy or rider which provides benefits only following institutionalization shall condition the benefits upon admission to a facility for the same or related conditions within a period of less than thirty (30) days after discharge from the institution.</p>
                  <p>(h) The commissioner shall adopt regulations establishing loss ratio standards for long-term care insurance policies provided that a specific reference to long-term care insurance policies is contained in the regulation.</p>
                  <p>(j) Long-term care insurance policyholders or certificate holders, shall have the right to return the policy or certificate within thirty (30) days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, the policyholder or certificate holder is not satisfied for any reason. Long-term care insurance policies and certificates shall have a notice prominently printed on the first page of the policy and certificate or attached thereto stating in substance that the policyholder or certificate holder shall have the right to return the policy within thirty (30) days of its delivery and to have the premium refunded if, after examination of the policy or certificate, other than a certificate issued pursuant to a policy issued to a group defined in W.S. 26-38-103(a)(iv)(A), the policyholder or certificate holder is not satisfied for any reason. The premium shall be refunded within ten (10) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, from the date the policy or certificate is returned. If the premium required to be refunded under this subsection is not refunded within the time periods specified it shall draw interest at the maximum rate allowed for a credit service charge under W.S. 40-14-212(b). No company issuing a long-term care insurance policy shall be required to pay any claim under the terms of the policy until the expiration of the thirty (30) day period. If an application for a qualified long-term care contract is denied, the issuer shall refund to the applicant any premium refund within thirty (30) days of the denial.</p>
                  <p>(k) An outline of coverage shall be delivered to a prospective applicant at the time of the initial solicitation through means which prominently direct the attention of the recipient to the document and its purpose. The commissioner shall prescribe a standard format of the outline of coverage, including style, arrangement, overall appearance and content. In the case of agent solicitations, an agent shall deliver the outline of coverage prior to the presentation of an application or enrollment form. In the case of direct response solicitations, the outline of coverage shall be presented in conjunction with any application or enrollment form. In the case of a group policy, the outline shall be delivered to certificate holders when the certificate is delivered. The outline of coverage shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A description of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A statement of the principal exclusions, reductions and limitations contained in the policy;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A statement of the terms under which the policy or certificate, or both, may be continued in force or discontinued, including any reservation in the policy of a right to change premium. Continuation or conversion provisions of group coverage shall be specifically described;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A statement that the outline of coverage is a summary only, not a contract of insurance, and that the policy or group master policy contains governing contractual provisions;</p>
                  <p>(v) A description of the terms under which the policy or certificate may be returned and premium refunded;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A brief description of the relationship of cost of care and benefits; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) If the policy or certificate is intended to be a qualified long-term care insurance contract, a statement that discloses to the policyholder or certificate holder that the policy is intended to be a qualified long-term care insurance contract.</p>

                  <p>(n) Repealed by Laws 1993, ch. 212, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(o) The issuer of a long-term care insurance contract shall deliver to the applicant, policyholder or certificate holder, the contract or certificate of insurance no later than thirty (30) days after the date of approval. At the time of policy delivery, a policy summary shall be delivered for an individual life insurance policy which provides long-term care benefits within the policy or rider. In the case of direct response solicitations, the insurer shall deliver the policy summary upon the applicant's request, but regardless of request shall make the delivery no later than at the time of policy delivery. In addition to complying with all applicable requirements, the summary shall also include:</p>
                  <p>(i) An explanation of how the long-term care benefit interacts with other components of the policy, including deductions from death benefits;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An illustration of the amount of benefits, the length of benefits, and guaranteed lifetime benefits if any, for each covered person;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any exclusions, reductions and limitations on benefits of long-term care; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) If applicable to the policy type, the summary shall also include:</p>
                  <p>(A) A disclosure of the effects of exercising other rights under the policy;</p>
                  <p>(B) A disclosure of guarantees related to long-term care costs of insurance charges; and</p>
                  <p>(C) Current and projected maximum lifetime benefits.</p>
                  <p>(p) If any long-term care benefit, funded through a life insurance vehicle by the acceleration of the death benefit, is in benefit payment status, a monthly report shall be provided to the policyholder. The report shall include:</p>

                  <p>(ii) An explanation of any changes in the policy, including, but not limited to, death benefits or cash values, due to long-term care benefits; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The amount of long-term care benefits existing or remaining.</p>
                  <p>(q) If a claim under a long-term care insurance contract is denied, the issuer shall, within sixty (60) days of the date of a written request by the policyholder, or certificate holder or an authorized representative:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide a written explanation of the reason for the denial; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Make available all information directly related to the denial.</p>
                  <p>(r) Long-term care insurance premium rate increases shall be based on accepted actuarial principles and practices. All long-term care insurance premium rate increases shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner.</p>

                  <p>(a) For a long-term care insurance policy or certificate that has been in force for less than six (6) months, an insurer may rescind the policy or certificate or deny any otherwise valid long-term care insurance claim upon a showing of misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance of coverage.</p>
                  <p>(b) For a long-term care insurance policy or certificate that has been in force for at least six (6) months but less than two (2) years, an insurer may rescind the policy or certificate or deny an otherwise valid long-term care insurance claim upon a showing of misrepresentation that is both material to the acceptance for coverage and which pertains to the conditions for which benefits are sought.</p>
                  <p>(c) After a long-term care insurance policy or certificate has been in force for two (2) years it is not contestable upon the grounds of misrepresentation, unless the insured knowingly and intentionally misrepresented relevant facts relating to the insured's health.</p>
                  <p>(d) No long-term care insurance policy or certificate may be field issued based on medical or health status.

                  <p>(a) Each insurer offering long-term care insurance shall, as a protection against unintentional lapse, comply with the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) No individual long-term care policy or certificate shall be issued until the insurer has received from the applicant either a written designation of at least one (1) person, in addition to the applicant, who is to receive notice of lapse or termination of the policy or certificate for nonpayment of premium, or a written waiver dated and signed by the applicant electing not to designate additional persons to receive notice. The applicant has the right to designate at least one (1) person who is to receive the notice of termination, in addition to the insured. A designation shall not constitute acceptance of any liability by the third party for services provided to the insured. The form used for the written designation shall provide space clearly designated for listing at least one (1) person. The designation shall include each person's full name and home address. In the case of an applicant who elects not to designate an additional person, the waiver shall state: "Protection against unintended lapse." "I understand that I have the right to designate at least one (1) person other than myself to receive notice of lapse or termination of this long-term care insurance policy for nonpayment of premium. I understand that notice will not be given until thirty (30) days after a premium is due and unpaid. I elect not to designate any person to receive such notice."</p>
                  <p>The insurer shall notify the insured of the right to change the written designation, no less than once every two (2) years;</p>
                  <p>(ii) When the policyholder or certificate holder pays premium for a long-term care insurance policy or certificate through a payroll or pension deduction plan, the requirements contained in paragraph (a)(i) of this section need not be met until sixty (60) days after the policyholder or certificate holder is no longer enrolled in the payment plan. The application or enrollment form for such policies or certificates shall clearly indicate the payment plan selected by the applicant;</p>
                  <p>(iii) No long-term care policy or certificate shall lapse or be terminated for nonpayment of premium unless the insurer, at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the lapse or termination, has given notice to the insured and to those persons designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this section, at the address provided by the insured, to receive notice of lapse or termination. Notice shall be given by first class United States mail, postage prepaid. Notice shall not be given until thirty (30) days after a premium is due and unpaid.

                  <p>(a) Subject to subsection (g) of this section, an insurer that offers a long-term care insurance policy or certificate in this state shall offer a nonforfeiture protection provision as an option. The nonforfeiture benefit shall be made available in the event of a default in the payment of any premiums, or upon the surrender of the policy or certificate by the policyholder or certificate holder.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to subsection (g) of this section, the nonforfeiture provision offered for a policy which is not intended to be a qualified long-term insurance contract, shall be appropriately captioned and shall provide at least one (1) of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Reduced paid-up insurance;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Extended term insurance;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Cash surrender values;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A return of premium;</p>
                  <p>(v) A shortened benefit period; or</p>
                  <p>(vi) Other offerings as approved by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nonforfeiture benefits shall be computed in an actuarially sound manner, using a methodology that has been filed with and approved by the commissioner. At the time of lapse, or upon request by the policyholder or certificate holder, the insurer shall disclose the then-accrued nonforfeiture values. At the time the policy or certificate is issued, the insurer shall provide to the policyholder or certificate holder schedules demonstrating estimated values of nonforfeiture benefits. The schedules shall state that the estimated values are not to be construed as guaranteed nonforfeiture values.</p>
                  <p>(d) The amount of nonforfeiture benefits shall be adjusted subsequent to being initially granted only as necessary to reflect changes in claims, persistency and interest as reflected in changes in rates for premium paying policies approved by the commissioner for the same policy form.</p>
                  <p>(e) This section does not apply to life insurance policies or riders containing accelerated long-term care benefits.</p>
                  <p>(f) Nonforfeiture benefits for qualified long-term care insurance contracts shall include at least a reduced paid-up insurance benefit, an extended term insurance benefit, the offer of a shortened benefit period, or other similar offerings approved by the secretary of the treasury, and shall be provided as specified in regulations. The issuer of such a contract may refund premiums upon complete surrender or cancellation of the contract or policy, as long as the refund does not exceed the aggregate premiums paid for the contract or policy.</p>
                  <p>(g) Within fifteen (15) business days following receipt of written proof of the death of an insured, an insurer under this chapter shall refund unearned premiums paid for any period beyond the death of the insured. The amount of the refund shall be pro rata from the date of death.</p>

                  <p>(b) The commissioner shall adopt reasonable regulations to establish specific standards for policy provisions of Medicare supplement policies and certificates. The standards shall be in addition to and in accordance with applicable laws of this state. No requirement of the code relating to minimum required policy benefits, other than the minimum standards contained in this act, shall apply to Medicare supplement policies and certificates. The standards may cover, but are not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Terms of renewability;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Initial and subsequent conditions of eligibility;</p>

                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract, a Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not exclude or limit benefits for losses incurred more than ninety (90) days from the effective date of coverage because the loss involved a preexisting condition.

                  <p>(i) "Health care provider" means any physician, hospital or other person licensed or otherwise authorized in this or another state to furnish to any individual medical or dental care, vision care or hospitalization incident to the furnishing of that care or hospitalization for the purpose of preventing, alleviating, curing or healing human illness, injury or physical disability;</p>

                  <p>(iii) "Medical necessity," means:</p>
                  <p>(A) A medical service, procedure or supply provided for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or symptom and is a service, procedure or supply that:</p>
                  <p>(I) Is medically appropriate for the symptoms, diagnosis or treatment of the condition, illness, disease or injury;</p>
                  <p>(II) Provides for the diagnosis, direct care and treatment of the patient's condition, illness, disease or injury;</p>

                  <p>(IV) Is not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician or other health care provider.</p>
                  <p>(B) A medical service, procedure or supply shall not be excluded from being a medical necessity under this section solely because the service, procedure or supply is not in common use if the safety and effectiveness of the service, procedure or supply is supported by:</p>
                  <p>(I) Peer reviewed medical literature, including literature relating to therapies reviewed and approved by a qualified institutional review board, biomedical compendia and other medical literature that meet the criteria of the National Institutes of Health's Library of Medicine for indexing in Index Medicus (Medline) and Elsevier Science Ltd. for indexing in Excerpta Medicus (EMBASE); or</p>

                  <p>(a) If any disability insurance policy provides for settlement of a claim for payment of medical services or procedures provided by a health care provider using a usual, customary and reasonable basis the insurer shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Submit to the department upon request statistical data of health care provider's charges on which the insurer bases payment of claims. Such data shall be submitted upon request of the commissioner, provided, however, no insurer may be required to submit data more than once every six (6) months. The data submitted shall contain only charges for services performed not more than one (1) year prior to the date of the most recent data;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide to the claimant, in writing, a complete explanation of the basis of settlement, if requested by the claimant in writing, and maintain the explanation in the claim file. If the basis of payment is less than the actual charge made by the health care provider, the explanation shall state the specific reason for the amount not paid and may not expressly state that the health care provider is overcharging unless the allegation is substantiated by fact set out in the explanation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Settle any claim for medical services or procedures only on the basis of charges made by Wyoming health care providers of similar qualifications or experience for the same or similar medical services or procedures if the service or procedure for which payment is sought was obtained in Wyoming. However, if the profile or survey does not contain a statistically credible sample of charges, the insurer may include in the profile or survey charges from another similar geographic and demographic area so that a reliable basis is established.</p>
                  <p>(b) Statistical data submitted to the department pursuant to this section shall be confidential in nature and not available for public inspection.</p>
                  <p>(c) When a disability insurance policy provides for settlement of a claim for payment of medical services or procedures provided by a health care provider using a usual, customary and reasonable basis or any similar basis:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the commissioner, based either on a review of the statistical data submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or on the receipt of complaints from one (1) or more insureds, has reason to suspect that a claim or one (1) or more classes of claims is not being settled on the basis provided by the policy he may order the company to show cause why the settlement or settlements should not be changed;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the commissioner finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company is not settling a claim or one (1) or more classes of claims on the basis provided by the policy, he may order a different settlement or settlements.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this section, "medical necessity or other similar basis" includes, but is not limited to, "medically necessary," "medically necessary care" and "medically necessary and appropriate," as defined in W.S. 26-40-102(a)(iii).</p>
                  <p>(b) If any insurance policy provides for settlement of a claim for payment of medical services, procedures or supplies provided by a health care provider using a medical necessity or other similar basis the insurer shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Define medical necessity or other similar basis as "medical necessity" is defined in this chapter and W.S. 26-40-102(a)(iii);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Make all determinations whether a medical service, procedure or supply is medically necessary based only upon the factors stated in the definition of medical necessity contained in W.S. 26-40-102(a)(iii);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide internal review and external review procedures for all denied claims as required in this section and disclose all procedures, time lines and requirements for such review procedures in every insurance policy and as otherwise required in this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) When any claim for the provision of or payment for medical services, procedures or supplies is first denied as not being a medical necessity, or on another similar basis, the insurer shall provide to the claimant, in writing, a complete explanation of the basis for the settlement and shall specify why the services, procedures or supplies requested are not medically necessary. Such explanation shall also include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A statement in the following, or substantially equivalent, language: "We have denied your request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or course of treatment. You have the right to have our decision reviewed by following the procedures outlined in this notice. You also may have the right to an expedited review under circumstances where a delayed review would adversely affect you."; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) A statement describing a procedure for having the claim denial reviewed by the insurer, including all applicable time limits, requirements and a process for having a expedited review initiated as expeditiously as the claimant's medical condition or circumstances require, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours, where:</p>
                  <p>(A) The timeframe for the completion of a normal review would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the claimant or would jeopardize the claimant's ability to regain maximum function; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The claimant's claim concerns a request for an admission, availability of care, continued stay or health care service for which the claimant received emergency services, but has not been discharged from a health care facility.</p>
                  <p>(d) A claimant shall have not less than thirty (30) days in which to file a request for the review provided in subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section and such review shall be completed by the insurer, and a decision delivered to the claimant, no later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of a request for review.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a claim for the provision of or payment for medical services, procedures or supplies is denied on the basis that it is not a medical necessity, or on other similar basis, after having been reviewed by the insurer pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this section, the insurer shall provide to the claimant, in writing, a complete explanation of the basis for the decision and shall specify why the services, procedures or supplies requested are not medically necessary. Such explanation shall also include:</p>
                  <p>(i) The signed opinion of at least one (1) credited medical consultant who agrees with the denial and who is not an employee of the insurer if requested by the claimant;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A statement in the following, or substantially equivalent, language: "We have denied your request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or course of treatment. You may have the right to have our decision reviewed by health care professionals who have no association with us and is not the attending physician or the physician's partner by following the procedures outlined in this notice. You also may have the right to an expedited review under circumstances where a delayed review would adversely affect you."; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) A statement describing the procedure for having the denied claim reviewed by an external review organization pursuant to regulations adopted by the commissioner. The statement shall include a description of all procedures, time limits and requirements, including those related to expedited reviews, which the claimant must follow to obtain an external review and include a request for external review form and release of records form approved by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(f) Within one hundred twenty (120) days of receiving the written explanation required by subsection (e) of this section, a claimant may request an external review of the decision which is the subject of the explanation by filing a written request for such review. The request shall be submitted to the insurer on a form approved by the commissioner, unless such form was not provided to the claimant as required by subsection (e) of this section, in which event any written request for an external review shall be sufficient.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon receiving a request for external review, the insurer shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Immediately send a copy of the request to the commissioner;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Assign the request to an independent review organization that has been approved by the commissioner for a preliminary review. The insurer shall provide to the independent review organization all documents and information upon which the insurer relied in denying all claims under review. Failure to provide the documents and other information shall not delay the conduct of the external review. The independent review organization shall determine whether:</p>
                  <p>(A) The claimant is or was a covered person in the insurance policy at the time the provision of or payment for medical services, procedures or supplies was requested or provided;</p>
                  <p>(B) The provision of or payment for medical services, procedures or supplies requested by the claimant reasonably appears to be a covered service under the insurance policy, but for the determination by the insurer that the services, procedures or supplies are not a medical necessity;</p>
                  <p>(C) The insurer has denied the claimant's request for the provision of or payment for medical services, procedures or supplies after having been given the opportunity to review the insurer's first denial one (1) or more times;</p>
                  <p>(D) The claimant has provided to the insurer all the information and forms required to process an external review, including a release form, approved by the commissioner, by which the claimant authorizes the release of protected health information pertinent to the external review.</p>
                  <p>(h) The independent review organization shall within five (5) days determine whether the documentation is complete and immediately notify the claimant and the insurer in writing whether the documentation is complete and, if not, what information or documentation is missing. The claimant may submit in writing to the independent review organization any additional supporting documentation that the independent review organization should consider or may require when conducting its external review. If the request for review is not complete, the independent review organization shall require from the insurer or the claimant the information or materials needed to make the request complete.</p>
                  <p>(j) The independent review organization shall, within one (1) business day of its receipt, forward all documentation and information it receives from an insurer or claimant to the opposing insurer or claimant. The insurer may use any documentation or other information provided by the claimant to reconsider its settlement of the claims. If the insurer chooses to reverse its prior decision, it shall immediately provide written notice to the claimant, the independent review organization and the commissioner, at which time the review shall be terminated.</p>
                  <p>(k) In addition to the documents and information provided pursuant to this section, the independent review organization, to the extent the information is available and the independent review organization considers them appropriate, shall consider the following in reaching its decision:</p>
                  <p>(i) The claimant's medical records;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The attending health care professional's recommendation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Consulting reports from appropriate health care professionals and other documents submitted by the insurer, claimant or the claimant's treating provider;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The terms of coverage under the claimant's insurance policy;</p>
                  <p>(v) The standards identified in W.S. 26-40-102(a)(iii);</p>
                  <p>(vi) All evidence based research used in the insurer's denial of the claim.</p>
                  <p>(m) Within forty-five (45) days after the date of receipt of the request for external review, the assigned independent review organization shall provide written notice to the claimant, the insurer and the commissioner of its decision to uphold or reverse the decision of the insurer that the provision of or payment for medical services, procedures or supplies requested by the claimant are not medically necessary. Such written notice shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A general description of the reason for the request for external review;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The date the independent review organization received the assignment from the insurer to conduct the review;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The date the external review was conducted;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The date of its decision;</p>
                  <p>(v) The principal reasons for its decision;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The rationale for its decision; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) References to the evidence or documentation considered in reaching its decision.</p>
                  <p>(n) In the event the external review organization determines the claims should be allowed, the insurer shall approve the request for the provision of or payment for medical services, procedures or supplies that was the subject of the review and notify the claimant of such approval within five (5) days.</p>
                  <p>(o) The engagement by an insurer of an independent review organization to conduct an external review in accordance with this section shall be fair and impartial. The insurer, insured and the independent review organization shall comply with regulations promulgated by the commissioner to ensure fairness and impartiality in the engagement of approved independent review organizations, in the terms, termination and payment of independent review organizations and in the review process.</p>
                  <p>(p) The commissioner shall adopt regulations establishing an expedited review by an external review organization as expeditiously as the claimant's medical condition or circumstances require, but in no event more than seventy-two (72) hours after the date of receipt of the request for an expedited external review, and which allows an expedited external review where:</p>
                  <p>(i) The timeframe for the completion of a normal external review would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the claimant or would jeopardize the claimant's ability to regain maximum function; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The claimant's claim concerns a request for an admission, availability of care, continued stay or health care service for which the claimant received emergency services, but has not been discharged from a health care facility.</p>
                  <p>(q) The insurer against whom a request for external review is filed shall pay the costs of the independent review organization's external review.</p>
                  <p>(r) The commissioner shall adopt such regulations as are necessary to promote the purposes of this section, which regulations shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) Fees, including the waiver of fees for indigent persons;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Standards and procedures for the approval of independent review organizations;</p>
                  <p>(iii) External review organization reporting and record retention requirements.</p>
                  <p>(s) An insurer required to comply with the notification and appeal procedures of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and being compliant therewith, shall be deemed in compliance with this section.</p>

                <p>Any insurer which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than this state and is admitted to do business in this state for the purpose of writing insurance may become a domestic insurer by meeting the substantive requirements of law relative to the organization and licensing of a domestic insurer of the same type, by designating its principal place of business at a place in this state, and by receiving from the commissioner certification that it is a domestic insurer as if originally formed in the state. The domesticated insurer thereafter will be entitled to domestic certificates and licenses to transact business in this state, and shall be subject to the authority and jurisdiction of this state as a domestic insurer.</p>

                <p>(a) The certificate of authority, agent appointments and licenses, rates, and other items which the commissioner of insurance allows, in his discretion, which are in existence at the time any insurer licensed to transact the business of insurance in this state transfers its corporate domicile to this or any other state by merger, consolidation, continuance, transfer or any other lawful method shall continue in full force and effect upon the transfer if the insurer remains duly qualified to transact the business of insurance in this state. All outstanding policies of any transferring insurer shall remain in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the new name of the company or its new location unless so ordered by the commissioner. Every transferring insurer shall file new policy forms with the commissioner on or before the effective date of the transfer, but may use existing policy forms with appropriate endorsements if allowed by, and under conditions approved by, the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(b) The procedures for filing and approval of articles of domestication by the corporate directors shall be the same as those set forth in W.S. 26-24-104 concerning the filing and approval of articles of incorporation for proposed domestic insurers.</p>
                <p>(c) The articles of domestication of any insurer transferring its domicile into this state shall be deemed the articles of incorporation of the insurer. The domestication of an insurer into this state shall have the same effect upon the insurer as in the case of a corporation continuing in Wyoming pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1810.</p>

                <p>(a) This act shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subsection (b) of this section and provide coverage as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) To persons who are owners, certificate holders or enrollees under the policies or contracts other than structured settlement annuities and in each case who:</p>
                <p>(A) Are residents; or</p>
                <p>(B) Are not residents but only under all of the following conditions:</p>
                <p>(I) The member insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in this state;</p>
                <p>(II) The states in which the persons reside have associations similar to the association created by this act; and</p>
                <p>(III) The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact that the insurer or health maintenance organization was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the state's guaranty association law.</p>
                <p>(ii) To persons who are the beneficiaries, assignees or payees of the persons described in paragraph (a)(i) of this section, including health care providers rendering services covered under health insurance policies or certificates, regardless of where they reside except for nonresident certificate holders under group policies or contracts;</p>
                <p>(iii) For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection (b) of this section, paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection shall not apply, and this act shall, except as provided in paragraphs (iv) and (v) of this subsection, provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased, if the payee:</p>
                <p>(A) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides; or</p>
                <p>(B) Is not a resident, but only under both of the following conditions:</p>
                <p>(I) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident, or the contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is not a resident, but the insurer that issued the structured settlement annuity is domiciled in this state and the state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the association created by this act; and</p>
                <p>(II) Neither the payee or beneficiary of the contract owner nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract owner resides.</p>

                <p>(v) This act is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident.

In determining the application of the provisions of this paragraph in situations where a person could be covered by the association of more than one (1) state, whether as an owner, payee, enrollee, beneficiary or assignee, this act shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one (1) association.</p>

                <p>(A) Averaged over the period of four (4) years prior to the date on which the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under this act, exceeds a rate of interest determined by subtracting two (2) percentage points from Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average averaged for that same four (4) year period or for a lesser period if the policy or contract was issued less than four (4) years before the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under this act; and</p>
                <p>(B) On and after the date on which the member insurer becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer under this act, exceeds the rate of interest determined by subtracting three (3) percentage points from the most recent and available Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average.</p>

The association may require an assignment to it of the rights and cause of action by any enrollee, payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this act upon the person. The subrogation rights of the association under this subsection shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this act. In addition, the association shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, enrollee or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contracts and shall include, in the case of a structured settlement annuity, any rights of the owner, beneficiary or payee of the annuity, to the extent of benefits received pursuant to this act, against a person originally or by succession responsible for the losses arising from the personal injury relating to the annuity or payment therefor, excluding any person responsible solely by reason of serving as an assignee in respect to a qualified assignment under section 130 of the Internal Revenue Code. If the provisions of this subsection are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies or portion thereof covered by the association. If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights as described in this subsection, the person shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies or portion thereof covered by the association.</p>
                <p>(r) The association may:</p>
                <p>(i) Enter into contracts as necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this act;</p>
                <p>(ii) Sue or be sued including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under W.S. 26-42-107 and to settle claims or potential claims against it;</p>

                <p>(ix) Unless prohibited by law, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy or contract, file for actuarially justified rate or premium increases for any policy or contract for which it provides coverage under this act;</p>
                <p>(x) Take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations under this act or to exercise its powers under this act.</p>
                <p>(s) The association may join an organization of one (1) or more other state associations of similar purposes to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association.</p>
                <p>(t) With respect to covered policies or contracts for which the association becomes obligated after an entry of an order of liquidation or rehabilitation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights of the insolvent insurer arising after the date of the order of liquidation or rehabilitation under any contract of reinsurance to which the insolvent insurer was a party, to the extent that the contract provides coverage for losses occurring after the date of the order of liquidation or rehabilitation. As a condition to making this election, the association shall pay all unpaid premiums due under the contract for coverage relating to periods before and after the date of the order of liquidation or rehabilitation.</p>
                <p>(u) The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this act in an economical and efficient manner.</p>
                <p>(w) Where the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this act to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under this act, the person shall not be entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement.</p>

                <p>(i) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for a fixed interest rate, payment of dividends with minimum guarantees or a different method for calculating interest or changes in value;</p>
                <p>(ii) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms.</p>

                <p>(c) The amount of any Class A assessment shall be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and those assessments may be authorized and called on a non pro rata basis. The amount of any Class B assessment shall be allocated for assessment purposes among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as fair and reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
                <p>(d) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer or policies or contracts covered by each account for the three (3) most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became insolvent, or in the case of an assessment with respect to an impaired insurer, the three (3) most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became impaired, bears to the premiums received on business in this state for the calendar years by all assessed member insurers.</p>
                <p>The amount of the Class B assessment for long term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the commissioner. The methodology shall provide for fifty percent (50%) of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and fifty percent (50%) to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.</p>
                <p>(e) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be made until necessary to implement the purposes of this act. Classification of assessments under subsection (b) of this section and computation of assessments under subsections</p>
                <p>(c) and (d) of this section shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro-rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty (180) days after the assessment is authorized.</p>
                <p>(f) The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.</p>
                <p>In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association.</p>
                <p>(g) The total of all assessments imposed upon a member insurer for each account are subject to the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Subject to paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each account shall not in any one (1) calendar year exceed two percent (2%) of the insurer's average premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the account during the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer;</p>
                <p>(ii) If two (2) or more assessments are authorized in one (1) calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in paragraph (i) of this subsection shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three (3) year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated pursuant to this subsection;</p>
                <p>(iii) If the maximum assessment including the other assets of the association in any account does not provide in any one (1) year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this act;</p>
                <p>(iv) The board may provide in the plan of operation provided by W.S. 26-42-108 a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one (1) or more impaired or insolvent insurers when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims.</p>
                <p>(h) The board may refund to member insurers the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to the account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains and income from investments. The board shall use an equitable method to make the refunds and the refunds shall be in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to the account. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses.</p>
                <p>(j) Any member insurer may, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance or health maintenance organization business within the scope of this act, consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this act.</p>
                <p>(k) The association shall issue to each member insurer paying an assessment under this act, other than a Class A assessment, a certificate of contribution in a form prescribed by the commissioner for the amount of the assessment paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the member insurer in its financial statement as an asset in a form and for an amount, if any, and a period of time as approved by the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(m) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest. Within sixty (60) days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest. Within thirty (30) days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the commissioner. In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the commissioner for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association. If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association.</p>
                <p>(n) The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request.</p>

                <p>(a) In addition to the duties and powers enumerated in other provisions of this act, the commissioner shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the association with a statement of the premiums in this and any other appropriate state for each member insurer;</p>
                <p>(ii) When an impairment is declared and the amount of the impairment is determined, serve a demand upon the impaired insurer to eliminate the impairment within a reasonable time. Notice to the impaired insurer shall constitute notice to its shareholders, if any.

                <p>(a) To aid in the detection and prevention of member insurer insolvencies or impairments, the commissioner shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Notify the commissioners of all the other states, territories of the United States and the District of Columbia by mail within thirty (30) days of any of the following actions taken against a member insurer:</p>

                <p>(ii) Report to the board of directors when he has taken any actions provided by paragraph (i) of this subsection or has received a report from any other commissioner indicating that any action provided by paragraph (i) of this subsection has been taken in another state. The report to the board of directors shall contain all significant details of the action taken or the report received from another commissioner;</p>
                <p>(iii) Report to the board of directors when he has reasonable cause to believe from any completed or pending examination of any member company that the company may be an impaired or insolvent insurer;</p>
                <p>(iv) Furnish to the board of directors the national association of insurance commissioners insurance regulatory information system ratios and listings of companies not included in the ratios developed by the national association of insurance commissioners, and the board may use this information in carrying out its duties and responsibilities under this section.

                <p>(b) The commissioner may seek the advice and recommendations of the board of directors concerning any matter affecting his duties and responsibilities regarding the financial condition of member insurers and insurers or health maintenance organizations seeking admission to transact business in this state.</p>
                <p>(c) The board of directors may by majority vote make reports and recommendations to the commissioner upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member insurer or germane to the solvency of any insurers or health maintenance organizations seeking to do any business in this state. The reports and recommendations are confidential and shall not be considered public documents.</p>
                <p>(d) It is the duty of the board of directors by majority vote to notify the commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be an impaired or insolvent insurer.</p>
                <p>(e) The board of directors may by majority vote request that the commissioner order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be an impaired or insolvent insurer. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a request, the commissioner shall begin an examination. The examination may be conducted as a national association of insurance commissioners examination or may be conducted by persons designated by the commissioner. The cost of the examination shall be paid by the association and the examination report shall be treated the same as other examination reports. In no event shall the examination report be released to the board of directors prior to its release to the public, but this shall not preclude the commissioner from complying with subsection (a) of this section. The commissioner shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed. The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the commissioner but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public.</p>
                <p>(f) The board of directors may by majority vote make recommendations to the commissioner for the detection and prevention of member insurer insolvencies.</p>
                <p>(g) The board of directors shall at the conclusion of any insurer insolvency in which the association was obligated to pay covered claims prepare a report to the commissioner containing information it has in its possession bearing on the history and causes of the insolvency. The board shall cooperate with the boards of directors of guaranty associations in other states in preparing a report on the history and causes of insolvency of a particular insurer and may adopt by reference any report prepared by other associations.</p>

                <p>(a) A member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability to this state an assessment described in W.S. 26-42-107(k) to the extent of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the assessment for each of the ten (10) calendar years following the year in which the assessment was paid.

                <p><shortTitle>26-42-112. Assessment liability; records; assets; proceedings against impaired or insolvent insurer.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) This act shall not be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability.</p>
                <p>(b) Records shall be kept of all meetings in which the board of directors discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under W.S. 26-42-106. The records of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be disclosed prior to the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer except upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer or upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under W.S. 26-42-113.</p>
                <p>(c) For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this act, the association is deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies or contracts reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as assignee or subrogee pursuant to W.S. 26-42-106(q). Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies or contracts shall be used to continue all covered policies or contracts and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this act. As used in this subsection, "assets attributable to covered policies or contracts" means that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies or contracts bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies or contracts of insurance or health benefits plans written by the impaired or insolvent insurer.</p>
                <p>(d) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding the court may consider the contributions of the respective parties including the association, the shareholders, contract owners, certificate holders, enrollees and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In such a determination consideration shall be given to the welfare of the owners, contract owners, certificate holders and enrollees of the continuing or successor insurer. No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims and interest on the claims of the association for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under W.S. 26-42-106 with respect to the member insurer have been fully recovered by the association.</p>
                <p>(e) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a member insurer domiciled in this state is entered, the receiver appointed under the order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the member insurer from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions other than stock dividends paid by the member insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five (5) years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this section.</p>
                <p>(f) No distribution pursuant to subsection (e) of this section is recoverable if the member insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the member insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.</p>
                <p>(g) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions he received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were declared is liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two (2) or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions they are jointly and severally liable.</p>
                <p>(h) The maximum amount recoverable under subsections (e) through (g) of this section is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer.</p>
                <p>(j) If any person liable under subsection (g) of this section is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid are jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.</p>
                <p>(k) As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subsection (c) of this section, the association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this act. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty (120) days of a final determination of insolvency of a member insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets.</p>

                <p>(iii) State that the member insurer and its agents are prohibited by law from using the existence of the association for the purpose of sales, solicitation or inducement to purchase any form of insurance or health maintenance organization coverage;</p>
                <p>(iv) Emphasize that the policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder or enrollee should not rely on coverage under the association when selecting an insurer or health maintenance organization;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>26-43-105. Assessments; premium tax credit.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) After each calendar year, the administrator shall determine the pool net premiums which are premiums less administrative expense allowances, the pool administrative expenses and the pool incurred losses for the calendar year considering investment income and other appropriate gains and losses.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each insurer's assessment shall be determined by multiplying the total cost of pool operation by a fraction the numerator of which equals the insurer's premium and subscriber contract charges for health insurance written in the state during the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which equals the total of all premiums, subscriber contract charges written in the state and to the extent not preempted by federal law, one hundred ten percent (110%) of all claims paid by insurance arrangements in the state during the preceding calendar year. To the extent not preempted by federal law, each insurance arrangement's assessment shall be determined by multiplying the total cost of pool operation by a fraction the numerator of which equals one hundred ten percent (110%) of the benefits paid by the insurance arrangement on behalf of insureds in this state during the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which equals the total of all premiums, subscriber contract charges and one hundred ten percent (110%) of all benefits paid by insurance arrangements made on behalf of insureds in the state during the preceding calendar year. Health insurance premiums and benefits paid by an insurance arrangement that are less than an amount determined by the board to justify the cost of collection shall not be considered for purposes of determining assessments. To the extent not preempted by federal law, insurance arrangements shall report to the board on an annual basis on a form prescribed by the commissioner. Members shall file with the board annual reports and other reports deemed necessary by the board to determine each member's proportion of participation.</p>
                  <p>(c) On or before March 1 of each year, the board shall determine each member's proportion of participation in the pool for the calendar year based on annual statements and other reports deemed necessary by the board and filed by the member with the board. Any deficit incurred by the pool shall be recouped by assessments apportioned under subsection (b) of this section by the board among members. Notification of assessments shall be mailed by the board not later than March 1 of each year. Assessments are due and payable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the assessment notice.</p>
                  <p>(d) For the total amount of assessments due from all members in any one (1) calendar year pursuant to this section up to four million dollars ($4,000,000.00), eighty percent (80%) of each member's proportionate contribution to the first two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) and fifty percent (50%) of the next two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) shall be allowed as a credit against any premium tax owed by the member under this code in the year for which the assessment is payable. The board shall not make a total assessment against all members of more than six million dollars ($6,000,000.00) in any one (1) fiscal year. Assessments received shall be used to defray the total cost of level one (1) pool operations first. Assessment amounts not required to support level one (1) pool operations will be used to support level two (2) operations before any general fund appropriation is used. The general fund appropriation shall only be used to support level two (2) operations. The board shall ensure that all expenses directly attributable to level one (1) individuals are paid from premiums, assessments and any withdrawals from previous reserves.</p>
                  <p>(e) The board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other members in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The member receiving an abatement or deferment shall remain liable to the pool for the deficiency for four (4) years.</p>
                  <p>(f) If assessments exceed actual losses and administrative expenses of the pool, the excess shall be paid to the state treasurer, credited to the account and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce pool premiums. As used in this subsection, "future losses" includes reserves for incurred but unreported claims.</p>
                  <p>(g) The board may require initial and interim assessments as reasonable and necessary for the organizational, administrative and interim operating expenses and to pay claims in excess of premiums collected. Any initial or interim assessments shall be credited as offsets against any regular assessments due following the close of the calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(h) Assessments collected pursuant to this act shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited to the account.</p>

                  <p>(a) Pool coverage shall be offered to eligible persons subject to the termination and disenrollment provisions of W.S 26-43-103(e). The commissioner shall establish by rule and regulation the pool coverage, its schedule of benefits, exclusions and other limitations consistent with this act and taking into consideration the advice and recommendations of the board and the health benefits plan committee created pursuant to W.S. 26-2-132. The commissioner and the board annually shall review the pool coverage, its schedule of benefits, exclusions and limitations and make changes to reflect the levels of health insurance coverage provided in this state.</p>
                  <p>(b) In establishing the pool coverage, the commissioner shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Consider the levels of health insurance provided in the state, medical economic factors deemed appropriate and the advice and recommendations of the board;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Promulgate benefit levels, deductibles, coinsurance factors, exclusions and limitations determined to be generally reflective of and commensurate with health insurance plans marketed in the state and required by this act.

                  <p>(a) Separate schedules of premium rates based on plan coverage under the pool, age, sex and geographical location may apply for individual risks.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board shall determine the standard risk rate by calculating the average individual standard rate charged by the five (5) largest insurers offering coverages in the state comparable to each plan coverage under the pool. If five (5) insurers do not offer comparable coverage, the standard risk rate shall be established using reasonable actuarial techniques and shall reflect anticipated experience and expenses for the applicable coverage.</p>
                  <p>(c) Initial rates for pool coverage in the first year coverage is provided pursuant to this act shall not be less than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of rates established as applicable for individual standard risks. Subsequent rates may provide for the expected costs of claims including recovery of prior losses, expenses of operation, investment income of claim reserves, and any other costs factors subject to the limitations provided by this subsection. Beginning July 1, 2007, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, there shall be two (2) levels of eligibility. Level one (1) eligibility applies to persons with income equal to or greater than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty guideline. Level two (2) eligibility applies to persons with income below two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty guideline. Premium rates for level one (1) eligibility shall be set at one hundred fifty percent (150%) to two hundred five percent (205%) of rates applicable to individual standard risks. Premium rates for level two (2) eligibility shall be set at one hundred percent (100%) to one hundred forty percent (140%) of rates applicable to individual standard risks. All rates and rate schedules shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval. The rates shall be set as close as practical to the lower end of the range provided.</p>
                  <p>(d) Premiums collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited to the account.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-44-102. Subsidiaries of insurers.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Any domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one (1) or more persons, may organize or acquire one (1) or more subsidiaries provided the stock of the insurer's subsidiaries are valued in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 26-6-302. Subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and their authority to do so shall not be limited by reason of the fact that they are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.</p>
                <p>(b) In addition to investments in common stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted under all other sections of this chapter, a domestic insurer may also:</p>
                <p>(i) Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of ten percent (10%) of the insurer's assets or fifty percent (50%) of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after the investments, the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of the investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries and health maintenance organizations shall be excluded, and there shall be included:</p>
                <p>(A) Total net monies or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities; and</p>
                <p>(B) All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus, of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation.</p>
                <p>(ii) Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer, provided that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that the investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in paragraph (i) of this subsection or in W.S. 26-7-102 through 26-7-116 applicable to the insurer. For the purposes of this paragraph, "the total investment of the insurer" shall include:</p>
                <p>(A) Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and</p>
                <p>(B) The insurer's proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the ownership of the subsidiary.</p>
                <p>(iii) With the approval of the commissioner, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one (1) or more subsidiaries, provided that after the investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.</p>
                <p>(c) Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) of this section meets the applicable requirements is to be determined before the investment is made by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.</p>
                <p>(d) If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment in the subsidiary made pursuant to this section within three (3) years from the time of the cessation of control or within any further time the commissioner may prescribe, unless the investment meets the requirements for investment under any other section of this title and the insurer so notifies the commissioner.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-44-103. Acquisition of control of or merger with domestic insurer.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) No person other than the issuer shall make a tender offer for or a request or invitation for tenders of, or agreement to exchange securities for or otherwise acquire, any voting security or any security convertible into a voting security of a domestic insurer or of any other person controlling a domestic insurer if, after consummation, the person would, directly or indirectly, be in control of the insurer and no person shall enter into an agreement to merge with or otherwise acquire control of a domestic insurer unless:</p>
                <p>(i) Thirty (30) days prior to the above transactions the person has filed with the commissioner and has sent to the insurer a statement containing the information required by this section;</p>
                <p>(ii) The offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition has been approved by the commissioner. For purposes of this section a domestic insurer includes any person controlling a domestic insurer unless the person, as determined by the commissioner, is either directly or through its affiliates primarily engaged in business other than the business of insurance. For the purposes of this section, "person" does not include any securities broker holding, in the usual and customary broker's function, less than twenty percent (20%) of the voting securities of an insurance company or of any person which controls an insurance company; and</p>
                <p>(iii) If any controlling person of a domestic insurer is seeking to divest its controlling interest in the domestic insurer in any manner, the controlling person has filed with the commissioner, with a copy to the insurer, confidential notice of its proposed divestiture at least thirty (30) days prior to the cessation of control. The commissioner shall determine those instances in which the party seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest in an insurer will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. The information shall remain confidential until the conclusion of the transaction unless the commissioner, in his discretion determines that confidential treatment will interfere with enforcement of this section. If the statement referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection is otherwise filed by the acquiring person or as otherwise required, this paragraph shall not apply.</p>
                <p>(b) The preacquisition statement required by subsection</p>
                <p>(a) of this section shall be made under oath or affirmation and shall contain the following:</p>
                <p>(i) The name and address of each person by whom or on whose behalf the merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (a) of this section is to be made and the following:</p>
                <p>(A) If the person is an individual, his principal occupation and all offices and positions held during the past five (5) years, and any conviction of crimes other than minor traffic violations during the past ten (10) years;</p>
                <p>(B) If the person is not an individual, a report of the nature of its business operations during the past five (5) years or for such lesser period as the person and any predecessors of the person have been in existence, an informative description of the business intended to be done by the person and the person's subsidiaries, and a list of all individuals who are or who have been selected to become directors or executive officers of the person, or who perform or will perform functions appropriate to these positions. The list shall include for each individual the information required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>

                <p>(iii) Fully audited financial information as to the earnings and financial condition of each acquiring party for the preceding five (5) fiscal years or for any lesser period the acquiring party and any of its predecessors have been in existence, and similar unaudited information as of a date not earlier than ninety (90) days before the filing of the statement;</p>

                <p>(xi) The term of any agreement, contract or understanding made with or proposed to be made with any broker-dealer as to solicitation of securities referred to in subsection (a) of this section for tender, and the amount of any fees, commissions or other compensation to be paid to broker-dealers;</p>
                <p>(xii) An agreement by the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section that it will provide the annual report, specified in W.S. 26-44-104(n), for so long as control exists;</p>
                <p>(xiii) An acknowledgement by the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section that the person and all subsidiaries within its control in the insurance holding company system will provide information to the commissioner upon request as necessary to evaluate enterprise risk to the insurer; and</p>
                <p>(xiv) Any additional information as the commissioner may by rule or regulation prescribe as necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders of the insurer or in the public interest.</p>
                <p>(c) If the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section is a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group, the commissioner may require that the information called for by subsection (b) of this section shall be given with respect to each partner of the partnership or limited partnership, each member of the syndicate or group, and each person who controls the partner or member. If any partner, member or person is a corporation, or the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section is a corporation, the commissioner may require that the information called for by subsection (b) of this section shall be given with respect to the corporation, each officer and director of the corporation, and each person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation.</p>
                <p>(d) If any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statement filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer pursuant to this section, an amendment setting forth the change, together with copies of all documents and other material relevant to the change, shall be filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer within two (2) business days after the person learns of the change.</p>
                <p>(e) If any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition referred to in subsection (a) of this section is proposed to be made by means of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 or in circumstances requiring the disclosure of similar information under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or under a state law requiring similar registration or disclosure, the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section may utilize documents prepared for those laws in furnishing the information called for by this section.</p>
                <p>(f) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsection (a) of this section unless after a public hearing he finds that:</p>
                <p>(i) After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsection (a) of this section would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;</p>
                <p>(ii) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would substantially lessen competition in insurance in Wyoming or tend to create a monopoly in Wyoming. The commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time;</p>
                <p>(iii) The financial condition of any acquiring party might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;</p>
                <p>(iv) The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;</p>
                <p>(v) The competence, experience and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or</p>
                <p>(vi) The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.</p>
                <p>(g) The public hearing referred to in subsection (f) of this section shall be held within thirty (30) days after the statement required by subsection (a) of this section is filed, and at least twenty (20) days notice of the hearing shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement. Not less than seven (7) days notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to any other persons designated by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make a determination within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing. At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in district court. All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than three (3) days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.</p>
                <p>(h) If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one (1) commissioner, the public hearing referred to in subsection (g) of this section may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section. The person shall file the statement referred to in subsection</p>
                <p>(a) of this section with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners within five (5) days of making the request for a public hearing. A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt- out within ten (10) days of the receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section. A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled. The commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend the hearing in person or by telecommunication.</p>
                <p>(j) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the commissioner that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and regulations of this state shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(k) The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control.</p>
                <p>(m) The provisions of this section do not apply to:</p>
                <p>(i) Any transaction which is subject to the provisions of W.S. 26-24-146 through 26-24-149;</p>
                <p>(ii) Any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition which the commissioner by order shall exempt as not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer.</p>
                <p>(n) The following shall be violations of this section:</p>
                <p>(i) The failure to file any statement, amendment or other material required to be filed pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has given approval.</p>
                <p>(o) The Wyoming courts have jurisdiction over every person who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and overall actions arising out of violations of this section. Any person filing a statement with the commissioner appoints the commissioner as his agent for service of process for actions arising under this section. The commissioner shall send copies of all legal services by certified mail to the appropriate person at his last known address.</p>

Unless the commissioner by rule, regulation or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments or guarantees involving one-half of one percent (.5%) or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of December 31, of the year immediately preceding are not material for purposes of this section.</p>
                <p>(f) Each registered insurer shall report to the commissioner all dividends and other distributions to shareholders within fifteen (15) business days following the declaration of the dividend or distribution.</p>

In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted. The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the commissioner, or if the disclaimer is deemed to have been approved.</p>
                <p>(n) Beginning July 1, 2014, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report. The report shall, to the best of the ultimate controlling person's knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p>
                <p>(o) The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement or enterprise risk filing required by this section within the time specified for filing shall be a violation of this section.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-44-105. Transactions within a holding company system.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Transactions within an insurance holding company system to which an insurer subject to registration is a party shall be subject to the following standards:</p>
                <p>(i) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;</p>
                <p>(ii) Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;</p>
                <p>(iii) Expenses incurred and payment received shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied;</p>
                <p>(iv) The books, accounts and records of each party to all the transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the nature and details of the transactions including any accounting information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties;</p>
                <p>(v) The insurer's surplus as regards policy holders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs as set forth in W.S. 26-44-108; and</p>
                <p>(vi) Agreements for cost sharing services and management shall include provisions as required by regulation issued by the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(b) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its insurance holding company system, including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed pursuant to this section, which are subject to any materiality standards contained in subsection (b) of this section, shall not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into the transaction at least thirty (30) days prior to the transaction or a shorter period as the commissioner may permit and the commissioner has not disapproved it within that period. The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice shall be reported, within thirty (30) days after a termination of a previously filed agreement, to the commissioner for determination of the type of filing required, if any. In assessing transactions under this subsection, the commissioner shall consider whether the transactions comply with subsection (a) of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders. The transactions to be considered are:</p>
                <p>(i) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees or investments if on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the transactions are equal to or exceed:</p>
                <p>(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent (25%) of surplus as regards policyholders;</p>
                <p>(B) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets.</p>
                <p>(ii) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes the loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of the transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making the loans or extensions of credit if on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the transactions are equal to or exceed:</p>
                <p>(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent (25%) of surplus as regards policyholders;</p>
                <p>(B) With respect to life insurers, three percent (3%) of the insurer's admitted assets.</p>
                <p>(iii) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including all reinsurance pooling agreements, agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three (3) years, equals or exceeds five percent (5%) of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one (1) or more affiliates of the insurer;</p>
                <p>(iv) All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and</p>
                <p>(v) Any material transactions, specified by regulation, which the commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders.</p>
                <p>(c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transaction which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.</p>
                <p>(d) A domestic insurer shall not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the notification requirement set forth in subsection (b) of this section and thus the review that would otherwise occur. If the commissioner determines that separate transactions were entered into over any twelve (12) month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise his authority under W.S. 26-44-113.</p>
                <p>(e) The commissioner shall be notified within thirty (30) days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one (1) corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent (10%) of the corporation's voting securities.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-44-106. Dividends and other distributions.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A domestic insurer shall not pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until thirty (30) days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration of dividend and has not disapproved payment, or the commissioner has approved the payment whichever is shorter.</p>
                <p>(b) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve (12) months exceeds the lesser of:</p>
                <p>(i) Ten percent (10%) of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve (12) month period ending December 31 of the year immediately preceding, nor pro rata distributions of the insurer's own securities.</p>
                <p>(c) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two (2) calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</p>
                <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the commissioner's approval. This declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until the commissioner has approved the payment or the commissioner has not disapproved the payment within thirty (30) days, whichever is shorter.</p>

                <p>(a) The officers and directors of the insurer are not relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law because the control of the domestic insurer lies with any other person. The insurer shall be managed to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this title.</p>
                <p>(b) Nothing in this act shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property or services with one (1) or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of W.S. 26-44-105(a).</p>

                <p>(a) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:</p>
                <p>(i) The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria;</p>
                <p>(ii) The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;</p>
                <p>(iii) The number and size of risks insured in each line of business;</p>
                <p>(iv) The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks;</p>
                <p>(v) The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;</p>
                <p>(vi) The quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;</p>
                <p>(vii) The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio;</p>
                <p>(viii) The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;</p>
                <p>(ix) The adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and</p>
                <p>(x) The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates.</p>
                <p>(b) The commissioner may treat any investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever he deems that treatment necessary.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-44-109. Examination.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The commissioner may examine any insurer registered under W.S. 26-44-104 or any affiliate of the insurer in accordance with this section and the provisions of W.S. 26-2-116 through 26-2-124 to ascertain the financial condition of the insurer, including the enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party, or by any entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company system, or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated basis. The commissioner may retain at the insurer's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff reasonably necessary to conduct the examination. Any person so retained shall be under the direction and control of the commissioner and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.</p>
                <p>(b) To determine compliance with this chapter, the commissioner may order any insurer registered under W.S. 26-44-104 to produce information not in the possession of the insurer if the insurer can obtain access to this information pursuant to contractual relationships, statutory obligations or other method. In the event the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the commissioner, the insurer shall provide the commissioner a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of the information. Whenever it appears to the commissioner that the detailed explanation is without merit, the commissioner may, after notice and hearing, suspend or revoke the insurer's license or certificate.</p>
                <p>(c) In the event the insurer fails to comply with an order, the commissioner shall have the power to examine the affiliates to obtain the information. The commissioner shall also have the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths and to examine under oath any person for purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.</p>

                <p>(a) All information, documents and copies of the documents and information obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination made pursuant to W.S. 26-44-109 and all information reported pursuant to W.S. 26-44-103(b)(xii) and (xiii), 26-44-104 through 26-44-108 and 26-44-119 shall be confidential, shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be disclosed by the commissioner, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or any person, except as authorized by and in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 26-2-113(d), without the prior written consent of the insurer to which the information pertains. The commissioner, after giving the insurer and its affiliates notice and opportunity to be heard, may determine that the interest of policyholders, shareholders or the public will be served by the publication of the information, in which event he may publish all or any part of the information as he deems appropriate.</p>
                <p>(b) Neither the commissioner nor any person who received documents, materials or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner or with whom the documents, materials or other information are shared pursuant to this act shall be permitted or required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential documents, materials or information subject to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(c) Notwithstanding W.S. 26-2-113, the commissioner shall only share confidential and privileged documents, material or information reported pursuant to W.S. 26-44-104(n) with commissioners of states having statutes or regulations substantially similar to Wyoming insurance statutes and who have agreed in writing not to disclose the information.</p>
                <p>(d) In addition to any other authorities provided by law, the commissioner shall enter into written agreements with the NAIC governing sharing and use of information provided pursuant to this act consistent with this subsection which shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Specify procedures and protocols regarding the confidentiality and security of information shared with the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries pursuant to this act, including procedures and protocols for sharing by the NAIC with other state, federal or international regulators;</p>

                <p>(iv) Require the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries to consent to intervention by an insurer in any judicial or administrative action in which the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries may be required to disclose confidential information about the insurer shared with the NAIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries pursuant to this chapter.</p>
                <p>(e) The sharing of information by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or rulemaking and the commissioner is solely responsible for the administration, execution and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.</p>
                <p>(f) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials or information shall occur as a result of disclosure to the commissioner under this chapter or as a result of sharing as authorized under this chapter.</p>
                <p>(g) Documents, materials or other information in the possession or control of the NAIC pursuant to this chapter shall be confidential by law and privileged, shall not be a public record under W.S. 16-4-201 through 16-4-205, shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action.</p>

                <p>(a) Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any insurer or any director, officer, employee or agent of the insurer has committed or is about to commit a violation of this act or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner pursuant to this act, the commissioner may apply to the district court for the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located or, if the insurer has no office in this state, then to the district court for Laramie county for an injunction.</p>
                <p>(b) No security which is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or which is acquired or to be acquired, in violation of this act or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner pursuant to this act may be voted at any shareholder's meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though the securities were not issued and outstanding. No action taken at any meeting shall be invalidated by the voting of the securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the Wyoming courts have so ordered. If an insurer or the commissioner has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in violation of this act or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner pursuant to this act, the insurer or the commissioner may apply to the court for the county in which the insurer has its principle place of business to enjoin any action violating this act, to enjoin the voting of any security acquired in violation of this act, to void any vote of such a security already cast at any meeting of shareholders and for other equitable relief.</p>
                <p>(c) In any case where a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of this act or any rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner, the commissioner or insurer may request the district court to seize or sequester any voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by the person, and issue an order appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this act the sites of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers shall be deemed to be in Wyoming.</p>

                <p>(a) Any insurer failing, without just cause, to file any registration statement as required in this act shall be required, after notice and hearing, to pay a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day's delay, to be recovered by the commissioner. The penalty recovered shall be paid into the general fund. The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the insurer demonstrates to the commissioner that the imposition of the penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer.</p>
                <p>(b) Any director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates, participates in, or assents to, or who knowingly permits any of the officers or agents of the insurer to engage in transactions or make investments which violate this act is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</p>
                <p>(c) Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any insurer subject to this act or any director, officer, employee or agent of the insurer has engaged in any transaction or entered into a contract which is subject to this act and which would not have been approved had approval been requested, the commissioner may order the insurer to cease and desist immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract. After notice and hearing the commissioner may also order the insurer to void any contracts and restore the status quo if the action is in the best interest of the policyholders, creditors or the public.</p>
                <p>(d) Any officer, director or employee of an insurance holding company system who willfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes or causes to be made any false statements or false reports or false filings with the intent to deceive the commissioner in the performance of his duties under this article is guilty of a felony and shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), imprisoned for not more than ten (10) years, or both.</p>
                <p>(e) Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has committed a violation of W.S. 26-44-103 which prevents the full understanding of the enterprise risk to the insurer by affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order in accordance with chapter 28 of this title.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, if an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer any distribution or payment made at any time during the one (1) year preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation which is either:</p>
                <p>(i) From any parent corporation or holding company or person or affiliate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock paid by the insurer on its capital stock; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or its subsidiary to a director, officer or employee.</p>
                <p>(b) A distribution shall not be recoverable if the parent or affiliate shows that, when paid, the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.</p>
                <p>(c) Any person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions or payments the person received under subsection (a) of this section. Any person who otherwise controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately.</p>
                <p>(d) The maximum amount recoverable under this section shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds.</p>
                <p>(e) To the extent that any person liable under subsection</p>
                <p>(c) of this section is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, its parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it.</p>

                <p>(a) With respect to any insurer registered under W.S. 26-44-104, and in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall also have the power to participate in a supervisory college for any domestic insurer that is part of an insurance holding company system with international operations in order to determine compliance by the insurer with this chapter. The powers of the commissioner with respect to supervisory colleges include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Initiating the establishment of a supervisory college;</p>
                <p>(ii) Clarifying the membership and participation of other supervisors in the supervisory college;</p>
                <p>(iii) Clarifying the functions of the supervisory college and the role of other regulators, including the establishment of a group-wide supervisor;</p>
                <p>(iv) Coordinating the ongoing activities of the supervisory college, including planning meetings, supervisory activities, and processes for information sharing; and</p>
                <p>(v) Establishing a crisis management plan.</p>
                <p>(b) Each registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in a supervisory college in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, including reasonable travel expenses. For purposes of this section, a supervisory college may be convened as either a temporary or permanent forum for communication and cooperation between the regulators charged with the supervision of the insurer or its affiliates, and the commissioner may establish a regular assessment to the insurer for the payment of these expenses.</p>
                <p>(c) In order to assess the business strategy, financial position, legal and regulatory position, risk exposure, risk management and governance processes, and as part of the examination of individual insurers in accordance with W.S. 26-44-109, the commissioner may participate in a supervisory college with other regulators charged with supervision of the insurer or its affiliates, including other state, federal and international regulatory agencies. The commissioner may enter into agreements providing the basis for cooperation between the commissioner and the other regulatory agencies, and the activities of the supervisory college. Nothing in this section shall delegate to the supervisory college the authority of the commissioner to regulate or supervise the insurer or its affiliates within his jurisdiction.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>26-44-119. Group wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The commissioner is authorized to act as the group wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group in accordance with this section. However, the commissioner may acknowledge a regulatory official from another jurisdiction as the group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group where the internationally active insurance group:</p>
                <p>(i) Does not have substantial insurance operations in the United States;</p>
                <p>(ii) Has substantial insurance operations in the United States, but not in Wyoming; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Has substantial insurance operations in the United States and Wyoming, but the commissioner has determined pursuant to the factors set forth in subsections (c) and (j) of this section that the other regulatory official is the appropriate group wide supervisor.</p>
                <p>(b) An insurance holding company system that is not an internationally active insurance group may request that the commissioner make a determination or acknowledgement as to a group wide supervisor pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p>(c) In cooperation with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall identify one (1) group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The commissioner may determine that the commissioner is the appropriate group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in Wyoming. However, the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The commissioner shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment:</p>
                <p>(i) The place of domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group that hold the largest share of the group's written premiums, assets or liabilities;</p>
                <p>(ii) The place of domicile of the top tiered insurer in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;</p>
                <p>(iii) The location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;</p>
                <p>(iv) Whether another regulatory official seeks to act as the group wide supervisor under a regulatory system the commissioner determines:</p>
                <p>(A) To be substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of Wyoming; or</p>
                <p>(B) Sufficiently provides group wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis and cooperation with other regulatory officials.</p>
                <p>(v) Whether another regulatory official provides the commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.</p>
                <p>(d) If the commissioner is identified under this section as the group wide supervisor, the commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group wide supervisor shall be made after consideration of the factors listed in paragraphs (c)(i) through (v) of this section and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group and in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.</p>
                <p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a regulatory official, other than the commissioner, is acting as the group wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group wide supervisor. However, the commissioner shall make a determination or acknowledgement under subsection</p>
                <p>(c) or (d) of this section as to the appropriate group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group if a material change in the internationally active insurance group results in either of the following:</p>
                <p>(i) The internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in Wyoming holding the largest share of the group's premiums, assets or liabilities;</p>
                <p>(ii) Wyoming being the place of domicile of the top tiered insurer in the internationally active insurance group's insurance holding company system.</p>
                <p>(f) Pursuant to W.S. 26-44-109, the commissioner may collect from any insurer registered under W.S. 26-44-104 all information necessary to determine whether the commissioner may act as the group wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the commissioner may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group wide supervisor. Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group wide supervision by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the insurer registered pursuant to W.S. 26-44-104 and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group. The internationally active insurance group shall have not less than thirty (30) days from the date of notification to provide the commissioner with additional information pertinent to the pending determination.</p>
                <p>(g) The commissioner shall publish on the department's website the identity of each internationally active insurance group that the commissioner has determined is subject to group wide supervision by the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(h) If the commissioner is the group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may do any of the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:</p>
                <p>(A) The material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and</p>
                <p>(B) Reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place to address the identified enterprise risks.</p>
                <p>(ii) Request from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the commissioner's supervision information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk including information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding any of the following:</p>
                <p>(A) Governance, risk assessment and management;</p>
                <p>(B) Capital adequacy; and</p>
                <p>(C) Material intercompany transactions.</p>
                <p>(iii) Coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;</p>
                <p>(iv) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of W.S. 26-44-110, communicate with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information through supervisory colleges as set forth in W.S. 26-44-118 or otherwise;</p>
                <p>(v) Enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under W.S. 26-44-104, any member of the internationally active insurance group or any other state, federal or international regulatory agency on behalf of members of the internationally active insurance group that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify the commissioner's role as group wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials. The agreements or documentation shall not serve as evidence in any proceeding that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in Wyoming is doing business in Wyoming or is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Wyoming;</p>
                <p>(vi) Conduct any other group wide supervision activities consistent with this section as deemed necessary by the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(j) If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the NAIC is the group wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner may reasonably cooperate through a supervisory college or otherwise with group wide supervision undertaken by the group wide supervisor, provided that:</p>
                <p>(i) The commissioner's cooperation complies with the laws of Wyoming; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The regulatory official acknowledged as the group wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities as a group wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups as applicable. Where the recognition and cooperation is not reasonably reciprocal, the commissioner may refuse recognition and cooperation.</p>
                <p>(k) The commissioner may enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under W.S. 26- 44-104, any affiliate of the insurer or any other state, federal or international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group that provide the basis for or otherwise clarify a regulatory official's role as group wide supervisor.</p>
                <p>(m) A registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in the administration of this section, including the costs to engage attorneys, actuaries or other professionals and all reasonable travel costs.</p>

In all other cases the insurer shall file the contract, or any amendment to a contract, with the commissioner within fifteen (15) days after it has been signed;</p>

                  <p>(a) A domestic health organization shall, annually on or prior to March 1, prepare and submit to the commissioner a report of its RBC levels as of the end of the calendar year just ended, in a form and containing information as required by the RBC instructions. In addition, every domestic health organization shall file its RBC report:</p>
                  <p>(i) With the NAIC in accordance with the RBC instructions; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) With the insurance commissioner in any state in which the health organization is authorized to do business, if the insurance commissioner has notified the health organization of its request in writing, in which case the health organization shall file its RBC report not later than the later of:</p>
                  <p>(A) Fifteen (15) days from the receipt of notice to file its RBC report with that state; or</p>
                  <p>(B) March 1.</p>
                  <p>(b) A health organization's RBC shall be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the RBC instructions and this article. The formula shall take the following into account, and may adjust for the covariance between the following which are determined in each case by applying the factors in the manner set forth in the RBC instructions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Asset risk;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Credit risk;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Underwriting risk; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) All other business risks and other relevant risks as are set forth in the RBC instructions.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a domestic health organization files an RBC report which in the judgment of the commissioner is inaccurate, the commissioner shall adjust the RBC report to correct the inaccuracy and shall notify the health organization of the adjustment. The notice shall contain a statement of the reasons for the adjustment. An RBC report as so adjusted is referred to as an "adjusted RBC report".</p>
                  <p>(d) An excess of capital over the amount produced by the risk-based capital requirements contained in this article and the formulas, schedules and instructions referenced in this article is desirable in the business of health insurance. Accordingly, health organizations should seek to maintain capital above the RBC levels required by this article. Additional capital is used and useful in the insurance business and helps to secure a health organization against various risks inherent in, or affecting, the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in this article.</p>

                  <p>(f) RBC instructions, RBC reports, adjusted RBC reports, RBC plans and revised RBC plans shall not be used by the commissioner for ratemaking nor considered or introduced as evidence in any rate proceeding nor used by the commissioner to calculate or derive any elements of an appropriate premium level or rate of return for any line of insurance that a health organization or any affiliate is authorized to write.</p>

                <p>(a) An insurer shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter, if:</p>
                <p>(i) The insurer has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium, including international direct and assumed premium but excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, of less than five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000.00); and</p>
                <p>(ii) The insurance group of which the insurer is a member has annual direct written and unaffiliated assumed premium including international direct and assumed premium, but excluding premiums reinsured with the federal crop insurance corporation and federal flood program, of less than one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000.00).</p>
                <p>(b) If an insurer qualifies for exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this section, but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does not qualify for exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, then the ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to W.S. 26-51-105 shall include every insurer within the insurance group. This requirement may be satisfied by the submission of more than one (1) ORSA summary report for any combination of insurers provided any combination of reports includes every insurer within the insurance group.</p>
                <p>(c) If an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this section, but the insurance group of which it is a member qualifies for exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, then the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to W.S. 26-51-105 shall be the report applicable to that insurer.</p>
                <p>(d) An insurer that does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this chapter based upon unique circumstances. In deciding whether to grant the insurer's request for waiver, the commissioner may consider the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure and any other factor the commissioner considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group of which the insurer is a member. If the insurer is part of an insurance group with insurers domiciled in more than one (1) state, the commissioner shall coordinate with the lead state commissioner and with the other domiciliary commissioners in considering whether to grant the insurer's request for a waiver.</p>
                <p>(e) Notwithstanding the exemptions stated in this section:</p>
                <p>(i) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report based on unique circumstances including, but not limited to, the type and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure, federal agency requests and international supervisor requests;</p>
                <p>(ii) The commissioner may require that an insurer maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary report if the insurer has risk-based capital for company action level event as set forth in W.S. 26-48-103 and 26-48-203, meets one (1) or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous financial condition as defined in W.S. 26-3-116, or otherwise exhibits qualities of a troubled insurer as determined by the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(f) If an insurer that qualifies for an exemption pursuant to subsection (a) of this section subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to changes in premium as reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, the insurer shall have one (1) year following the year the threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirements of this chapter.</p>

                <p>(a) To place a drug on a maximum allowable cost list, a pharmacy benefit manager shall ensure that the drug is:</p>
                <p>(i) Rated "A" or "B" in the most recent version of the United States Food and Drug Administration's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book), or rated "NR" or "NA," or has a similar rating, by a nationally recognized reference;</p>
                <p>(ii) Generally available for purchase by retail pharmacies in the state from national or regional wholesalers;</p>
                <p>(iii) Not obsolete or temporarily unavailable.</p>

                <p>(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, if a therapeutically equivalent generic drug is unavailable or has limited market presence, an insurer or pharmacy benefit manager may place on a maximum allowable cost list a drug that has:</p>

                <p>(ii) An "NR" or "NA" rating, or a similar rating, by a nationally recognized reference.</p>
                <p>(d) A pharmacy benefit manager shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Make available to each network provider at the beginning of the term of the network provider's contract, and upon renewal of the contract, the sources utilized to determine the maximum allowable cost pricing;</p>

                <p>(iii) Provide a process for network providers to readily access the maximum allowable cost applicable to that provider;</p>
                <p>(iv) Review and update applicable maximum allowable cost price information at least once every seven (7) business days to reflect any modification of maximum allowable cost pricing; and</p>
                <p>(v) Ensure that dispensing fees are not included in the calculation of maximum allowable cost.</p>
                <p>(e) A pharmacy benefit manager shall establish a process by which a contracted pharmacy, or the pharmacy's designee who holds a contract with the pharmacy benefit manager, can appeal the provider's reimbursement for a drug subject to maximum allowable cost pricing. A contracted pharmacy, or the pharmacy's designee who holds a contract with the pharmacy benefit manager, shall have up to ten (10) business days after dispensing a drug subject to a maximum allowable cost in which to appeal the amount of the maximum allowable cost. A pharmacy benefit manager shall respond to the appeal within ten (10) business days after the contracted pharmacy makes the appeal.</p>
                <p>(f) If a maximum allowable cost appeal is denied, the pharmacy benefit manager shall provide to the appealing pharmacy, or the pharmacy's designee who holds a contract with the pharmacy benefit manager, the reason for the denial and the national drug code number for the drug that is available for purchase by pharmacies in the state from national or regional wholesalers at a price at or below the maximum allowable cost.</p>
                <p>(g) If an appeal is upheld, the pharmacy benefit manager shall make an adjustment to the applicable maximum allowable cost no later than one (1) day after the date of the determination and make the adjustment applicable to all similarly situated network pharmacy providers, as determined by the insurer or pharmacy benefit manager. The pharmacy benefit manager shall allow the appealing pharmacy to reverse and rebill the claim which was the subject of the appeal.</p>
                <p>(h) This section shall apply to a contracted pharmacy, or the pharmacy's designee who holds a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager, entered into, renewed or extended on or after July 1, 2016, and to contracts on and after July 1, 2017.</p>
                <p>(j) A pharmacy benefit manager may not, by contract or otherwise, prohibit or penalize a pharmacy or pharmacist for:</p>
                <p>(i) Disclosing information to a covered individual regarding any cost differential that the covered individual must pay for a particular prescription under the individual's prescription drug benefit or outside of the individual's prescription drug benefit;</p>
                <p>(ii) Offering to a covered individual a more affordable alternative if one is available.</p>

                <p>(a) An insurer, or the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, shall, no later than June 1 of each calendar year, submit to the commissioner a corporate governance annual disclosure that contains the information described in W.S. 26-54-105. Notwithstanding any request from the commissioner made pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, if the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required by this section to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state for the insurance group, in accordance with the laws of the lead state and under the guidance of the procedures outlined in the most recent financial analysis handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p>
                <p>(b) The CGAD shall include a signature of the insurer's or insurance group's chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of that individual's belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices disclosed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.</p>
                <p>(c) An insurer not required to submit a CGAD under this section shall do so upon the commissioner's request.</p>
                <p>(d) For purposes of completing the CGAD, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level or the individual legal entity level, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the CGAD disclosures at the level at which the insurer's or insurance group's risk appetite is determined, or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the three (3) criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in the level of reporting.</p>
                <p>(e) The review of the CGAD and any additional requests for information shall be made through the lead state under the guidance of the procedures contained in the most recent financial analysis handbook referenced in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(f) Insurers providing information substantially similar to the information required by this act in other documents provided to the commissioner, including any statements filed pursuant to W.S. 26-44-104, or other state or federal filings provided to the department, shall not be required to duplicate that information in the CGAD, but shall be required to cross reference and identify where the document may be located by the commissioner.</p>

The commissioner may request additional information deemed material and necessary to provide the commissioner with a clear understanding of corporate governance policies and the reporting, information systems or controls used to implement those policies.</p>

                <p>(b) Neither the commissioner nor any other person who receives documents, materials or other information subject to subsection (a) of this section, through examination or otherwise, while acting under the authority of the commissioner, or with whom such documents, materials or other information are shared pursuant to this act, shall testify in any private civil action concerning the documents, materials or other information.</p>
                <p>(c) In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's regulatory duties, the commissioner may:</p>
                <p>(i) Upon request, share documents, materials or other information, including confidential and privileged documents, materials or other information, which may include proprietary or trade secret information, with other state, federal and international financial regulatory agencies, including members of any supervisory college as defined under W.S. 26-44-118, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and with third party consultants pursuant to W.S. 26-54-107, provided that the recipient agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the documents, materials or other information and has verified in writing the legal authority to maintain confidentiality;</p>
                <p>(ii) Receive documents, materials or other information, including confidential and privileged documents, materials or other information, which may include proprietary or trade secret information, from regulatory officials of other state, federal and international financial regulatory agencies, including members of any supervisory college as defined under W.S. 26-44-118 and from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The commissioner shall maintain as confidential and privileged any documents, materials or other information received under this paragraph with notice or the understanding that it is confidential and privileged under the law of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, materials or other information.</p>
                <p>(d) The sharing of documents, materials or other information by the commissioner pursuant to this act shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or rulemaking, and the commissioner is solely responsible for the administration, execution and enforcement of the provisions of this act.</p>
                <p>(e) No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials or other information shall occur as a result of disclosure of such information to the commissioner under this section or as a result of any sharing authorized by this act.</p>

The agreement shall provide that the recipient agrees in writing to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the CGAD related documents, materials or other information and has verified in writing the legal authority to maintain confidentiality;</p>
                <p>(iii) A provision specifying that ownership of CGAD related information shared with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a person retained pursuant to subsection (a) of this section remains with the department and use of the information by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or a person retained pursuant to subsection (a) of this section is subject to the direction of the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(iv) A provision that prohibits the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any person retained pursuant to subsection (a) of this section from storing the information shared pursuant to this act in a permanent database after the underlying analysis is completed;</p>
