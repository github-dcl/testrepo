                <p>(a) When personal property not subject to be summarily destroyed is seized or held by any peace officer pursuant to any law of this state, or when property seized by any peace officer is delivered to the appropriate law enforcement agency under provisions other than W.S. 35-7-1049, or property is taken into custody as lost, mislaid or abandoned, the head of the law enforcement agency shall forthwith ascertain as closely as practicable:</p>
                <p>(i) The approximate value of the property;</p>

The head of the law enforcement agency shall maintain custody of the property pending an order of disposal by the court pursuant to this section unless the property is otherwise released according to this section.</p>
                <p>(c) If the property is lost, mislaid, abandoned or unclaimed or if possession of the property is unlawful, the law enforcement agency shall seek in circuit court or district court an order to show cause why the property should not be sold or forfeited and sold at public auction or transferred to the use of the law enforcement agency. If the lawful owner of the property can reasonably be ascertained, the property shall be delivered to him without judicial action unless the property constitutes evidence of a crime, the possession of the property would be unlawful or ownership and interest are in dispute.</p>
                <p>(d) Notice and proceedings on the order to show cause shall be according to the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, provided notice by publication shall be once each week for two (2) consecutive weeks. The trial of the issues shall be by the court.</p>
                <p>(e) On final hearing the order to show cause shall be taken as prima facie evidence that the property is abandoned or unclaimed and is sufficient for a judgment of forfeiture in the absence of other proof.</p>
                <p>(f) In disputed ownership cases the burden shall be upon the claimants to show that they are the lawful owners or have a legally recognizable interest in the property.</p>
                <p>(g) When the property is encumbered, the court shall, after deducting costs, direct the payment of the encumbrance from the proceeds of any sale of the property or distribute the property equitably between those persons having a legal interest.</p>
                <p>(h) The proceedings and judgment of forfeiture shall be in rem and shall be primarily against the property itself.</p>
                <p>(j) Upon the entry of a judgment of forfeiture the court shall determine the disposition to be made of the property, which may include the destruction or sale of the property or the allocation of the property to some other governmental function or use or otherwise, as the court may determine.</p>
                <p>(k) Sale of the property shall be at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after two (2) weeks public notice as the court may direct.</p>
                <p>(m) Upon the application of any claimant, the court may fix the value of a forfeitable interest in the seized property and permit the claimant to redeem the property upon the payment of a sum equal to the value, which sum shall be disposed of as would the proceeds of the sale of the property under a judgment of forfeiture.</p>
                <p>(n) The balance of the proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in the general operating account of the state, county or municipal entity that has fiscal authority over the law enforcement agency confiscating the property.</p>
                <p>(o) This section does not apply to property which is subject to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, W.S. 34-24-101 through 34-24-140.</p>
                <p>(p) For purposes of this section, seized property that is not subject to W.S. 35-7-1049 may be summarily destroyed, provided the lawful owner has been contacted and has declined to take possession of the property, including:</p>
                <p>(i) Evidence that is no longer needed for the prosecution of a case, or needed for purposes of appellate review of the case;</p>
                <p>(ii) Evidence in misdemeanor cases in which the district attorney has determined that no suspect has been identified or prosecution has not been pursued for at least one (1) year;</p>
                <p>(iii) Evidence in felony cases in which the district attorney has determined that no suspect has been identified or prosecution has not been pursued for at least five (5) years;</p>
                <p>(iv) Soiled, defective, broken or demolished personal property, or waste.</p>
                <p>(q) Items of found property with a value of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for which the owner cannot be located, or if the owner has not responded after contact was attempted by the law enforcement agency, may be disposed of after the latter of:</p>
                <p>(i) Thirty (30) days after the agency has determined that the owner cannot be located; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Thirty (30) days after the agency has attempted on at least three (3) nonconsecutive days to contact the owner without response from the owner.</p>
                <p>(r) Law enforcement agencies shall preserve biological material that was seized or recovered as evidence in the investigation or prosecution that resulted in a conviction or adjudication as a delinquent for a crime of violence and not consumed in previous DNA testing. The biological material shall be preserved for five (5) years or, except as provided in this section, for as long as any person incarcerated in connection with the case or investigation remains in custody, whichever is longer. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this section, effective July 1, 2008 a law enforcement agency may dispose of the biological material after five (5) years if the law enforcement agency notifies any person who remains incarcerated in connection with the investigation or prosecution and any counsel of record for such person, or if there is no counsel of record, the state public defender, of the intention to dispose of the evidence and the law enforcement agency affords the person not less than one hundred eighty (180) days after the notification to file a motion for DNA testing or preservation of the biological material. The law enforcement agency shall not be required to preserve evidence that is required to be, and has been, returned to its rightful owner, or is of such a size, bulk or physical character as to render retention impracticable. If practicable, the law enforcement agency shall remove and preserve representative portions of the biological material sufficient to permit future DNA testing before returning or disposing of the material.</p>
                <p>(s) Whoever willfully or maliciously destroys, alters, conceals or tampers with evidence that is required to be preserved under subsection (r) of this section with the intent to impair the integrity of that evidence, to prevent that evidence from being subjected to DNA testing or to prevent the production or use of that evidence in an official proceeding shall upon conviction be subject to a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), imprisonment for not more than five (5) years, or both.</p>

                  <p>(i) Its duration;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance;</p>

Such payment may be in a lump sum or in installments as provided in the contract.</p>
                  <p>(c) The terms and provisions of this compact shall be a part of any contract entered into by the authority of or pursuant thereto, and nothing in any such contract shall be inconsistent therewith.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IV</p>
                  <p>Procedures and Rights</p>
                  <p>(a) Whenever the duly constituted judicial or administrative authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary in order to provide adequate quarters and care or desirable in order to provide an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.</p>
                  <p>(b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.</p>
                  <p>(c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided that the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of article III.</p>
                  <p>(d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have the benefit of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.</p>
                  <p>(e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be cared for and treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. Costs of records made pursuant to this subdivision shall be borne by the sending state.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.</p>
                  <p>(j) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V</p>
                  <p>Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State; Extradition</p>
                  <p>(a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.</p>
                  <p>(b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>Federal Aid</p>
                  <p>Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VII</p>
                  <p>Entry into Force</p>
                  <p>This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two (2) contiguous states from among the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. For the purposes of this article, Alaska and Hawaii shall be deemed contiguous to each other; to any and all of the states of California, Oregon and Washington; and to Guam.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states, or any other state contiguous to at least one (1) party state upon similar action by such state. Guam may become party to this compact by taking action similar to that provided for joinder by any other eligible party state and upon the consent of congress to such joinder. For the purposes of this article, Guam shall be deemed contiguous to Alaska, Hawaii, California, Oregon and Washington.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
                  <p>Withdrawal and Termination</p>
                  <p>This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until two (2) years after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IX</p>
                  <p>Other Arrangements Unaffected</p>
                  <p>Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE X</p>
                  <p>Construction and Severability</p>
                  <p>The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p>(a) Following a hearing under W.S. 7-3-508(a) and upon a finding that conduct constituting stalking or sexual assault has been committed, the court shall enter an order of protection ordering the respondent to refrain from any further acts of stalking or sexual assault involving the victim or any other person. As a part of any order of protection, the court may direct that the respondent:</p>
                  <p>(i) Stay away from the home, school, business or place of employment of the victim or any other locations the court may describe in the order; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Refrain from contacting, intimidating, threatening or otherwise interfering with the victim of the alleged offense and any other persons, including but not limited to members of the family or household of the victim, as the court may describe in the order. Prohibited contact under this paragraph includes telephone calls, mail, e-mail, texting, fax, contacting through social media using the internet or similar technology and any other form of communication.</p>
                  <p>(b) The order shall contain a notice that willful violation of any provision of the order constitutes a crime as defined by W.S. 7-3-510(c) and can result in immediate arrest. The order shall also state that a violation that constitutes the offense of stalking as defined by W.S. 6-2-506(b) may subject the perpetrator to enhanced penalties for felony stalking under W.S. 6-2-506(e).</p>
                  <p>(c) A request by the victim for the perpetrator to violate an order of protection issued under this section or a temporary order of protection issued under W.S. 7-3-508 shall constitute an affirmative defense to a charge of violation of the order by the perpetrator.</p>

                  <p>(a) An order of protection granted under W.S. 7-3-509 shall be served upon the respondent pursuant to the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure. A copy of the order of protection shall be filed with the sheriff of the county.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, an order of protection granted by the court under W.S. 7-3-509 shall be effective for a fixed period of time not to exceed three (3) years. Either party may move to modify, terminate or extend the order. The order may be extended repetitively upon a showing of good cause for additional periods of time, not to exceed three (3) years each, if the court finds from specific facts that a clear and present danger to the victim continues to exist. If a party subject to an order of protection is sentenced and incarcerated or becomes imprisoned, the running of the time remaining for the order of protection shall be tolled during the term of incarceration or imprisonment. The conditions and provisions of an order of protection shall remain in effect during any period of tolling under this subsection. Upon release from incarceration or imprisonment the effective period of the order of protection shall be the amount of time remaining as of the first day of the term of incarceration or imprisonment or one (1) year from the date of release, whichever is greater.</p>

                  <p>(iv) A statement of the required duration of the interception. If the nature of the investigation will require that the interception not automatically terminate when the described type of communication has been first obtained, the application shall state a particular description of facts sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that additional communications of the same type will occur after the initial interception;</p>
                  <p>(v) A full and complete statement by the applicant concerning all previous applications known to the individual authorizing and making the application to have been made to any judge:</p>

                  <p>(iii) Normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed or would be too dangerous;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as provided in subsection (u) of this section, there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where, the wire, oral or electronic communications are to be intercepted is or is about to be used in connection with any of the offenses enumerated in W.S. 7-3-705 or is leased to, listed in the name of or used by the person suspected in the commission of any enumerated offense.</p>

                  <p>(iv) The period of time during which an interception is authorized including a statement as to whether or not the interception shall automatically terminate when the described communication is first obtained;</p>
                  <p>(v) The identity of the agency authorized to intercept the communications and of the person authorizing the application.</p>
                  <p>(e) No order entered under this section may authorize the interception of any wire, oral or electronic communication for any period longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization, or in any event no longer than thirty (30) days unless extended under subsection (f) of this section. The thirty (30) day period provided by this subsection begins on the earlier of the day on which the peace officer first begins to conduct an interception under the order or ten (10) days after the order is entered.</p>
                  <p>(f) Extensions of an order may be granted upon an application for extension made in accordance with subsection (a) of this section and upon the findings required by subsection (c) of this section. The period of the extension shall be no longer than the authorizing judge deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was granted and in any event no longer than thirty (30) days.</p>
                  <p>(g) Every order and extension thereof shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon as practicable, and that the execution of the permission shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this act. Every order or extension thereof shall also provide that the interception terminate upon attainment of the objective, or in any event in thirty (30) days.</p>
                  <p>(h) Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to this act, the order may require reports to be made to the judge issuing the order, stating the progress which has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception. The reports shall be made at intervals as the judge may require.</p>
                  <p>(j) The contents of any wire, oral or electronic communication intercepted shall, if possible, be recorded on tape, electronic, wire, computer storage media or other comparable device. The recording shall be performed to protect it from editing or other alterations. Immediately upon expiration of the period of the order, or extension thereof, the recording shall be submitted to the judge issuing the order and shall be sealed under his directions. Custody of the recordings shall be wherever the judge orders. A recording shall not be destroyed except upon an order of the judge, and in any event shall be kept for ten (10) years. Duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of this section. The presence of the seal provided for by this subsection, or a satisfactory explanation for its absence, is a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom.</p>
                  <p>(k) Applications made and orders granted under this act shall be sealed by the judge. Custody of the sealed applications and orders shall be maintained at the direction of the judge. The applications and orders shall be disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a judge and shall not be destroyed except upon order of the judge to whom the application was presented, and in any event shall be kept for ten (10) years. Any information obtained pursuant to a court order permitting interception of wire, oral or electronic communications shall not be used, published or divulged except in accordance with the provisions of this act. Any violations of the provisions of this subsection or subsection (j) of this section may be punished as contempt of the issuing or denying judge.</p>
                  <p>(m) Within a reasonable time, but not later than ninety (90) days after the denial of an application or the termination of the period of an order authorizing interception or extension thereof, the judge shall cause to be served upon each person named in the order or application and any other person the judge determines as in the interest of justice, notice of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) That an order or application has been entered under this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The date of the entry and the period of permitted interception or the denial of the application; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether wire, oral or electronic communications were or were not intercepted.</p>
                  <p>(n) The judge, upon the filing of a motion, may, in his discretion, make available to the person or his counsel for inspection any portion of the intercepted communications, applications and orders as the judge determines to be in the interest of justice. On an ex parte showing of good cause to a judge of competent jurisdiction, the service of the matter required by subsection (m) of this section may be postponed.</p>
                  <p>(o) The contents of any wire, oral or electronic communication intercepted pursuant to this section or evidence derived from that communication shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing or other proceeding unless the party offering the evidence, not less than twenty (20) days before the trial, hearing or proceeding, gives notice to the court or hearing officer and all other parties. The court may then order disclosure of the court order and accompanying application. If the order of interception and accompanying application has previously been disclosed, the offering party may furnish all other parties with the order of interception and accompanying application without further order of the court or hearing officer upon proper notice. This twenty (20) day period may be waived by the court or hearing officer if it finds that it was not possible to furnish the party with the information twenty (20) days before the trial, hearing or proceeding and that no party will be prejudiced by the delay in receiving the information.</p>
                  <p>(p) The contents of any intercepted wire, oral or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom shall not be admitted as evidence in any trial, hearing or other proceeding in this state unless the interception was performed in accordance with this act.</p>
                  <p>(q) No otherwise privileged wire, oral or electronic communication intercepted in accordance with or in violation of this act shall lose its privileged character, unless the communications are in furtherance of a criminal act in violation of the laws of the United States or this state.</p>
                  <p>(r) When a peace officer, while engaged in intercepting wire, oral or electronic communications relating to an offense specified in the order permitting interception, intercepts wire, oral or electronic communications relating to an offense other than those specified in the order, the contents thereof, and evidence derived therefrom, may be disclosed or used only if the offense constitutes a felony under the laws of the United States or this state. If the communication concerns an enumerated offense listed in W.S. 7-3-705, the agency executing the order of interception shall apply to the issuing court for an expansion of the order of interception pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) of this section. The application shall be made as soon as practicable.</p>
                  <p>(s) In the event an intercepted communication is in a code or a foreign language, and an expert in that code or foreign language is not reasonably available during the interception period, any minimization required under this section shall be accomplished as soon as practicable after the interception.</p>
                  <p>(t) The requirements of subparagraph (a)(ii)(B) and paragraph (c)(iv) of this section relating to the specification of the facilities from which, or the place where, the communication is to be intercepted do not apply if:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of an application with respect to the interception of an oral communication:</p>
                  <p>(A) The application contains a full and complete statement as to why such specification is not practical and identifies the person committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The judge finds that such specification is not practical.</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of an application with respect to a wire or electronic communication:</p>
                  <p>(A) The application identifies the person believed to be committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted and the applicant makes a showing that there is probable cause to believe that the person's actions could have the effect of thwarting interception from a specified facility;</p>
                  <p>(B) The judge finds that such showing has been adequately made; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The order authorizing the interception is limited to interception only for such time as it is reasonable to presume that the person identified in the application is or was reasonably proximate to the instrument through which such communication will be or was transmitted.</p>
                  <p>(u) An interception of a communication under an order with respect to which the requirements of subparagraph (a)(ii)(B) and paragraph (c)(iv) of this section do not apply by reason of paragraph (t)(i) of this section shall not begin until the place where the communication is to be intercepted is ascertained by the person implementing the interception order. A provider of wire or electronic communications service that has received an order as provided for in paragraph (t)(ii) of this section may move the court to modify or quash the order on the ground that its assistance with respect to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable fashion. The court, upon notice to the prosecuting authority, shall decide such a motion expeditiously.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>7-4-106. Archaeological human burial sites.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The county coroner shall have jurisdiction over all archaeological human burials discovered in the county on state or private lands.</p>
                  <p>(b) When human remains are discovered:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person who discovers the remains shall cease the activity that caused the discovery of the remains and immediately notify law enforcement. If the remains are discovered on private land and the person who discovers the remains is not an agent of the landowner, the individual shall also notify the landowner;</p>
                  <p>(ii) When law enforcement is notified that human remains have been discovered within the limits of the county, law enforcement shall notify the coroner who shall determine the approximate age of the burial site. If the human remains constitute an archaeological human burial:</p>
                  <p>(A) On private land, the coroner shall notify the state archaeologist and the landowner;</p>
                  <p>(B) On state land, the coroner shall notify the state archaeologist and the office of state lands and investments. The office of state lands and investments shall notify any leaseholder;</p>
                  <p>(C) The state archaeologist's investigation to determine the forensic value and archaeological context shall be:</p>
                  <p>(I) Commenced within two (2) business days of the discovery to protect the integrity of the remains;</p>
                  <p>(II) Limited to the discovered human burial site.</p>
                  <p>(c) When human remains are exhumed:</p>
                  <p>(i) An archaeological human burial shall only be exhumed under the direction and supervision of the state archaeologist in coordination with the county coroner, and provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) The coroner shall notify the landowner of exhumation; and</p>
                  <p>(B) If the state archaeologist determines that the remains are Native American, the state archaeologist shall notify the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes before exhumation.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Absent extraordinary circumstances, exhumation shall be completed not more than six (6) business days from the date the coroner notifies the state archaeologist of the archeological human burial discovery to protect the safety and integrity of the remains.</p>
                  <p>(d) When human remains are reinterred:</p>
                  <p>(i) When the state archaeologist determines that an archaeological human burial is Native American, after archaeological human remains are exhumed and before reinterment or repatriation, the state archaeologist and county coroner shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) Notify and consult with culturally affiliated Native American tribes in accordance with the protocol developed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Expend reasonable effort to identify present day descendants.</p>
                  <p>(ii) When the state archaeologist determines that an archaeological human burial is not Native American, the state archaeologist shall expend reasonable effort to identify present day descendants and consult with them before reinterment;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If no descendants of the person whose remains were exhumed are identifiable, remains may be reinterred on state lands;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Subject to the notification of law enforcement, the coroner and the state archaeologist and the procedures in this section, nothing in this section precludes a landowner from working with descendants or Native American tribes to reinter human remains on private lands with the landowner's consent.</p>
                  <p>(e) Human remains shall be treated with respect, dignity and with consideration of religious, spiritual and ethnic evidence present at the burial site.</p>
                  <p>(f) The state archaeologist in cooperation with the state historic preservation office and county coroners shall work with culturally affiliated tribes including the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes to develop a protocol for consultation, repatriation and reinterment or other disposition of Native American human remains.</p>
                  <p>(g) For purposes of this section, "archaeological human burial" includes human remains and funerary objects that, as part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, are reasonably believed to have been placed with individual human remains at the time of death or later but does not include remains found in known or marked graves, found in established cemeteries or that demonstrate present medicolegal significance.</p>
                  <p>(h) A person who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), or both.</p>

                  <p>(i) An examination of the body and an investigation into the medical history of the case;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The appointment of a qualified physician to assist in determining the cause of death;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An autopsy if the physician appointed to assist the coroner under this subsection determines an autopsy is necessary;</p>

                  <p>(e) The expense and costs of conducting the investigation or holding the inquest shall be paid by the county in which the injuries were received. The accounts of the claimants shall be attested by the coroner or acting coroner, and shall be presented in duplicate to the board of county commissioners of the proper county.

                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the coroner may inspect medical and psychological data relating to the person whose death is being investigated if the coroner determines the information is relevant and necessary to the investigation.</p>

The district judge may, for good cause shown, order the impaneling of a state grand jury which shall have statewide jurisdiction.

A state grand jury shall be composed of twelve (12) persons, but not more than one-half (1/2) of the members of the state grand jury shall be residents of any one (1) county. The members of the state grand jury shall be selected by the court in the same manner as jurors of county grand juries and shall serve for one (1) year following selection unless discharged sooner by the district judge.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to its powers of indictment, a statewide grand jury impaneled under W.S. 7-5-301 through 7-5-309 may, at the request of the attorney general, cause an investigation to be made into the extent of organized criminal activity within the state and return a report to the attorney general.</p>
                  <p>(b) Disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury, other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror, may be made to the attorney general and to any district attorney for use in the performance of their duties. Those officials may disclose so much of the grand jury's proceedings to law enforcement agencies as they deem essential to the public interest and effective law enforcement.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, operator of a recording device or any typist who transcribes recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that a particularized need exists for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury.</p>
                  <p>(d) No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon any person except in accordance with this section. The court may direct that an indictment shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has given bail, and in that event, the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person shall disclose the finding of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>7-6-106. Determination of need; reimbursement for services.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The determination of whether a person covered by W.S. 7-6-104 is a needy person shall be deferred until his first appearance in court or in a suit for payment or reimbursement under W.S. 7-6-108, whichever occurs earlier. Thereafter, the court shall determine, with respect to each proceeding, whether he is a needy person. For purposes of this section, an appeal, probation revocation or proceeding to correct or modify a sentence is a separate proceeding. The determination of need shall be based on a separate application submitted at the time of each proceeding.</p>
                <p>(b) In determining whether a person is a needy person and in determining the extent of his inability to pay, and, in the case of an unemancipated minor, the inability to pay of his custodial parent or another person who has a legal obligation of support, the court shall consider the standards set forth in subsections (f) through (h) of this section and Rule 44(d), Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure. Release on bail does not necessarily prevent a person from being determined to be needy. In each case the person, subject to the penalties for perjury, shall certify in writing, or by other record, the material factors relating to his ability to pay as the court prescribes.</p>
                <p>(c) In every case in which a person has received services under W.S. 7-6-104, the presiding judge shall determine whether the person or, in the case of an unemancipated minor, his custodial parent or any other person who has a legal obligation of support, is able to provide any funds towards payment of part or all of the cost associated with such services. If the person or, in the case of an unemancipated minor, his custodial parent or any other person who has a legal obligation of support, is not able to provide any funds towards payment of costs, the court shall enter a specific finding on the record. If the court determines the person or, in the case of an unemancipated minor, his custodial parent or any other person who has a legal obligation of support, is able to provide any amount as reimbursement, the court shall order the person or, in the case of an unemancipated minor, his custodial parent or any other person who has a legal obligation of support, to reimburse the state for all or part of the costs of the services provided or shall state on the record the reasons why an order for reimbursement was not entered. Where a person is initially provided with counsel pursuant to W.S. 7-6-105(a), but subsequently retains private counsel, the court may order the person to reimburse the state for the services already provided. All reimbursements under this act shall be made through the clerk of court.</p>
                <p>(d) The state public defender shall report in the agency's annual report concerning:</p>
                <p>(i) The number of cases by court in which an attorney was appointed to represent a person at public expense under this act during the preceding calendar quarter;</p>
                <p>(ii) For each case in which an attorney was appointed, whether the court ordered reimbursement under this section or, if reimbursement was not ordered, whether the court complied with subsection (c) of this section;</p>
                <p>(iii) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 122, § 3.</p>
                <p>(e) If the court orders release on bail pending trial or appeal, probation before sentence, suspended sentence or probation, the court shall order the needy person as a condition of bail, sentence or probation to repay the state for expenses and services provided by appointed attorneys pursuant to the state public defender's standard fee schedule if the court determines the defendant has an ability to pay or that a reasonable probability exists that the defendant will have an ability to pay.</p>
                <p>(f) The following income standards shall be used to determine whether a person is needy for purposes of this article:</p>
                <p>(i) A person whose annual gross income is less than one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the current federally established poverty level for his immediate family unit is needy;</p>
                <p>(ii) A person whose annual gross income is between one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) and two hundred eighteen percent (218%) of the current federally established poverty level for his immediate family unit may be deemed needy;</p>
                <p>(iii) A person whose annual gross income is greater than two hundred eighteen percent (218%) of the current federally established poverty level for his immediate family unit shall not be deemed needy under this article.</p>
                <p>(g) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, a person may be deemed needy if the person is charged with a felony and the court, in its discretion, determines on the record after consideration of the standards set forth in Rule 44(d), Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure that extraordinary circumstances exist such that the person is entitled to representation.</p>
                <p>(h) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, a person shall be presumed needy if:</p>
                <p>(i) He receives at least one (1) of the following types of public assistance:</p>
                <p>(A) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF);</p>
                <p>(B) Emergency Aid to Elderly, Disabled and Children (EAEDC);</p>
                <p>(C) Poverty related veteran's benefits;</p>

                <p>(a) Nothing in this act shall prevent a court on its own motion or upon application by the state public defender or by the individual defendant, from appointing an attorney other than the public defender to represent the defendant or to assist in the representation of the defendant at any stage of the proceedings or on appeal.</p>
                <p>(b) If a court assigns an attorney to represent a needy person, it may recommend a reasonable rate of compensation for his services and shall determine the direct expenses for which he should be reimbursed. The state public defender shall consider the court's recommendation and the customary compensation as prescribed by the standard fee schedule promulgated pursuant to W.S. 7-6-103(c)(vi), and shall pay the appointed attorney for his services when the case for which he was appointed is concluded.</p>
                <p>(c) An attorney appointed under subsection (b) of this section shall be compensated for his services with regard to the complexity of the issues, the time involved, prevailing local fees of attorneys, the amount reasonably necessary to provide a defense as is required by constitutional process and other relevant considerations as determined by the court.</p>
                <p>(d) If a defendant initially retains counsel and then requests the provision of counsel or any other defense services, including but not limited to mental evaluations, expert witnesses and witness travel expenses, the court shall make a determination whether the defendant is a "needy person" under this act, subject to the following:</p>
                <p>(i) The procedures set forth in W.S. 7-6-106 shall be followed;</p>
                <p>(ii) The court shall make the findings required by W.S. 7-6-106 and rule 44 of the Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure;</p>
                <p>(iii) The defendant shall complete an affidavit or otherwise disclose on the record his entire financial situation, including the amount he has already paid to retain defense counsel, the source of those funds and whether additional funds are available to him through any means;</p>
                <p>(iv) The defendant shall disclose the disposition of any retainer and any amounts remaining; and</p>
                <p>(v) The state public defender shall be served by the defendant's retained counsel with a copy of any such request and shall be heard by the court prior to any decision on the request.</p>

                <p>(a) As used in this chapter:</p>
                <p>(i) "Criminal activity" means any crime for which there is a plea of guilty, nolo contendere or verdict of guilty upon which a judgment of conviction may be rendered and includes any other crime which is admitted by the defendant, whether or not prosecuted. In the case of restitution ordered under W.S. 7-13-301, "criminal activity" also includes a crime charged against the defendant;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Long-term physical health care restitution order" means an order entered pursuant to W.S. 7-9-113 through 7-9-115;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Pecuniary damage" means all damages which a victim could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the same facts or event, including damages for wrongful death. It does not include punitive damages and damages for pain, suffering, mental anguish and loss of consortium;</p>
                <p>(iv) "Restitution" means full or partial payment of pecuniary damage to a victim;</p>
                <p>(v) "Victim" means a person who has suffered pecuniary damage as a result of a defendant's criminal activities. An insurer which paid any part of a victim's pecuniary damages shall be regarded as the victim only if the insurer has no right of subrogation and the insured has no duty to pay the proceeds of restitution to the insurer.</p>

                <p>In addition to any other punishment prescribed by law the court shall, upon conviction for any misdemeanor or felony, order a defendant to pay restitution to each victim as determined under W.S. 7-9-103 and 7-9-114 unless the court specifically finds that the defendant has no ability to pay and that no reasonable probability exists that the defendant will have an ability to pay.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>7-9-103. Determination of amount owed; execution.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) As part of the sentencing process including deferred prosecutions under W.S. 7-13-301, in any misdemeanor or felony case, the prosecuting attorney shall present to the court any claim for restitution submitted by any victim.</p>
                <p>(b) In every case in which a claim for restitution is submitted, the court shall fix a reasonable amount as restitution owed to each victim for actual pecuniary damage resulting from the defendant's criminal activity, and shall include its determination of the pecuniary damage as a special finding in the judgment of conviction or in the order placing the defendant on probation under W.S. 7-13-301. In determining the amount of restitution, the court shall consider and include as a special finding, each victim's reasonably foreseeable actual pecuniary damage that will result in the future as a result of the defendant's criminal activity. A long-term physical health care restitution order shall be entered as provided in W.S. 7-9-113 through 7-9-115.</p>
                <p>(c) The court shall order the defendant to pay all or part of the restitution claimed or shall state on the record specific reasons why an order for restitution was not entered. If the court determines that the defendant has no ability to pay and that no reasonable probability exists that the defendant will have an ability to pay in the future, the court shall enter specific findings in the record supporting its determination.</p>
                <p>(d) Any order for restitution under this chapter constitutes a judgment by operation of law on the date it is entered. To satisfy the judgment, the clerk, upon request of the victim, the division of victim services or the district attorney, shall issue execution in the same manner as in a civil action.</p>
                <p>(e) The court's determination of the amount of restitution owed under this section is not admissible as evidence in any civil action.</p>
                <p>(f) The defendant shall be given credit against his restitution obligation for payments made to the victim by the defendant's insurer for injuries arising out of the same facts or event.</p>

                <p>(a) In any case in which the court has ordered restitution under W.S. 7-9-102, 7-9-113 or 7-13-301, if the sentencing court orders suspended imposition of sentence, suspended sentence or probation, the court shall require that the defendant in cooperation with the probation and parole officer assigned to the defendant, or in the case of unsupervised probation any probation and parole officer or any other person the court directs, promptly prepare a plan of restitution including the name and address of each victim, the amount of restitution determined to be owed to each victim pursuant to W.S. 7-9-103 or 7-9-114 and a schedule of restitution payments. If the defendant is presently unable to make any restitution but there is a reasonable possibility that the defendant may be able to do so at some time during his probation period, the plan of restitution shall also state the conditions under which or the event after which the defendant shall make restitution. In structuring a plan for reimbursement under this section, victim restitution shall be paid in the following order:</p>
                <p>(i) Pecuniary damages suffered by the victim which have not been paid by insurance or from the crime victim's compensation account;</p>
                <p>(ii) Payment of other amounts owed by the defendant arising from the case.</p>

The court shall promptly enter an order approving the plan or modifying it and providing for restitution payments to the extent that the defendant is or may become reasonably able to make restitution, taking into account the factors enumerated in W.S. 7-9-106. The court may modify the plan at any time upon the defendant's request, upon the court's own motion and, for those cases within the provisions of W.S. 7-9-113 through 7-9-115, upon the motion of the victim.</p>

                <p>(a) Compliance with the plan of restitution as approved or modified by the court shall be a condition of the defendant's probation or suspension.</p>
                <p>(b) Restitution payments by the defendant shall be made payable to the office of the clerk in a form acceptable to the clerk.</p>

                <p>Failure of the defendant to comply with W.S. 7-9-104 or to comply with the plan of restitution as approved or modified by the court is a violation of the conditions of probation.

                <p>Criminal contempt under this section is punishable by imprisonment for not more than one (1) year. The court may modify the plan of restitution or extend the period of time for restitution, but, except for those cases falling within the provisions of W.S. 7-9-113 through 7-9-115, the court may not extend the period of time for restitution beyond ten (10) years following the date of the defendant's discharge from sentence or expiration of probation under W.S. 7-13-301.</p>

                <p>(a) In addition to any other punishment prescribed by law and any restitution ordered pursuant to W.S. 7-9-102 which did not include long-term physical health care costs, the court may, upon conviction of any misdemeanor or felony, order a defendant to pay restitution to a victim in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 7-9-114 if the victim has suffered physical injury as a result of the crime which is reasonably probable to require or has required long-term physical health care for more than three (3) months.</p>
                <p>(b) As used in W.S. 7-9-113 through 7-9-115 "long-term physical health care" includes mental health care.</p>

                <p>(a) In determining the amount of restitution to be ordered for long-term physical health care, the court shall consider the factors stated in W.S. 7-9-106 together with an estimated monthly cost of long-term physical health care of the victim provided by the victim or his representative. The victim's estimate of long-term physical health care costs may be made as part of a victim impact statement under W.S. 7-21-103 or made separately. The court shall enter the long-term physical health care restitution order at the time of sentencing. An order of restitution made pursuant to this section shall fix a monthly amount to be paid by the defendant for as long as long-term physical health care of the victim is required as a result of the crime. The order may exceed the length of any sentence imposed upon the defendant for the criminal activity. The court shall include as a special finding in the judgment of conviction its determination of the monthly cost of long-term physical health care.</p>
                <p>(b) Restitution ordered under this section shall be paid as provided in W.S. 7-9-108. The restitution order shall be a civil judgment against the defendant and may be enforced by any means provided for enforcing other restitution orders and civil judgments.</p>

                  <p>(ii) That he has formed or expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, or is biased or prejudiced for or against the accused;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In a case in which the death penalty may be imposed, he states that his views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his oath or affirmation and the instructions of the court;</p>

                  <p>(i) The counsel for the state shall state the case of the prosecution, and may briefly state the evidence by which he expects to sustain it;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The defendant or his counsel may then state his defense and may briefly state the evidence he expects to offer in support of it, or may wait until the evidence on the part of the state is closed;</p>

                  <p>(iv) The state will then be confined to rebutting evidence unless the court, for good reasons, in furtherance of justice, shall permit it to offer evidence in chief;</p>
                  <p>(v) When the evidence is concluded, either party may request instructions to the jury on the points of law, which shall be given or refused by the court. The instructions shall be reduced to writing;</p>

The order may include, but is not limited to, an examination of the accused at the Wyoming state hospital on an inpatient or outpatient basis, at a local mental health center on an inpatient or outpatient basis, or at his place of detention. In selecting the examination site, the court may consider proximity to the court, availability of an examiner, and the necessity for security precautions. If the order provides for commitment of the accused to a designated facility, the commitment shall continue no longer than a thirty (30) day period for the study of the mental condition of the accused.</p>
                  <p>The prosecuting attorney and counsel for the accused shall cooperate in providing the relevant information and materials to the designated examiner, and the court may order as necessary that relevant information be provided to the examiner.</p>
                  <p>(c) Written reports of the examination shall be filed with the clerk of court. The report shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) Detailed findings;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An opinion as to whether the accused has a mental illness or deficiency, and its probable duration;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An opinion as to whether the accused, as a result of mental illness or deficiency, lacks capacity to comprehend his position, to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to conduct his defense in a rational manner, and to cooperate with his counsel to the end that any available defense may be interposed;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 31, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(v) A recommendation as to whether the accused should be held in a designated facility for treatment pending determination by the court of the issue of mental fitness to proceed; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) A recommendation as to whether the accused, if found by the court to be mentally fit to proceed, should be detained in a designated facility pending further proceedings.</p>
                  <p>(d) The clerk of court shall deliver copies of the report to the district attorney and to the accused or his counsel. The report is not a public record or open to the public. After receiving a copy of the report, both the accused and the state may, upon written request and for good cause shown, obtain an order granting them an examination of the accused by a designated examiner of their own choosing. For each examination ordered, a report conforming to the requirements of subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section shall be furnished to the court and the opposing party.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the initial report contains the recommendation that the accused should be held in a designated facility pending determination of the issue of mental fitness to proceed, the court may order that the accused be committed to or held in a designated facility pending determination of mental fitness to proceed. The court may order the involuntary administration of antipsychotic medications to a person accused of a serious crime as defined in W.S. 7-6-102(a)(v) to render the accused competent to stand trial, provided the court finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) There are important governmental interests at stake including, but not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Bringing the accused to trial;</p>
                  <p>(B) Timely prosecution;</p>
                  <p>(C) Assuring the accused has a fair trial.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The involuntary administration of antipsychotic medications will significantly further the governmental interest and the administration of the medication is:</p>
                  <p>(A) Substantially likely to render the accused competent to stand trial; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the ability of the accused to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense, thereby rendering the trial unfair.</p>
                  <p>(iii) That any alternative and less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The administration pursuant to a prescription by a licensed psychiatrist of the antipsychotic medications is medically appropriate and is in the best medical interests of the accused in light of the accused's medical condition.</p>
                  <p>(f) If neither the state, nor the accused or his counsel contests the opinion referred to in paragraph (c)(iii) of this section relative to fitness to proceed, the court may make a determination and finding of record on this issue on the basis of the report filed or the court may hold a hearing on its own motion. If the opinion relative to fitness to proceed is contested the court shall hold a hearing on the issue. The report or reports may be received in evidence at any hearing on the issue. The party contesting any opinion relative to fitness to proceed has the right to summon and cross-examine the persons who rendered the opinion and to offer evidence upon the issue.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the court determines that the accused is mentally fit to proceed, the court may order that the accused be held in confinement, be committed to a designated facility pending further proceedings, or be released on bail or other conditions. If the court determines that the accused lacks mental fitness to proceed, the proceedings against him shall be suspended and the court shall commit him to a designated facility to determine whether there is substantial probability that the accused will regain his fitness to proceed:</p>
                  <p>(i) The examiner shall provide a full report to the court, the prosecuting attorney and the accused or his counsel within ninety (90) days of arrival of the accused at the designated treating facility. If the examiner is unable to complete the assessment within ninety (90) days the examiner shall provide to the court and counsel a summary progress report which informs the court that additional time is necessary to complete the assessment, in which case the examiner may have up to an additional ninety (90) days to provide the full report for good cause shown, as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) The full report shall assess:</p>
                  <p>(I) The facility's or program's capacity to provide appropriate treatment for the accused;</p>
                  <p>(II) The nature of treatments provided to the accused;</p>
                  <p>(III) What progress toward competency restoration has been made with respect to the factors identified by the court in its initial order;</p>
                  <p>(IV) The accused's current level of mental disorder or mental deficiency and need for treatment, if any; and</p>
                  <p>(V) The likelihood of restoration of competency and the amount of time estimated to achieve competency.</p>
                  <p>(B) Upon receipt of the full report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the accused's current status. The burden of proving that the accused is fit to proceed shall be on the proponent of the assertion. Following the hearing, the court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the accused is:</p>
                  <p>(I) Fit to proceed;</p>
                  <p>(II) Not fit to proceed with a substantial probability that the accused may become fit to proceed in the foreseeable future; or</p>
                  <p>(III) Not fit to proceed without a substantial probability that the accused may become fit to proceed in the foreseeable future.</p>
                  <p>(C) If the court makes a determination pursuant to subdivision (B)(I) of this paragraph, the court shall proceed with the trial or any other procedures as may be necessary to adjudicate the charges;</p>
                  <p>(D) If the court makes a determination pursuant to subdivision (B)(II) of this paragraph, the court may order that the accused remain committed to the custody of the designated facility for the purpose of treatment intended to restore the accused to competency;</p>
                  <p>(E) If the court makes a determination pursuant to subdivision (B)(III) of this paragraph, the court shall order the accused released from the custody of the designated facility unless proper civil commitment proceedings have been instituted and held as provided in title 25 of the Wyoming statutes. The continued retention, hospitalization and discharge of the accused shall be the same as for other patients.</p>
                  <p>(ii) If it is determined pursuant to subdivision (i)(B)(II) of this subsection that there is substantial probability that the accused will regain his fitness to proceed, the commitment of the accused at a designated facility shall continue until the head of the facility reports to the court that in his opinion the accused is fit to proceed. If this opinion is not contested by the state, the accused or his counsel, the criminal proceeding shall be resumed. If the opinion is contested, the court shall hold a hearing as provided in subsection (f) of this section. While the accused remains at a designated facility under this subsection, the head of the facility shall issue a full report at least once every three (3) months in accordance with the requirements of subparagraph (i)(A) of this subsection on the progress the accused is making towards regaining his fitness to proceed.</p>
                  <p>(h) A finding by the court that the accused is mentally fit to proceed shall not prejudice the accused in a defense to the crime charged on the ground that at the time of the act he was afflicted with a mental illness or deficiency excluding responsibility. Nor shall the finding be introduced in evidence on that issue or otherwise brought to the notice of the jury. No statement made by the accused in the course of any examination or treatment pursuant to this section and no information received by any person in the course of the examination or treatment shall be admitted in evidence in any criminal proceeding then or thereafter pending on any issue other than that of the mental condition of the accused.</p>
                  <p>(j) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, counsel for the accused may make any and all legal objections which are susceptible of a fair determination prior to trial without the personal participation of the accused.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>7-11-304. Responsibility for criminal conduct; plea; examination; commitment; use of statements by defendant.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of the criminal conduct, as a result of mental illness or deficiency, he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. As used in this section, the terms mental illness or deficiency mean only those severely abnormal mental conditions that grossly and demonstrably impair a person's perception or understanding of reality and that are not attributable primarily to self-induced intoxication as defined by W.S. 6-1-202(b).</p>
                  <p>(b) As used in this section, the terms "mental illness or deficiency" do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.</p>
                  <p>(c) Evidence that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct by reason of mental illness or deficiency is not admissible at the trial of the defendant unless a plea of "not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency" is made. A plea of "not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency" may be pleaded orally or in writing by the defendant or his counsel at the time of his arraignment. The court, for good cause shown, may also allow that plea to be entered at a later time. Such a plea does not deprive the defendant of other defenses.</p>
                  <p>(d) In all cases where a plea of "not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency" is made, the court shall order an examination of the defendant by a designated examiner. The order may include, but is not limited to, an examination of the defendant at the Wyoming state hospital on an inpatient or outpatient basis, at a local mental health center on an inpatient or outpatient basis, or at his place of detention. In selecting the examination site, the court may consider proximity to the court, availability of an examiner and the necessity for security precautions. If the order provides for commitment of the defendant to a designated facility, the commitment shall continue no longer than a forty-five (45) day period for the observation and evaluation of the mental condition of the defendant, which time may be extended by the approval of the court.</p>
                  <p>(e) If an examination of a defendant's fitness to proceed has been ordered pursuant to W.S. 7-11-303, an examination following a plea of "not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency" shall not occur, or be ordered, until the court has found the defendant is competent to proceed under W.S. 7-11-303.</p>
                  <p>(f) A written report of the examination shall be filed with the clerk of court. The report shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) Detailed findings, including, but not limited to, the data and reasoning that link the opinions specified in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An opinion as to whether the defendant has a mental illness or deficiency;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An opinion as to whether at the time of the alleged criminal conduct the defendant, as a result of mental illness or deficiency, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>
                  <p>(g) The clerk of court shall deliver copies of the report to the district attorney and to the defendant or his counsel. The report shall not be a public record or open to the public. If an examination provided under subsection (d) of this section was conducted, the report may be received in evidence and no new examination shall be required unless requested under this subsection. Within five (5) days after receiving a copy of the report, the defendant or the state, upon written request, may obtain an order granting an examination of the defendant by a designated examiner chosen by the requester of the examination.</p>
                  <p>(h) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no statement made by the defendant in the course of any examination or treatment pursuant to this section and no information received by any person in the course thereof is admissible in evidence in any criminal proceeding on any issue other than that of the mental condition of the defendant. If the defendant testifies in his own behalf, any statement made by him in the course of any examination or treatment pursuant to this section may be admitted:</p>
                  <p>(i) For impeachment purposes; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) As evidence in a criminal prosecution for perjury.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>7-11-305. Pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency; burden of proof; expert witnesses.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) When a defendant couples a plea of not guilty with a plea of not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency, proof shall be submitted before the same jury in a continuous trial on whether the defendant in fact committed the acts charged, on the remaining elements of the alleged criminal offense and on the issue of mental responsibility of the defendant. In addition to other forms of verdict submitted to the jury, the court shall submit a verdict by which the jury may find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency excluding responsibility.</p>
                  <p>(b) The prosecution shall prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the offense charged. Every defendant is presumed to be mentally responsible. The defendant shall have the burden of going forward and proving by the greater weight of evidence that, as a result of mental illness or deficiency, he lacked capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>
                  <p>(c) Only the designated examiners who examined the defendant pursuant to W.S. 7-11-303 or 7-11-304 are competent witnesses to testify as to the defendant's mental responsibility.</p>
                  <p>(d) In addition, the state and the defendant may summon other expert witnesses who did not examine the defendant. Such experts are not competent to testify as to the mental responsibility of the defendant; however, they may testify as to the validity of the procedures followed and the general scientific propositions stated by other witnesses.</p>
                  <p>(e) The designated examiner who examined the defendant may testify as to and explain the nature of his examinations, his diagnosis of mental illness or deficiency of the defendant, and his opinion as to the defendant's ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. The designated examiner may be cross-examined as to his competence and the credibility of his diagnosis and his opinion.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>7-11-306. Disposition of persons found not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency excluding responsibility.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) After entry of a judgment of not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency excluding responsibility, the court shall, on the basis of evidence given at trial or at a separate hearing, make an order as provided in subsection (b), (c) or (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the court finds that the person is no longer affected by mental illness or deficiency, or that he no longer presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others and is not in need of care, supervision or treatment, the court shall order him discharged from custody.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the court finds that the person is affected by mental illness or deficiency and presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others, but can be controlled adequately and given proper care, supervision and treatment if released on supervision, the court shall order him released subject to the supervisory orders of the court as are appropriate in the interests of justice and the welfare of the defendant. The court may appoint any person or state, county or local agency which the court considers capable of supervising the person upon release. Upon receipt of an order issued under this subsection, the person or agency appointed shall assume the supervision of the person pursuant to the direction of the court. Conditions of release in the order of the court may be modified from time to time and supervision may be terminated by order of the court. If upon a hearing the state shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the person released on supervision under this subsection can no longer be controlled adequately by supervision, the court may order the person committed to the Wyoming state hospital or other designated facility for custody, care and treatment.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the court finds that the person is affected by mental illness or deficiency and presents substantial risk of danger to himself or others and that he is not a proper subject for release or supervision, the court shall order him committed to the Wyoming state hospital or other designated facility for custody, care and treatment.</p>
                  <p>(e) Following the first ninety (90) days of commitment to the Wyoming state hospital or other designated facility under this section, if at any time the head of the facility is of the opinion that the person is no longer affected by mental illness or deficiency, or that he no longer presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others, the head of the facility shall apply to the court which committed the person for an order of discharge. The application shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the facts supporting the opinion of the head of the facility. Copies of the application and report shall be transmitted by the clerk of the court to the district attorney. The court shall hold a hearing on this matter as soon as possible. If the state opposes the recommendation of the head of the facility, the state has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to show that the person continues to be affected by mental illness or deficiency and continues to present a substantial risk of danger to himself or others and should remain in the custody of the designated facility.</p>
                  <p>(f) Ninety (90) days after the order of commitment, any person committed to the designated facility under this section may apply to the district court of the county from which he was committed for an order of discharge upon the grounds that he is no longer affected by mental illness or deficiency, or that he no longer presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others. The application for discharge shall be accompanied by a report of the head of the facility which shall be prepared and transmitted as provided in subsection (e) of this section. The court shall hold a hearing on this matter as soon as possible. The applicant shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence his fitness for discharge. An application for an order of discharge under this subsection filed within six (6) months of the date of a previous hearing shall be subject to summary disposition by the court.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the court, after a hearing upon any application for discharge, or application for modification or termination of release on supervision, under subsections (c) through (f) of this section, finds that the person is no longer affected by mental illness or deficiency, or that he no longer presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others, the court shall order him discharged from custody or from supervision. If the court finds that the person is still affected by a mental illness or deficiency and presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others, but can be controlled adequately if he is released on supervision, the court shall order him released on supervision as provided in subsection (c) of this section. If the court finds that the person has not recovered from his mental illness or deficiency and presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others and cannot adequately be controlled if he is released on supervision, the court shall order him remanded for continued care and treatment.</p>
                  <p>(h) In any hearing under this section the court may appoint one (1) or more designated examiners to examine the person and submit reports to the court. Reports filed with the court shall include, but need not be limited to, an opinion as to the mental condition of the person and whether the person presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others. To facilitate examination, the court may order the person placed in the temporary custody of any designated facility. If neither the district attorney nor the defendant or his counsel, if any, contests the findings of the report filed with the court, the court may make the determination on the basis of the report filed with the court. If the report is contested, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue. If the report is received in evidence at the hearing, the party who contests the report has the right to summon and to cross-examine the examiners who submitted the report and to offer evidence upon the issue. Other evidence regarding the person's mental condition may be introduced by either party.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a judge of a court of record in any state which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within that state to attend and testify in criminal prosecutions in this state certifies under the seal of the court that there is a criminal prosecution pending in such court, that a person being within this state is a material witness in the prosecution, and that his presence will be required for a specified number of days, upon presentation of the certificate to any judge of a court of record in the county in which such person is, the judge shall fix a time and place for hearing and shall notify the witness of the time and place.</p>
                  <p>(b) If at the hearing the judge determines that the witness is material and necessary, that it will not cause undue hardship to the witness to be compelled to attend and testify in the prosecution in the other state and that the laws of the state in which the prosecution is pending and of any other state through which the witness may be required to pass by ordinary course of travel will give to him protection from arrest and the service of civil and criminal process, he shall issue a summons with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify in the court where the prosecution is pending at a time and place specified in the summons.</p>
                  <p>(c) A witness who is summoned to attend and testify in a criminal prosecution in another state as provided by this section, shall not be compelled to attend unless he is paid or tendered by some properly authorized person compensation including mileage for each mile traveled by the ordinary route to and from the court where the prosecution is pending and witness fees for each day that he is required to travel and attend as a witness. The mileage and witness fees shall be at the same rate paid other witnesses under the laws of the state requiring attendance. A witness who has been paid or tendered the compensation required by this subsection and who fails without good cause to attend and testify as directed in the summons, shall be punished in a manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a summons issued from a court of record in this state.</p>

                  <p>(a) In any case in which the defendant is charged with incest as defined in W.S. 6-4-402(a) or sexual assault as defined in W.S. 6-2-302 through 6-2-304 and 6-2-314 through 6-2-317 and a child less than twelve (12) years of age is the victim, the judge may order the taking of a videotape deposition of the child. The videotaping shall be done under the supervision of the court.</p>
                  <p>(b) Persons allowed to be present at the videotaping of the deposition are the child, the judge, prosecutor, defendant and defense counsel, a family member who was not a witness to the offense or a support person for the child and any technicians required to operate the equipment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Before ordering the deposition, the judge shall find that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The child's testimony would be relevant and material;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The best interests of the child would be served by permitting the videotape deposition;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A potential physical or psychological harm to the child is likely to occur if the child is required to testify which would effectively render the child incapable to testify at the trial; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The defendant or his legal counsel has the opportunity to be present and to cross-examine the child at the videotape deposition.</p>
                  <p>(d) The judge may deny the defendant's face-to-face confrontation of the child at the videotape deposition if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The defendant is alleged to have inflicted physical harm or is alleged to have threatened to inflict physical harm upon the child, and physical or psychological harm to the child is likely to occur if there is a face-to-face confrontation of the child by defendant;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The defendant's legal counsel will have reasonable opportunity to confer with his client before and at any time during the videotape deposition; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The defendant will have opportunity to view and hear the proceedings while being taken.</p>
                  <p>(e) A videotape deposition may be admitted at trial in lieu of the direct testimony of the child, if the judge finds, after hearing, that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The visual and sound qualities of the videotape are satisfactory;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The videotape is not misleading;</p>
                  <p>(iii) All portions of the videotape that have been ruled inadmissible have been deleted; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) A potential physical or psychological harm to the child is likely to occur if the child is required to testify which would effectively render the child incapable to testify at the trial.</p>
                  <p>(f) Children unable to articulate what was done to them will be permitted to demonstrate the sexual act or acts committed against them with the aid of anatomically correct dolls. Such demonstrations will be under the supervision of the court and shall be videotaped to be viewed at trial, and shall be received into evidence as demonstrative evidence.</p>
                  <p>(g) Videotapes which are part of the court record are subject to a protective order to preserve the privacy of the child.</p>
                  <p>(h) If the prosecutor elects to utilize a videotaped deposition pursuant to this section and the videotape has been taken and is admissible, the child may not testify in court without the consent of the defendant.</p>

                  <p>If a defendant sentenced to pay a fine or costs defaults in payment, the court may order the defendant to show cause why he should not be committed to jail. If the court finds that the defendant's default is willful or is due to a failure on defendant's part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment and the court determines that the defendant has an ability to pay or that a reasonable probability exists that the defendant will have an ability to pay, the court may order him committed until the fine or costs, or a specified part thereof, is paid. The defendant shall be given a credit for each day of imprisonment at the rate provided by W.S. 6-10-105, and may earn additional credits against his fine or costs for work performed as provided by W.S. 7-16-101 through 7-16-104.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this act:</p>
                  <p>(i) "DNA" means deoxyribonucleic acid;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Movant" means the person filing a motion under subsection (c) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "This act" means W.S. 7-12-302 through 7-12-315.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding any law or rule of procedure that bars a motion for a new trial as untimely, a convicted person may use the results of a DNA test ordered pursuant to this act as the grounds for filing a motion for a new trial.</p>
                  <p>(c) A person convicted of a felony offense may, preliminary to the filing of a motion for a new trial, file a motion for post-conviction DNA testing in the district court that entered the judgment of conviction against him if the movant asserts under oath and the motion includes a good faith, particularized factual basis containing the following information:</p>
                  <p>(i) Why DNA evidence is material to:</p>
                  <p>(A) The identity of the perpetrator of, or accomplice to, the crime;</p>
                  <p>(B) A sentence enhancement; or</p>
                  <p>(C) An aggravating factor alleged in a capital case.</p>
                  <p>(ii) That evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows DNA testing to be conducted;</p>
                  <p>(iii) That the chain of custody is sufficient to establish that the evidence has not been substituted, contaminated or altered in any material aspect that would prevent reliable DNA testing;</p>
                  <p>(iv) That the specific evidence to be tested can be identified;</p>
                  <p>(v) That the type of DNA testing to be conducted is specified;</p>
                  <p>(vi) That the DNA testing employs a scientific method sufficiently reliable and relevant to be admissible under the Wyoming Rules of Evidence;</p>
                  <p>(vii) That a theory of defense can be presented, not inconsistent with theories previously asserted at trial, that the requested DNA testing would support;</p>
                  <p>(viii) That the evidence was not previously subjected to DNA testing, or if the evidence was previously tested one (1) of the following would apply:</p>
                  <p>(A) The result of the testing was inconclusive;</p>
                  <p>(B) The evidence was not subjected to the testing that is now requested, and the new testing may resolve an issue not resolved by the prior testing; or</p>
                  <p>(C) The requested DNA test would provide results that are significantly more accurate and probative of the identity of the perpetrator or accomplice.</p>
                  <p>(ix) That the evidence that is the subject of the request for testing has the potential to produce new, noncumulative evidence that will establish the movant's actual innocence.</p>
                  <p>(d) The court may not order DNA testing in cases in which the trial or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere occurred after January 1, 2000 and the person did not request DNA testing or present DNA evidence for strategic or tactical reasons or as a result of a lack of due diligence, unless the failure to exercise due diligence is found to be a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. A person convicted before January 1, 2000 shall not be required to make a showing of due diligence under this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notice of the motion filed under W.S. 7-12-303(c) shall be served upon the district attorney in the county in which the conviction occurred and, if applicable, the governmental agency or laboratory holding the evidence sought to be tested.</p>
                  <p>(b) The district attorney who is served shall within sixty (60) days after receipt of service of a copy of the motion, or within any additional period of time the court allows, answer or otherwise respond to the motion requesting DNA testing.</p>
                  <p>(c) The district attorney who is served may support the motion requesting DNA testing or oppose the motion with a statement of reasons and may recommend to the court, if any DNA testing is ordered, that a particular type of testing should be conducted, or object to the proposed testing laboratory, or make such other objections, recommendations or requests as will preserve the integrity of the evidence, including, but not limited to, requests for independent testing by the state or procedures in the event that the proposed testing will deplete the DNA sample.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a motion is filed pursuant to W.S. 7-12-303(c), and the motion asserts the evidence is in the custody of the state or its agents, the court shall order the state to preserve during the pendency of the proceeding all material and relevant evidence in the state's possession or control that could be subjected to DNA testing and analysis. The state shall prepare an inventory of the evidence and shall submit a copy of the inventory to the movant and to the court. If the state determines that the evidence is no longer available, the state shall notify the court and the movant of the loss or destruction of the evidence and explain its loss or destruction. The state shall provide copies of chain of custody documentation or other documents explaining the loss or destruction of the evidence. After a motion is filed under W.S. 7-12-303(c), prosecutors in the case, law enforcement officers and crime laboratory personnel shall cooperate in preserving material and relevant evidence and in determining the sufficiency of the chain of custody of the evidence which may be subject to DNA testing.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the court determines that a motion is filed in compliance with the requirements of W.S. 7-12-303(c) and the state has had opportunity to respond to the motion, the court shall set a hearing for not more than ninety (90) days after the date the motion was filed. If the court finds that the motion does not comply with the requirements of W.S. 7-12-303(c), the court may deny the motion without hearing.</p>
                  <p>(b) The hearing under subsection (a) of this section shall be heard by the judge who conducted the trial that resulted in the movant's conviction unless the judge is unavailable.</p>
                  <p>(c) The movant and the state may present evidence by sworn and notarized affidavits or by testimony; provided, however, any affidavit shall be served on the opposing party at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(d) The movant shall be required to present a prima facie case showing that the evidence supports findings consistent with the facts asserted under W.S. 7-12-303(c) and DNA testing of the specified evidence would, assuming exculpatory results, establish:</p>
                  <p>(i) The actual innocence of the movant of the offense for which the movant was convicted; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In a capital case:</p>
                  <p>(A) The movant's actual innocence of the charged or uncharged conduct constituting an aggravating circumstance; or</p>
                  <p>(B) A mitigating circumstance as a result of the DNA testing.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the court finds that the movant has presented a prima facie case showing that the evidence supports findings consistent with W.S. 7-12-303(c) and the evidence would establish actual innocence, the court may order testing, subject to W.S. 7-12-306.</p>

                  <p>(b) If the court orders that the DNA testing under W.S. 7-12-305(e) shall be conducted by a laboratory other than the state crime laboratory, the court shall require that the testing be performed:</p>
                  <p>(i) Under reasonable conditions designed to protect the state's interests in the integrity of the evidence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) By a laboratory that:</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this act:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Bona fide issue of factual innocence" means that the newly discovered evidence presented by the petitioner, if credible, would clearly establish the petitioner's factual innocence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Factual innocence" or "factually innocent" means a person:</p>
                  <p>(A) Did not engage in the conduct for which he was convicted;</p>
                  <p>(B) Did not engage in conduct constituting a lesser included or inchoate offense of the crime for which he was convicted; and</p>
                  <p>(C) Did not commit any other crime arising out of or reasonably connected to the facts supporting the indictment or information upon which he was convicted.</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Forensic science" is the application of scientific or technical practices to the recognition, collection, analysis and interpretation of evidence for criminal and civil law or regulatory issues;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Newly discovered evidence" means evidence that was not available to the petitioner at trial or during the resolution by the trial court of any motion to withdraw a guilty plea or motion for new trial and which is relevant to the determination of the issue of factual innocence, including:</p>
                  <p>(A) Evidence that was discovered prior to or in the course of any appeal or post-conviction proceedings that served in whole or in part as the basis to vacate or reverse the petitioner's conviction;</p>
                  <p>(B) Evidence that supports the claims within a petition for post-conviction relief under W.S. 7-14-101 through 7-14-108 that is pending at the time of the court's determination of factual innocence under this act; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Relevant forensic scientific evidence that was not available at the time of trial or during the resolution by the trial court of any motion to withdraw a guilty plea or motion for new trial, or that undermines forensic evidence presented at trial. Forensic scientific evidence is to be considered as "undermined" if new research or information exists that repudiates:</p>
                  <p>(I) The foundational validity of the challenged evidence or testimony. "Foundational validity" means the reliability of the method to be repeatable, reproducible and accurate in a scientific setting; or</p>
                  <p>(II) The applied validity of the method or technique. "Applied validity" means the reliability of the method or technique in practice.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>7-12-403. Petition for exoneration based on factual innocence; conduct of proceedings.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A person who has been convicted of a felony offense may petition the district court in the county in which the person was convicted for a hearing to establish that the person is factually innocent of the crime or crimes of which the person was convicted.</p>
                  <p>(b) The petition shall contain an assertion of factual innocence under oath by the petitioner and shall aver, with supporting affidavits or other credible documents, that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Newly discovered evidence exists that, if credible, establishes a bona fide issue of factual innocence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The specific evidence identified by the petitioner establishes innocence and is material to the case and the determination of factual innocence;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The material evidence identified by the petitioner is not merely cumulative of evidence that was known, is not reliant solely upon recantation of testimony by a witness against the petitioner and is not merely impeachment evidence;</p>
                  <p>(iv) When viewed with all other evidence in the case, whether admitted during trial or not, the newly discovered evidence demonstrates that the petitioner is factually innocent; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Newly discovered evidence claimed in the petition is distinguishable from any claims made in prior petitions.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court shall review the petition in accordance with the procedures in W.S. 7-12-404, and make a finding whether the petition has satisfied the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. If the court finds the petition does not meet all the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, it shall dismiss the petition without prejudice and send notice of the dismissal to the petitioner, the district attorney, and the attorney general.</p>
                  <p>(d) The petition shall also contain an averment that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Neither the petitioner nor the petitioner's counsel knew of the evidence at the time of trial or sentencing or in time to include the evidence in any previously filed post-trial motion or post-conviction petition, and the evidence could not have been discovered by the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel through the exercise of reasonable diligence; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) A court has found ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to exercise reasonable diligence in uncovering the evidence.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon entry of a finding that the petition is sufficient under subsection (b) of this section, the court shall then review the petition to determine if subsection (d) of this section has been satisfied. If the court finds that the requirements of subsection (d) of this section have not been satisfied, it may dismiss the petition without prejudice and give notice to the petitioner, the district attorney and the attorney general of the dismissal, or the court may waive the requirements of subsection (d) if the court finds the petition should proceed to hearing and that there is other evidence that could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence by the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel at trial, and the other evidence:</p>
                  <p>(i) Was not discovered by the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Is material upon the issue of factual innocence;</p>
                  <p>and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Has never been presented to a court.</p>
                  <p>(f) A person who has already obtained post-conviction relief that vacated or reversed the person's conviction or sentence may also file a petition under this act in the same manner and form as described above, if no retrial or appeal regarding this offense is pending.</p>
                  <p>(g) If some or all of the newly discovered evidence alleged in a petition filed under this act is biological evidence subject to DNA testing, the petitioner shall seek DNA testing pursuant to W.S. 7-19-401 through 7-19-406. Separate petitions may be filed simultaneously in the same court.</p>
                  <p>(h) Except as provided in this act, and unless otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this act, the petition and all subsequent proceedings shall be governed by the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure and the Wyoming Rules of Evidence and shall include the underlying criminal case number.</p>
                  <p>(j) Once a petition is filed under this section, attorneys for the state, law enforcement officers and crime laboratory personnel shall preserve the evidence that is the subject of the petition and shall preserve information to determine the sufficiency of the chain of custody of the evidence.</p>

                  <p>(a) A person filing a petition under this act shall serve notice and a copy of the petition upon the office of the district attorney where the conviction was obtained and upon the Wyoming attorney general.</p>
                  <p>(b) The assigned district judge shall conduct an initial review of the petition. If it is apparent to the court that the petitioner is merely relitigating facts, issues or evidence presented in previous proceedings or presenting issues that appear frivolous or speculative on their face, the court shall dismiss the petition, state the basis for the dismissal and serve notice of dismissal upon the petitioner, the district attorney and the attorney general. If, upon completion of the initial review, the court does not dismiss the petition, it shall order the district attorney to file a response to the petition.</p>
                  <p>(c) The district attorney shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the court's order requiring a response, or within any additional period of time the court allows, answer or otherwise respond to the petition and serve the same upon the petitioner and the attorney general.</p>
                  <p>(d) After the time for response by the district attorney has passed, the court shall order a hearing if it finds the petition meets the requirements of W.S. 7-12-403 and finds there is a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence regarding the charges of which the petitioner was convicted. No bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence exists if the petitioner is merely relitigating facts, issues or evidence presented in a previous proceeding or if the petitioner is unable to identify with sufficient specificity the nature and reliability of the newly discovered evidence that establishes the petitioner's factual innocence.</p>
                  <p>(e) Within thirty (30) days after the date the district attorney responds to the petition, the petitioner may reply. Within thirty (30) days after the time for petitioner to reply has passed, the court shall consider the petition and any response and enter an order either denying the petition or granting a hearing on the petition. The court may not grant a hearing during the period in which criminal proceedings in the matter are pending before any trial or appellate court, unless stipulated to by the parties.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the court grants a hearing, both the hearing and the final order following the hearing shall occur and be entered within one hundred fifty (150) days after the last day for the petitioner to reply to the district attorney's response to the petition, unless for good cause the court determines additional time is required.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the court sets a hearing on the petition and evidence is in the custody of the state or its agents, upon request of the petitioner, the court shall order the state to preserve all material and relevant evidence in the state's possession or control during the pendency of the proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(h) Upon motion, the court may order forensic testing of any available evidence.</p>
                  <p>(j) If the court orders forensic testing under subsection</p>
                  <p>(h) of this section, the testing shall be performed by the Wyoming state crime laboratory unless the movant establishes that the state crime laboratory has a conflict of interest or does not have the capability to perform the necessary testing.</p>
                  <p>(k) If the court orders that forensic testing under subsection (h) of this section shall be conducted by a laboratory other than the Wyoming state crime laboratory, the court shall require that the testing be performed by a laboratory that is accredited by the American society of crime laboratory directors accreditation board, ANSI-ASQ national accreditation board or a successor accrediting body.</p>
                  <p>(m) The movant shall bear the cost of forensic testing ordered under subsection (h) of this section unless the court determines the movant is needy and the forensic testing supports the movant's petition for exoneration, in which case the court shall order the state to bear the cost of the forensic testing.</p>
                  <p>(n) If the parties stipulate the evidence establishes the petitioner is factually innocent, the court may find the petitioner is factually innocent without holding a hearing. If the state will not stipulate the evidence establishes the petitioner is factually innocent, no determination of factual innocence may be made by the court without first holding a hearing.</p>
                  <p>(o) Upon stipulation of the parties or the state's motion for dismissal of the original charges against the petitioner, the court shall vacate the petitioner's conviction, issue an order of factual innocence and exoneration and order expungement of the records of the original conviction.</p>
                  <p>(p) If, after a hearing, the court determines that the petitioner has proven his factual innocence by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall issue an order of factual innocence and exoneration and shall order expungement of the records of the original conviction.</p>

                  <p>(i) His term of sentence expires; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) He satisfactorily completes a probation period.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department of corrections shall issue a certificate of restoration of voting rights as provided in this subsection and subsection (c) of this section. Upon issuance of a certificate, voting rights lost pursuant to W.S. 6-10-106 shall be deemed restored. The department of corrections shall automatically issue a person convicted of a nonviolent felony or nonviolent felonies arising out of the same occurrence or related course of events a certificate of restoration of voting rights if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person has not been convicted of any other felony other than convictions arising out of the same occurrence or related course of events for which restoration of rights is certified; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The person has completed all of his sentence, including probation or parole.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed by Laws 2017, ch. 189, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department of corrections shall issue a certificate of restoration of voting rights to eligible persons as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) For persons convicted within Wyoming of a nonviolent felony or nonviolent felonies arising out of the same occurrence or related course of events who completed their sentence before January 1, 2010, the department shall require receipt of a written request on a form prescribed by the department and issue each eligible person a certificate of restoration of voting rights following a determination that the person has completed his sentence, including probation and parole. The department shall not require an application for restoration before issuing a certificate to eligible persons who complete their sentence on and after January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For persons convicted outside of Wyoming or under federal law of a nonviolent felony or nonviolent felonies arising out of the same occurrence or related course of events, the department shall issue each eligible person a certificate of restoration of voting rights upon receipt of a written request on a form prescribed by the department and following a determination that the person has completed his sentence, including probation and parole.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department of correction's determination that a person is ineligible for a certificate of restoration of voting rights is a final action of the agency subject to judicial review. The clerk of the district court and the division of criminal investigation shall cooperate with the department of corrections in providing information necessary for determining a person's eligibility to receive a certificate of restoration of voting rights. The department of corrections shall notify the secretary of state when any person's voting rights have been restored. If the person was convicted in Wyoming, the department of corrections shall submit the certificate of restoration of voting rights to the clerk of the district court in which the person was convicted and the clerk shall file the certificate in the criminal case in which the conviction was entered.</p>
                  <p>(e) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Same occurrence or related course of events" means the same transaction or occurrence or a series of events closely related in time or location;</p>

                  <p>(e) The cost of housing convicted felons in the county jail shall be paid by the department of corrections by contract arrangement with the county sheriff. Costs shall include shelter, food, clothing, and necessary medical, dental and hospital care. Subject to legislative appropriation, the department of corrections may contract with county sheriffs to house felons sentenced under this section in county jail.</p>
                  <p>(f) If any civil action is brought against any sheriff, his under sheriff, deputy, agent or employee, by reason of acts committed or allegedly committed in the performance of necessary duties in connection with the housing and care of the convicted felons, the state shall indemnify and hold harmless the officers, agents or employees from all civil liability incurred or adjudged except punitive damage awards.

                  <p>(A) The legislature has specifically appropriated funds to pay for such placements and unencumbered appropriated funds are available for the proposed placement; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The county agrees to pay the costs of placement if sufficient funds are not available from state appropriations.</p>
                  <p>(h) A defendant sentenced under this section is not eligible for parole and is not subject to good time allowances authorized under W.S. 7-13-420.

                  <p>(a) In addition to any other punishment prescribed by law, the sentencing court may require a person sentenced to confinement in county jail, for any offense, to pay the jail facility the costs of room and board for each day of incarceration, both before and after conviction. The costs for room and board for each day of incarceration shall be an amount equal to the actual cost of the services as determined by the county sheriff. The cost of the services shall be paid to all jail facilities where the inmate may have been held before and after conviction. The costs shall not be assessed if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The court finds that the defendant has no ability to pay and that no reasonable probability exists that the defendant will have an ability to pay; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the judgment of the court, the costs would impose a manifest hardship on the inmate, or the property of the inmate is needed for the maintenance and support of the inmate's family.</p>
                  <p>(b) An order to pay room and board costs under this section shall be included as a special order in the judgment of conviction. To satisfy the order, the clerk of the sentencing court, upon request of the sheriff or prosecuting attorney, may issue execution against any assets of the defendant including wages subject to attachment, in the same manner as in a civil action.</p>
                  <p>(c) Willful failure or refusal to pay costs ordered under this section is punishable as contempt of court.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any costs paid by a person under this section shall be deposited in the county general fund to help defray the costs the jail facility incurred in providing room and board to the person.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a person who has not previously been convicted of any felony is charged with or is found guilty of or pleads guilty or no contest to any misdemeanor except any second or subsequent violation of W.S. 31-5-233 or any similar provision of law, or any second or subsequent violation of W.S. 6-2-510(a) or 6-2-511(a) or any similar provision of law, or any felony except murder, sexual assault in the first or second degree, aggravated assault and battery or arson in the first or second degree, the court may, with the consent of the defendant and the state and without entering a judgment of guilt or conviction, defer further proceedings and place the person on probation for a term not to exceed thirty-six (36) months upon terms and conditions set by the court. The terms of probation shall include that he:</p>
                  <p>(i) Report to the court not less than twice in each year at times and places fixed in the order;</p>

                  <p>(b) If the court finds the person has fulfilled the terms of probation and that his rehabilitation has been attained to the satisfaction of the court, the court may at the end of thirty-six (36) months, or at any time after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of the original probation, discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the defendant violates a term or condition of probation at any time before final discharge, the court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Enter an adjudication of guilt and conviction and proceed to impose sentence upon the defendant if he previously pled guilty to or was found guilty of the original charge for which probation was granted under this section; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Order that the trial of the original charge proceed if the defendant has not previously pled or been found guilty.</p>
                  <p>(d) Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for any purpose.</p>
                  <p>(e) There shall be only one (1) discharge and dismissal under this section or under any similar section of the probationary statutes of any other jurisdiction.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>7-13-305. Determination, continuance or extension; revocation proceedings.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The period of probation or suspension of sentence under W.S. 7-13-302 shall be determined by the court and may be reduced, continued or extended. Any term of probation including any continuations or extensions shall not exceed the maximum term of probation authorized under W.S. 7 13 302(b), except that the judge may impose a term of probation that is not greater than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by law for the offense for good cause shown upon the record and after considering public safety, rehabilitation, deterrence and any other goals of sentencing. In determining the period of probation or a modification of an existing probation, the court may consider, but is not limited to the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether the defendant has stable employment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether the defendant has positive community support;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether the defendant has positive familial support;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Whether the defendant has reasonably attended to spousal or parental responsibilities and whether the terms of probation assist or hinder the defendant in discharging those responsibilities;</p>
                  <p>(v) Whether the defendant has made progress in affirmatively addressing any alcohol or substance abuse issues. For the purposes of this paragraph, relapse alone does not prevent the court from determining the defendant has made progress in addressing his alcohol or substance use issues;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The nature and seriousness of the underlying crime;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The risk posed by the defendant to the community;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The risk of reoffense as determined by a validated risk assessment tool utilized by the department of corrections.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon the satisfactory fulfillment of the conditions of suspension of sentence or probation under W.S. 7-13-302 the court shall enter an order discharging the defendant.</p>
                  <p>(c) For a violation of a condition of probation occurring during the probationary period, revocation proceedings may be commenced at any time during the period of suspension of sentence or probation under W.S. 7-13-302, or within thirty (30) days thereafter, in which case the court may issue a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested. If after hearing the court determines that the defendant violated any of the terms of probation or suspension of sentence, the court may proceed to deal with the case as if no suspension of sentence or probation had been ordered.</p>
                  <p>(d) The time for commencing revocation proceedings shall be automatically extended for any period of time in which the probationer is incarcerated outside this state during the probationary period for the conviction of an offense which is a violation of the conditions of probation, unless the probationer has made a valid request for final disposition under the interstate agreement on detainers, W.S. 7-15-101 through 7-15-105.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>7-13-408. Probation, parole and conditional release administrative jail or adult community correction program sanction and revocation hearing procedures.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The probation and parole agent shall notify the department and the board or the appropriate court if it is determined consideration should be given to retaking or reincarcerating a person under the supervision of the department who has violated a condition of his probation, parole or other conditional release and is subject to revocation of supervision. Prior to notification, a hearing shall be held in accordance with this section within a reasonable time, unless a hearing is waived by the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee. In the case of a parolee for whom the violation is based on a new felony conviction, a preliminary hearing is not required under this section. In the case of a probationer, the hearing is only required when the probationer has been reincarcerated and a legal warrant has not been obtained within ten (10) days. As soon as practicable, following termination of any hearing, the appropriate officer or agent shall report to the department and the court or board, furnish a copy of the hearing record, report on the prior use of incentives and sanctions under W.S. 7-13- 1801 through 7-13-1803 for the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee and make recommendations regarding the disposition to be made of the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee. Compliance violations not leading to retaking or reincarceration shall be sanctioned under W.S. 7-13- 1801 and 7-13-1802. Pending any proceeding pursuant to this section, the appropriate agent may take custody of and detain the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee involved for a reasonable period of time prior to the hearing. If it appears to the hearing officer or agent that retaking or reincarceration is likely to follow, the agent may take custody of and detain the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee for a reasonable period after the hearing or waiver as may be necessary to arrange for the retaking or reincarceration.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any hearing pursuant to this section or W.S. 7-13-1803 may be before the field services administrator, his designated hearing officer or any other person authorized pursuant to the laws of this state to hear cases of alleged probation, parole or conditional release violations, except that no hearing officer shall be the person making the allegation of violation. In cases of alleged parole violations by persons who were paroled by the board, hearings pursuant to this section shall be before the executive director of the board or his designated hearing officer.</p>
                  <p>(c) With respect to any hearing pursuant to this section, the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee:</p>
                  <p>(i) Shall have reasonable notice in writing of the nature and content of the allegations to be made including notice that the purpose of the hearing is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a violation that may lead to a revocation of probation, parole or conditional release;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Shall be permitted to consult with any persons whose assistance he reasonably desires, prior to the hearing;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Shall have the right to confront and examine any person who has made allegations against him, unless the hearing officer determines that the confrontation would present a substantial present or subsequent danger of harm to the person;</p>
                  <p>(iv) May admit, deny or explain the violation alleged and may present proof, including affidavits and other evidence, in support of his contentions.</p>
                  <p>(d) A record of the proceedings under this section shall be made and preserved either by stenographic means or through the use of a recording machine.</p>
                  <p>(e) Repealed by Laws 2019, ch. 116, § 3.</p>

A person arrested under this paragraph may be detained for a reasonable period of time until a legal warrant is obtained or pending further proceedings under W.S. 7-13-408.</p>
                  <p>(b) A peace officer may arrest without warrant an alleged probation or parole violator after receiving a written statement from a probation and parole agent setting forth that the probationer or parolee has, in the judgment of the probation and parole agent, violated the conditions of his probation or parole. A peace officer may also arrest without warrant an alleged probation or parole violator at any time the peace officer has probable cause to believe the probationer or parolee has violated the conditions of his probation or parole. A person arrested under this subsection may be detained for a reasonable period of time until a legal warrant is obtained or pending further proceedings under W.S. 7-13-408.</p>

                  <p>(a) The governor, after consultation with the board and the department, shall adopt rules and regulations to establish a system of good time and special good time allowances for inmates of and parolees from any state penal institution, any institution which houses Wyoming inmates pursuant to W.S. 7-3-401 or any correctional facility operated pursuant to a contract with the state under W.S. 7-22-102 or inmates or parolees transferred to a community correctional facility pursuant to W.S. 7-18-109 or 7-18-115. The rules may provide either for good time to be deducted from the maximum sentence or for good time to be deducted from the minimum sentence imposed by the sentencing court, or both, and may provide for the removal of previously earned good time allowances and the withholding of future good time allowances.</p>
                  <p>(b) The rules and regulations adopted by the governor as provided by this section shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state but shall at all times be considered rules relating to the internal management of state penal institutions and not affecting private rights of inmates. The granting, refusal to grant, withholding or restoration of good time or special good time allowances to inmates shall be a matter of grace and not that of right of inmates.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court may adjust the period of a probationer’s supervised probation on the recommendation of the probation and parole agent, which shall be based on the probationer's positive progression towards the goals of the case plan as well as the overall compliance with the conditions imposed by the court.</p>
                  <p>(d) The rules established under subsection (a) of this section shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide that good time may be awarded for time the sentencing court awards as jail credit in the judgment and sentence if the inmate or parolee would have otherwise received good time credit if the inmate or parolee had served that time in an institution eligible under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide that good time may be awarded for any time an inmate or parolee spends in custody from the date of sentencing until admission to an institution eligible under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Require the department to consult with the county sheriff to determine whether good time should be awarded to an inmate or parolee before awarding good time for jail credit under this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(b) The board shall provide for restitution in the amount determined by the court pursuant to W.S. 7-9-103 unless the board finds the parolee is not reasonably capable of making the payments, in which case the board may modify the amount of restitution to be paid, taking into account the factors enumerated in W.S. 7-9-106.</p>

                  <p>(d) The board may waive the payment of some or all of the restitution as a condition of parole if it finds the payment of some or all of the restitution will work an undue hardship on the parolee or his family. Victims who have requested to receive notification pursuant to W.S. 1-40-204(f) of information authorized to be released pursuant to W.S. 1-40-204(d) shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the board making a decision to waive some or all of the restitution under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in this section shall limit or impair the rights of victims to sue and recover damages from the parolee in a civil action. However, any restitution payment by the parolee to a victim shall be set off against any judgment in favor of the victim in a civil action arising out of the same facts or event.</p>
                  <p>(f) The fact that restitution was required or made under this section shall not be admissible as evidence in a civil action unless offered by the parolee.</p>
                  <p>(g) In the event a victim is not satisfied with the restitution plan required or modified by the board, the victim's exclusive remedies are a civil action against the parolee or execution on the restitution order pursuant to W.S. 7-9-103(d).</p>
                  <p>(h) The board may require payment of the following obligations as conditions of parole if it finds the parolee is reasonably capable of making the payments, taking into account the factors enumerated in W.S. 7-9-106(a)(iii):</p>

                  <p>(ii) Court ordered fines, reimbursement for the services of the public defender or court appointed counsel, the surcharge imposed under W.S. 1-40-119 and the surcharge imposed under W.S. 7-13-1616;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Costs or partial costs of evaluations, treatment, services, programs or assistance the parolee is receiving;</p>

                  <p>(a) The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases, subject to state laws, by authorized criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.</p>
                  <p>(b) The compacting states recognize that there is no "right" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of state laws, this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.</p>

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs said assessment.</p>
                  <p>(c) The interstate commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its by- laws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>Article XI</p>
                  <p>Compacting States, Effective Date and Amendment</p>
                  <p>(a) Any state, as defined in article II of this compact, is eligible to become a compacting state. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five (35) of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other compacting state, upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees will be invited to participate in interstate commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.</p>
                  <p>(b) Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the interstate commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.</p>
                  <p>Article XII</p>
                  <p>Withdrawal, Default, Termination and Judicial Enforcement</p>
                  <p>(a) Section A. Withdrawal:</p>
                  <p>(i) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact ("withdrawing state") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal;</p>
                  <p>(v) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>(b) Section B. Default:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted ("defaulting state") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the by-laws or any duly promulgated rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:</p>
                  <p>(A) Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission;</p>
                  <p>(B) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission; suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the by-laws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission by-laws or duly promulgated rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council of such termination;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.</p>
                  <p>(c) Section C. Judicial enforcement. The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and by-laws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys fees.</p>
                  <p>(d) Section D. Dissolution of compact:</p>
                  <p>(i) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the by-laws.</p>
                  <p>Article XIII Severability and Construction</p>
                  <p>(a) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.</p>
                  <p>(b) The provisions of this compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.</p>
                  <p>Article XIV</p>
                  <p>Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws</p>
                  <p>(a) Section A. Other laws:</p>
                  <p>(i) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All compacting states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</p>
                  <p>(b) Section B. Binding effect of the compact:</p>
                  <p>(i) All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and by-laws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law restricting the grant of parole, except for inmates sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole, the board may grant a medical parole to any inmate meeting the conditions specified in this section. The board shall consider a medical parole upon receipt of written certification by a licensed treating physician that, within a reasonable degree of certainty, one (1) of the following circumstances exist:</p>
                  <p>(i) The inmate has a serious incapacitating medical need which requires treatment that cannot reasonably be provided while confined in a state correctional facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The inmate is incapacitated by age to the extent that deteriorating physical or mental health substantially diminishes the ability of the inmate to provide self-care within the environment of a correctional facility;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The inmate is permanently physically incapacitated as the result of an irreversible injury, disease or illness which makes significant physical activity impossible, renders the inmate dependent on permanent medical intervention for survival or confines the inmate to a bed, wheelchair or other assistive device where his mobility is significantly limited; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) The inmate suffers from a terminal illness caused by injury or disease which is predicted to result in death within twelve (12) months of the application for parole.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board may only grant a medical parole if it first determines:</p>
                  <p>(i) That, based on a review of all available information, one (1) or more of the conditions specified in subsection (a) of this section exists;</p>
                  <p>(ii) That the inmate is not likely to abscond or violate the law if released;</p>
                  <p>(iii) That living arrangements are in place in the community and sufficient resources are available to meet the inmate's living and medical needs and expenses; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) That the inmate does not have a medical condition that would endanger public health, safety or welfare if the inmate were released, or that the inmate's proposed living arrangements would protect the public health, safety or welfare from any threat of harm the inmate's medical condition may pose.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon the board's request, an independent medical evaluation by a licensed physician shall be conducted, provided to the board and paid for by the department.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board shall provide the prosecuting attorney and the sentencing court with prior notice of, and the opportunity to provide input regarding, a medical parole hearing for an inmate who is otherwise ineligible for parole.</p>
                  <p>(e) The board shall impose terms and conditions of parole as it deems necessary, including but not limited to requiring periodic medical progress reports at intervals of not more than six (6) months, in granting a medical parole. A medical parole may be revoked if the parolee violates a condition of parole or if the medical condition which was the basis for the grant of parole no longer exists or has been ameliorated to the extent that the justification for medical parole no longer exists.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the court finds from the notice in W.S. 7-13-901(b) that there is reasonable cause to believe that the convict does not have the requisite mental capacity, the court shall stay the execution and order an examination of the convict by a designated examiner. The order may direct examination at the place of confinement or at any other designated facility.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the order provides for examination at a designated facility, commitment to that facility for the study of the mental condition of the convict shall continue no longer than a thirty (30) day period.</p>

If such an examination is ordered, a report conforming to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section shall be furnished to the court and to the opposing party.</p>

If the opinion is contested, the court shall conduct a hearing at which the report or reports may be received in evidence. The parties may summon and cross-examine the persons who provided the report or rendered opinions contained therein and offer evidence upon the issue of the convict's requisite mental capacity.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the convict does not have the requisite mental capacity, the judge shall suspend the execution of the convict until a time when it is found that the convict has the requisite mental capacity.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon the court finding that the convict does not have the requisite mental capacity, the court shall issue notice thereof to the convict, the governor, the attorney general and the district attorney.</p>

                  <p>If a person has been convicted of a violent felony or delivery or unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance under W.S. 35-7-1031, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person is not a "qualified offender" for purposes of sentencing under this act. This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the person who is an otherwise qualified offender convicted of a violent felony could participate in a treatment program without posing an unreasonable risk to the safety of the public. As to persons convicted of manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance, the presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the person committed the crime because of his own dependency.</p>

                  <p>(i) To reduce recidivism by participants;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To strive for program retention and graduation of participants;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To strive for sobriety of participants; and</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created a court supervised treatment program account. All interest earned on funds within this account shall be deposited in the account. The department shall oversee and provide funding for programs from the court supervised treatment program account. Funds within the account shall be expended by the department for the purposes of this act upon legislative appropriation provided, however, that surcharges deposited in the account pursuant to W.S. 7-13-1616(e) shall be distributed to programs by the department semiannually. Department expenses under this act shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total amount of funding provided by the department for programs in any fiscal biennium.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department shall determine whether an application for a program meets the qualifications specified in W.S. 7-13-1606(b) and the rules and regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement this act, including establishing standards consistent with the key components of drug courts defined by the United States department of justice or such similar rules as may be adopted by the department. The rules shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Specify funding formulas for funding from the account which formula shall include provisions requiring local contribution to the cost of a program;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Require participants to contribute financially to their own program;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Establish program requirements, operational standards and protocols for programs, program team and staff training requirements, program data collection and maintenance, certification requirements for treatment personnel, and incentive and sanction limitations.</p>
                  <p>(d) A panel, consisting of the attorney general, the directors of the department of health, department of family services and department of corrections, the chairman of the governor's advisory board on substance abuse and violent crimes and the state public defender, or their designees, shall make the final determination whether an application for a court supervised treatment program meets the qualifications of this act and shall determine the funding amount for each successful applicant. The panel may deny an application for a new program if the funding for the new program would substantially affect funding levels for existing programs.</p>
                  <p>(e) In addition to those funds deposited in the account created by this section, the department may accept, and shall deposit to the account, any gifts, contributions, donations, grants or federal funds specifically given to the department for the benefit of programs in Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(f) Nothing in this act shall prohibit a program from obtaining or providing supplemental funding. All supplemental funds received by a program shall be reported to the department.</p>

                  <p>(i) Has entered an admission, or a guilty or nolo contendere plea;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has entered a guilty plea pursuant to W.S. 7-13-301;</p>

                  <p>(b) Any district, juvenile, circuit, municipal or tribal court judge, or magistrate, may refer substance offenders for participation in a program. The referring judge may act as a participating judge in a program as authorized by this act and by rules adopted by the supreme court. A substance offender who is a defendant in a criminal action or a respondent in a juvenile court action may be referred for participation in a program if:</p>
                  <p>(i) A substance abuse assessment reveals that the person is in need of treatment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The referring judge has reason to believe that participation in a program will benefit the person by addressing his substance abuse;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In a juvenile court case, the referring judge has reason to believe that participation by the child's parent or guardian will be in the best interest of the child; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) The person's case is processed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Participation in a program shall only be with the consent of the referring judge and the participant, and acceptance of the participant by the program team in accordance with a written agreement between the participant and the program team.

Prior to a participant's entry into a written agreement, the participating judge shall inform the participant that he may be subject to a term of probation that exceeds the maximum term of imprisonment established for the particular offense charged, as provided in W.S. 5-9-134 and 7-13-1614.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing in this act shall confer a right or an expectation of a right to participate in a program, nor does this act obligate a program team to accept any proposed participant. Neither the establishment of a program nor anything herein contained shall be construed as limiting the discretion of a prosecuting attorney in regard to the prosecution of any criminal or juvenile case. Consent to participation in a program under subsection (c) of this section shall only be required from the referring judge and participant.</p>

                  <p>(a) A probation and parole agent who reasonably believes that a defendant, probationer, parolee or conditional releasee has committed one (1) or more compliance violations that require a sanction shall utilize sanctions available within the incentives and sanctions system to determine an appropriate response. Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the agent shall initiate a hearing in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and W.S. 7-13-408 and shall attempt to gain the person's compliance with the conditions of probation, parole or conditional release through the sanctions provided in W.S. 7-13- 1802.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any hearing under this section shall be before the field services administrator, his designated hearing officer or any other person authorized pursuant to the laws of this state to hear cases of alleged probation, parole or conditional release violations, except that no hearing officer shall be the person making the allegation of violation. If the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant, probationer, parolee or conditional releasee has violated a condition of probation, parole or conditional release, the hearing officer shall utilize the incentives and sanctions system to determine an appropriate response, which may include the sanctions authorized under W.S. 7-13-1802.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any imposition of custodial sanctions shall be subject to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) All time in custody related to the compliance violation shall be credited toward the defendant's, probationer's, parolee's or conditional releasee's sentence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The total of all confinement under W.S. 7-13- 1802(b)(i) and (ii) shall not exceed eighteen (18) days during the term of probation, parole or conditional release;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Cumulative custodial sanctions imposed under W.S. 7-13-1802(b)(i) through (iii) shall not exceed ninety (90) days during the term of probation, parole or conditional release prior to any revocation.</p>
                  <p>(d) A hearing shall be held before custodial sanctions are imposed. The imposition of sanctions shall not require a hearing if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The probationer or parolee is a participant in the intensive supervision program pursuant to W.S. 7-13-1105;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The probationer is a qualified offender whose probation has been previously revoked pursuant to W.S. 7-13- 1303(d); or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The probationer or parolee consents to the administrative sanction without a hearing.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon agreement of the sheriff and the director of the department of corrections, the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee may be maintained at the county jail at an agreed per diem rate to be paid by the department. The department shall pay for any medical treatment of the probationer, parolee or conditional releasee, other than for conditions demanding immediate medical attention which can be treated at the county jail for which the county is liable under W.S. 18-6-303(c)(i). Except for emergency medical treatment, no treatment which is the responsibility of the department under this subsection shall be provided without the prior approval of the department.</p>
                  <p>(f) If any civil action is brought against any sheriff, his undersheriff, deputy, agent or employee, by reason of acts committed or allegedly committed in the performance of necessary duties in connection with the housing and care of a probation, parole or conditional release violator under this section, the state shall indemnify and hold harmless the officers, agents or employees from all civil liability incurred or adjudged except punitive damage awards. Upon request, the state shall provide legal counsel at the state's expense to assist in the defense of any action referred to in this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(g) Probationers, parolees and conditional releasees committed to the county jail or a residential community correctional program pursuant to this section shall be housed in accordance with subsection (e) of this section or W.S. 7-18- 115(b).</p>

                <p>(a) A claim under this act is procedurally barred and no court has jurisdiction to decide the claim if the claim:</p>
                <p>(i) Could have been raised but was not raised in a direct appeal from the proceeding which resulted in the petitioner's conviction;</p>
                <p>(ii) Was not raised in the original or an amendment to the original petition under this act; or</p>

                <p>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(i) of this section, a court may hear a petition based on any of the following:</p>
                <p>(i) The petitioner sets forth facts supported by affidavits or other credible evidence which was not known or reasonably available to him at the time of a direct appeal;</p>
                <p>(ii) The court finds from a review of the trial and appellate records that the petitioner's appellate counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to assert a claim that was likely to result in a reversal of the petitioner's conviction or sentence on his direct appeal. This finding may be reviewed by the supreme court together with any further action of the district court taken on the petition; or</p>
                <p>(iii) The petitioner was represented by the same attorney in the trial and appellate courts.</p>
                <p>(c) This act does not apply to claims of error or denial of rights in any proceeding:</p>
                <p>(i) For the revocation of probation or parole;</p>

              <content>
                <p><shortTitle>7-15-101. Contents and form of agreement on detainers.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>The agreement on detainers is hereby enacted into law and entered into by the state of Wyoming with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: the contracting states solemnly agree that:</p>
                <p>Article I</p>
                <p>The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.</p>
                <p>Article II</p>
                <p>(a) As used in this agreement:</p>
                <p>(i) "State" shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the commonwealth of Puerto Rico;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Sending state" shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Receiving state" shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV hereof.</p>
                <p>Article III</p>
                <p>(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial at the next term of court after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint; provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.</p>
                <p>(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>
                <p>(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.</p>
                <p>(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p>
                <p>(e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph</p>
                <p>(d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.</p>
                <p>(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.</p>
                <p>Article IV</p>
                <p>(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated; provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.</p>
                <p>(b) Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.</p>
                <p>(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.</p>
                <p>(d) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.</p>
                <p>(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p>
                <p>Article V</p>
                <p>(a) In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.</p>
                <p>(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:</p>
                <p>(i) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given;</p>
                <p>(ii) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.</p>
                <p>(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the periods provided by this act, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.</p>
                <p>(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one (1) or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.</p>
                <p>(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purpose of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.</p>
                <p>(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.</p>
                <p>(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.</p>
                <p>(h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one (1) or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had, shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.</p>
                <p>Article VI</p>
                <p>(a) In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.</p>
                <p>(b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.</p>
                <p>Article VII</p>
                <p>Each state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.</p>
                <p>Article VIII</p>
                <p>This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.</p>
                <p>Article IX</p>
                <p>This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the states affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p>(a) All prisoners sentenced to the custody of the department of corrections to serve a term of imprisonment in a state penal institution may be employed within the institution or in any work for the benefit of and use by the state or any of its agencies or political subdivisions.</p>
                  <p>(b) An inmate of a state penal institution shall be required to perform available hard labor which is suited to the inmate's age, gender, physical and mental condition, strength and attainments in the institution proper, in the industries established in connection with the institution, or at other places as provided in subsection (a) of this section. Substantially equivalent hard labor programs shall be available to both male and female inmates. Inmates performing hard labor at a location other than within or on the grounds of a state penal institution shall be attired in brightly colored uniforms that readily identify them as inmates of state penal institutions. The employment of inmates in hard labor shall not displace employed workers, shall not be applied to skills, crafts or trades in which a local surplus of labor exists, and shall not impair existing contracts for employment or services.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of this section, "hard labor" means physical or mental labor which is performed for a period of time which shall average, as nearly as possible, forty (40) hours each week, and may include useful and productive work. "Hard labor" may include menial labor, any training necessary to perform any work required, and if possible, work providing an inmate with marketable vocational skills. "Hard labor" does not include labor which is dangerous to an inmate's life or health, is unduly painful or is required to be performed under conditions that would violate occupational safety and health standards applicable to such labor if performed by a person who is not an inmate.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, an inmate who has been determined by the institution administrator to be unsuitable for the performance of hard labor due to the inmate's age, gender, physical or mental condition, strength or security status shall not be required to perform hard labor.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department of corrections shall adopt rules to implement this section.</p>

                  <p>(i) An offender in custody of the department, a local jail or a public or private agency pursuant to a court order during the period in which the offender is in custody;</p>

The application and information shall detail the offender's financial status for a period of not less than one (1) year preceding the date of the application;</p>
                  <p>(C) If an offender is unable to submit a complete application at the time of registration or reporting updated information, the offender may submit an application to the division or the sheriff of the county in which the offender is required to register or report updated information within thirty (30) days of registration or reporting. Failure to submit an application and all required information within thirty (30) days of registration or reporting updated information shall be deemed to be a waiver of the offender's ability to request a determination of indigency and the fees required under subsection (r) of this section shall be payable;</p>
                  <p>(D) The division shall approve or deny an application for a determination of indigency and provide notice of the determination to the offender within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application;</p>
                  <p>(E) The division's determination that the offender is indigent shall be valid for a period of one (1) calendar year from the registration or reporting updated information date for which the application was submitted. Upon the expiration of the period, the offender may submit an application for a new determination of indigency;</p>
                  <p>(F) If the division determines the offender is not indigent, the offender shall pay the fees required under subsection (r) of this section within thirty (30) days from the date the offender receives notice of the denial. An offender may apply for a determination of indigency only once per calendar year, unless the offender can show a material change in circumstances;</p>
                  <p>(G) The division's determination that an offender is not indigent is an agency action subject to judicial review as provided under W.S. 16-3-114 and 16-3-115.</p>
                  <p>(t) The sheriff of the county in which the offender is required to register or report updated information shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Collect the fees required under subsection (r) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Retain the county registration and reporting fees collected to be expended for purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of this act and to cover the administrative expenses and costs of collecting and remitting the state registration and reporting fees;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Remit to the division the state registration and reporting fees to be deposited in the sex offender registration account created by W.S. 7-19-310; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Forward to the division any applications for a determination of indigency.</p>
                  <p>(u) If an offender fails to pay the fees required under subsection (r) of this section, the sheriff of the county in which the offender is required to register or report updated information shall provide to the division the registration or reporting information required under this act and notify the division of the offender's failure to pay. Unpaid fees become delinquent thirty (30) days after the date the fee is imposed, the date the offender waives the ability to request a determination of indigency by failing to submit an application or the date the division notifies the offender he does not qualify as indigent, whichever is later. Unpaid fees may be collected by the division as otherwise provided by law and as provided in W.S. 9-1-415(a). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the prosecution of an offender for failure to register or report updated information or for any other offense.</p>

                  <p>(b) An arrest on charges of failure to register, service of an information or complaint for a violation of this act, or arraignment on charges for a violation of this act, constitutes actual notice of the duty to register. Any person charged with the crime of failure to register under this act who asserts as a defense the lack of notice of the duty to register shall register immediately following actual notice of the duty through arrest, service or arraignment.

                <p>(a) Any person arrested pursuant to W.S. 7-20-102 shall be brought before the court having jurisdiction in the cause without unnecessary delay. At the initial appearance under this section the court shall:</p>

                  <p>(d) A private-company detention officer who is trained pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, shall have the right to carry and use firearms and shall exercise such authority and use deadly force only as a last resort when reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of a violent felony as defined in W.S. 6-1-104(a)(xii), to prevent the escape of a convicted felon from custody, or to defend the officer or any other person from imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.</p>
                  <p>(e) Within three (3) days following an incident involving the use of force against an inmate or another, the employee shall file a written report describing the incident with the administrative staff of the facility and with the contract monitor appointed pursuant to W.S. 7-22-108.</p>
