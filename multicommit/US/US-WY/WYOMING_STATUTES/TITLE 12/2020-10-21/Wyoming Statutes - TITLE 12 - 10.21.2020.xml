Wholesale licensees have the exclusive right to sell malt beverages at wholesale. Any qualified person desiring a wholesale license shall apply to the division on forms to be provided and pay a license fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) annually in advance. A wholesale license issued under this subsection shall be subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of this section, no brewery or malt beverage importer may have any legal ownership interest, in whole or in part, in the license, business, assets or corporate stock of a licensee under this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The division may issue a temporary wholesale license under this subsection to a brewery or malt beverage importer if a current licensee who has been granted distribution rights for a brand in a designated sales territory is unable to service the territory as a result of the loss of his license, bankruptcy or insolvency, and the loss of license, bankruptcy or insolvency is not the result of action by the brewery or malt beverage importer that is prohibited under the franchise agreement. A temporary license under this paragraph may be issued for a period not to exceed one (1) year and shall be limited to the sale of products in the designated territory;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to impair any contract between a brewery, microbrewery, malt beverage manufacturer or malt beverage importer and a distributor.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each applicant shall submit to the division a statement under oath designating clearly the geographical territory within which the applicant will sell and deliver malt beverages to qualified retail liquor and malt beverage licensees or permittees only. The territory is to be that designated by the brewer or brewer's authorized agent whose product the applicant sells. The application shall state that malt beverages sold by the applicant may be purchased by all retail liquor licensees or malt beverage permittees, and that the applicant will maintain a warehouse and delivery facilities within the territory designated. This subsection does not apply to a licensed malt beverage wholesaler when there has been no territorial designation of a brand by a brewer or the brewer's authorized agent to another licensed wholesaler. The division may authorize a licensed wholesaler to annually purchase not more than one hundred fifteen (115) gallons of any unassigned brand. A retail liquor licensee or malt beverage permittee shall purchase all malt beverages for retail sale only from a Wyoming wholesale malt beverage licensee.</p>
                  <p>(c) A malt beverage wholesaler may sell to or purchase from another malt beverage wholesaler only those products the purchasing wholesaler is licensed to sell within his designated territory. A copy of the invoice of the transaction shall be submitted to the division by the seller. State excise tax shall be reported and paid by the licensed malt beverage wholesaler who has imported the products into the state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The division may grant the number of licenses it deems appropriate and at points within the state as it may select.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, restaurant liquor licensees shall not sell alcoholic or malt beverages for off-premises consumption from the licensed building owned or leased by the licensee. Except as provided in subsections (b) and (e) of this section, alcoholic or malt beverages shall be served for on-premises consumption only in dining areas which are adequately staffed and equipped for all food services offered by the restaurant.</p>
                  <p>(b) Alcoholic and malt beverages shall be dispensed and prepared for consumption in one (1) room, and one (1) additional room if authorized and approved by the local licensing authority, upon the licensed premises separated from the dining area in which alcoholic and malt beverages may be served and in the case of a golf course upon which a restaurant liquor license is operational or in the case of a guest ranch upon which a retail or restaurant liquor license is operational, at dispensing areas on the premises of the golf course or guest ranch as permitted by the licensing authority. No consumption of alcoholic or malt beverages shall be permitted within the dispensing room, nor shall any person other than employees over eighteen (18) years of age be permitted to enter the dispensing room. If a restaurant has a dispensing room separate from the dining area which is licensed prior to February 1, 1979 for purposes of alcoholic or malt beverage sales and consumption, the restaurant may dispense alcoholic or malt beverages in the separate dispensing room under a restaurant liquor license, and any person over eighteen (18) years of age is permitted to enter the separate dispensing room.</p>

For purposes of this subsection the term "full course meal" shall mean a diversified selection of food which is ordinarily consumed with the use of tableware and cannot conveniently be consumed while standing or walking. A partially consumed bottle of wine that is to be removed from the premises pursuant to this subsection shall be securely sealed by the licensee or an agent of the licensee and placed in a tamper- proof transparent bag which shall also be securely sealed prior to removal from the premises, so that it is visibly apparent that the resealed bottle of wine has not been tampered with. The licensee or agent of the licensee shall provide a dated receipt for the bottle of wine to the patron. Wine which is resealed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall not be deemed an open container for purposes of W.S. 31-5-235.</p>
                  <p>(f) For purposes of this section, "room" means, as approved by the local licensing authority, an enclosed and partitioned space within a building large enough for a person to enter but not a cabinet.

                  <p><shortTitle>12-7-201. Civil action; administrative and judicial proceedings; disposition of liquors.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An action to revoke any Wyoming liquor license or permit may be brought in the name of the state of Wyoming by the attorney general, any county attorney or the licensing authority for the reason that the licensee or permittee has violated this title.</p>
                  <p>(b) Actions to revoke licenses are civil actions and shall be tried before the court without a jury. The revocation proceedings shall be in accordance with the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, and the trial and all other matters to come before the court shall have a priority upon the court calendar. If, upon trial, it appears that the license or permit of the licensee should be revoked, the court shall enter its order accordingly. The court may revoke the license or permit upon proof that the intent and purpose of this title has been violated. The fact that no criminal proceeding has been instituted or that no law with sanctions has been violated is not a defense to the action. Upon the application of the state and upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that there are probable grounds for believing the license holder's license should be revoked, the court may issue an order suspending a license during the pendency of an action for its revocation and no bond shall be required as a condition to the issuance of the suspension order. Appeal from the final district court decision may be taken according to the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure, but the order of revocation shall remain in effect pending a decision by the appellate court.</p>
                  <p>(c) The provisions of this section are cumulative and shall not be construed as preventing the division from revoking a liquor license in any case authorized by law.</p>
                  <p>(d) The division may revoke any license or permit issued under this title for violation of any of the rules and regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to this title or for violation of any of the provisions of this title. Prior to suspension or final revocation of a license or permit under this chapter the division shall issue at least two (2) written notices of the intent to revoke or suspend the license or permit to the licensee. The notices shall be provided at least one (1) week apart and the final notice shall be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to any suspension or revocation. The notice shall identify the violation warranting revocation or suspension of the license or permit, the date when it will be suspended or revoked and the ability to appeal and to continue to operate as provided in this subsection. Unless the division orders otherwise, a licensee may continue to operate under the license or permit pending an appeal of a license suspension or revocation to the state board of equalization made under this subsection. Any appeal shall be filed with the state board of equalization not more than thirty (30) days following the suspension or revocation of the license or permit. Appeals before the state board shall be conducted as a contested case under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and the state board shall either affirm or deny the action taken by the division. The state board may affirm an order of immediate suspension of a license or permit if the division demonstrates that the licensee should not be permitted to operate pending the outcome of an appeal made under this subsection. The decision of the state board shall be subject to judicial review under W.S. 16-3-114 except that the review shall not operate to stay a revocation or suspension order of the division during the pendency of the district court proceeding or during a later appeal to the supreme court. Should the license or permit of a licensee expire during the pendency of an appeal before the state board or in any of the courts of this state, no new or renewal license shall be granted by the licensing authority to the licensee or any other person pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon the final revocation of a liquor license or permit, all alcoholic liquors in the possession of the license holder and which are in merchantable condition shall be delivered to the division which shall reimburse the license holder for the value thereof at its then regular wholesale prices. All malt beverages and nonmerchantable alcoholic liquors shall be disposed of at the direction of the division.</p>

                  <p>(a) It shall be a violation of this act for a manufacturer or manufacturer's officer, agent or other representative thereof:</p>
                  <p>(i) To coerce or compel, or attempt to coerce or compel, any malt beverage distributor to order or accept delivery of any malt beverage or any other commodity which the distributor has not voluntarily ordered;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of the distributor's order to any distributor having a franchise for the distribution and sale of malt beverages by such manufacturer, malt beverages covered by the franchise or contract. However, the refusal to deliver malt beverages shall not be considered a violation of this section if the refusal is due to failure of the distributor to pay the manufacturer pursuant to the contract, the distributor's insolvency, an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo or other cause over which the manufacturer, or any agent thereof, shall have no control;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To coerce or compel, or attempt to coerce or compel, a malt beverage distributor to enter into any agreement, whether written or oral, supplementary to an existing franchise with the manufacturer or officer, agent or other representative thereof, by threatening to cancel any franchise or any contractual agreement existing between the manufacturer and distributor. However, notice in good faith by a manufacturer to a malt beverage distributor of the distributor's violation or breach of any terms or provisions of a franchise or contractual agreement shall not constitute a violation of this act if the notice is in writing, is mailed by registered or certified mail to the distributor at his current business address, and contains the specific facts of the distributor's alleged violation or breach of the franchise or contractual agreement;</p>
                  <p>(iv) To terminate, cancel, fail to renew or refuse to continue the franchise of any distributor without good cause, as defined in this act. The nonrenewal of a franchise or selling agreement without good cause shall constitute an unfair termination or cancellation, regardless of the specified time period of the franchise or selling agreement;</p>
                  <p>(v) To discriminate, either directly or indirectly, in price, programs or terms of sale offered to franchisees, where the effect of the discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition among distributors or to give to one (1) holder of a franchise any competitive advantage over other holders of the same or similar franchise;</p>
                  <p>(vi) To prevent or attempt to prevent, by contract or otherwise, any malt beverage distributor from changing the capital structure of his distributorship or the means by or through which he finances the operation of his distributorship;</p>
                  <p>(vii) To require a malt beverage distributor to assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this act. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or prohibit good faith dispute settlements entered into by the parties;</p>
                  <p>(viii) To restrict or inhibit, directly or indirectly, the right of free association among manufacturers or distributors of malt beverage for any lawful purpose;</p>
                  <p>(ix) To fix or maintain the price at which a distributor may resell malt beverages;</p>
                  <p>(x) To coerce, or attempt to coerce, any distributor to accept delivery of any malt beverage or other commodity ordered by a distributor if the order was properly canceled by the distributor in accordance with the reasonable procedures of the manufacturer;</p>
                  <p>(xi) To change a distributor's quota of a brand or brands, if the change is not made in good faith;</p>
                  <p>(xii) To require a distributor, by any means, to participate in or contribute to any local or national advertising fund controlled directly or indirectly by a manufacturer;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) To take any retaliatory action against a distributor that files a complaint regarding an alleged violation by the manufacturer of state or federal law or an administrative rule;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) To require or prohibit without good cause any change in the manager or successor manager of any distributor who has been approved by the manufacturer as of the effective date of this act. Should a distributor change an approved manager or successor manager, a manufacturer shall not require or prohibit the change unless the person fails to meet the reasonable standards for similarly situated distributors of the manufacturer;</p>
                  <p>(xv) To sell or supply any brand or brand extension of malt beverages in this state to a licensed wholesaler other than the licensed wholesaler designated as the exclusive wholesaler for a specific territory for such brand or brand extension by the supplier in a written agreement, except that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a supplier from providing malt beverages to consumers in an area on such supplier's premises designated as a hospitality area, or from participating in consumer sampling or taste testing programs of brands of malt beverages not sold to licensed wholesalers in this state, or from otherwise operating as permitted by law;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) To require for any reason that a wholesaler purchase one (1) or more brands of malt beverages in order for the wholesaler to purchase another brand or brands of malt beverages.</p>
                  <p>(b) It shall be a violation of this act for a distributor, partner, shareholder or officer or agent thereof to have the right to sell, transfer or assign the management or control ownership of greater than ten percent (10%) of a distributorship without the written consent of the manufacturer, except that the consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No manufacturer shall unreasonably withhold or delay its approval of any assignment, sale or transfer of the stock of a distributor or of all or any portion of a distributor's assets, distributor's voting stock, the voting stock of any parent corporation or the beneficial ownership or control of any other entity owning or controlling a distributor, including the distributor's rights and obligations under the terms of an agreement, whenever the person to be substituted meets reasonable qualifications. For purposes of this subsection, "unreasonably withhold or delay" means a period in excess of ninety (90) days after receipt by the manufacturer of all information reasonably required from the wholesaler and purchaser. Upon the death or disability of one (1) of the officers, partners or stockholder of greater than ten percent (10%) ownership of a corporate distributorship operating the business of a distributor, no manufacturer shall deny the surviving officers, partners of the partnership or stockholders of the distributorship, the right to become a successor-in- interest to the agreement between the manufacturer and the distributorship, provided that the survivor has been active in the management of the distributor's business and is otherwise capable of carrying on the business of the distributorship. However, upon the death of a distributor, no manufacturer shall deny approval for any transfer of ownership to a designated member of the family of an owner of a distributorship, provided, that the subsequent transfer of ownership by the designated member shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this subsection.</p>

However, an existing stockholder shall have the right to purchase the stock of the offending stockholder, and, if the sale is completed within the thirty (30) day period, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply. Any such purchase shall be subject to W.S. 12-9-104(a)(viii);</p>
                  <p>(iv) The distributor intentionally sells the supplier's products to a retailer or retailers outside that distributor's assigned territory;</p>

                  <p>(a) In the event that a distributor is terminated by a manufacturer in bad faith or for other than good cause, the distributor shall be entitled to additional compensation from the manufacturer for:</p>
                  <p>(i) The fair market value of any and all assets, including ancillary business assets of the distributor used in distributing the manufacturer's products;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The good will of the business.</p>
                  <p>(b) The total compensation to be paid by the manufacturer to the distributor shall be reduced by any sum received by the distributor from sale of assets of the business used in distribution of the manufacturer's products as well as by whatever value such assets may have to the distributor that are unrelated to the manufacturer's products.</p>
                  <p>(c) As used in this section, "fair market value" means the highest dollar amount at which a seller would be willing to sell and a buyer willing to buy when each possesses all information relevant to the transaction.</p>

If so submitted, the following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Arbitration shall proceed only if all parties agree in advance and submit the dispute to arbitration, and the decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding if so agreed upon by the parties in advance of the arbitrator's proceedings;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The dispute shall be submitted to a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one (1) of which shall be selected by the supplier within thirty (30) days after the parties have agreed to arbitrate, one (1) of which shall be selected by the wholesaler within thirty (30) days after the parties have agreed to arbitrate, and one (1) of which shall be selected from a list of five (5) candidates supplied by the American Arbitration Association at the request of the parties within ten (10) days after the parties have agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Within ten (10) days after receipt of the list supplied pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the wholesaler and the supplier each may disqualify up to two (2) candidates from the list. The American Arbitration Association shall select the third arbitrator from the candidates not disqualified by the parties;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association within thirty (30) days after the selection of the arbitration panel has been completed;</p>
                  <p>(v) The cost of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties. The award of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on the parties if so agreed upon in advance by the parties. The arbitrators shall not be permitted to award punitive damages and are bound to apply the terms and provisions of the agreement not in conflict with this act.</p>
