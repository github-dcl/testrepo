                  <p>(a) Upon the filing of a petition for a temporary guardian other than a petition for temporary guardianship for educational, medical care and dental care purposes pursuant to W.S. 3-2-301 through 3-2-303 and after a hearing the court may appoint a temporary guardian subject to any notice and conditions the court prescribes.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except upon a showing of good cause, an order appointing a temporary guardian of an adult ward shall be limited to not more than ninety (90) days. The court may order an extension of the temporary guardianship for not more than an additional ninety (90) days, or conversion to a guardianship or conservatorship in accordance with W.S. 3-2-101 through 3-2-105 or 3-3-101 through 3-3-106.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except upon a showing of good cause, an order appointing a temporary guardian of a minor ward shall be limited to not more than one (1) year.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the court finds that compliance with the procedures specified in this chapter will likely result in substantial harm to the proposed ward's health, safety or welfare, and that no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in the circumstances, the court, on petition by a person interested in the proposed ward's welfare, may appoint an emergency guardian. Immediately upon receipt of the petition for an emergency guardianship, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the proposed ward's best interests in the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, reasonable notice of the time and place of a hearing on the petition shall be given to the proposed ward and any other persons as the court directs.</p>
                  <p>(e) An emergency guardian may be appointed without notice to the proposed ward or the guardian ad litem only if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence from affidavit or testimony that the proposed ward will be substantially harmed before a hearing on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian immediately, without notice to the proposed ward or the guardian ad litem, the proposed ward and guardian ad litem shall be given notice of the appointment within forty-eight (48) hours after the appointment. The court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment within seventy-two (72) hours after the appointment. Emergency guardians appointed without notice and hearing shall have authority to make medical and medically related decisions only, except emergency guardians shall not have authority with respect to a person who has been made a ward pursuant to this subsection or subsection (d) of this section to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Execute a durable power of attorney for healthcare for the ward pursuant to W.S. 35-22-403(b);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Execute an individual instruction for the ward pursuant to W.S. 35-22-403(a);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Execute a cardiopulmonary resuscitation directive for the ward pursuant to W.S. 35-22-201 through 35-22-208;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Commit or admit the ward to a mental health facility; or</p>
                  <p>(v) Direct the withdrawal of life sustaining procedures being used on the ward.</p>
                  <p>(f) Appointment of an emergency guardian, with or without notice, is not a determination of the proposed ward's incapacity.</p>
                  <p>(g) At the seventy-two (72) hour hearing to determine the appropriateness of the appointment of an emergency guardian required by subsection (e) of this section, the court may appoint a temporary guardian pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The court may remove an emergency guardian at any time.</p>
                  <p>(h) Except as provided in subsections (d) through (g) of this section, all other provisions of this chapter concerning guardians apply to an emergency guardian.</p>

                  <p>(a) The court may appoint any qualified person as guardian of an incompetent person or a minor. The court may not appoint a person to be a guardian of an incompetent person or a minor if the person proposed to act as guardian:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provides, or is likely to provide during the guardianship period, substantial services to the ward in a professional or business capacity unrelated to the person's authority as a guardian;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Is, or is likely to become during the guardianship period, a creditor of the ward, other than in the capacity as guardian;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Has, or is likely to have during the guardianship period, interests that may conflict with those of the ward; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Is employed by a person who would be disqualified under paragraphs (i) through (iii) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) A person may be appointed as guardian of a respondent, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section that would otherwise disqualify the person, if the person is the spouse, adult child, parent or sibling of the respondent and the court determines that the potential conflict of interest is insubstantial and that the appointment would clearly be in the best interests of the respondent.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subject to subsection (e) of this section, qualified persons have priority for appointment as guardian of an incompetent person in the following order:</p>
                  <p>(i) A person nominated by the respondent if at the time of the nomination the respondent has the capacity to make a reasonably intelligent choice;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The spouse of the respondent;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A nomination in the will of the respondent's deceased spouse;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The parent of the respondent;</p>
                  <p>(v) An adult child of the respondent;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A person named in the will of the respondent's deceased parent;</p>
                  <p>(vii) A relative of the respondent with whom the respondent has resided for more than six (6) months during the year preceding the filing of the petition;</p>
                  <p>(viii) A relative or friend who has demonstrated a sincere, longstanding interest in the welfare of the respondent;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Any other person whose appointment would be in the best interests of the respondent;</p>
                  <p>(x) A person with a guardianship program for incompetent persons.</p>
                  <p>(d) Subject to subsection (e) of this section, qualified persons have priority for appointment as guardian of a minor in the following order:</p>
                  <p>(i) The parent or parents of the minor;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The person nominated as guardian in the will of the custodial parent;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The person requested by a minor who has reached the age of fourteen (14) years;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any other person whose appointment would be in the best interests of the minor.</p>
                  <p>(e) The court shall consider the priorities established in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, but shall not be bound by those priorities. The court shall appoint the person who is best qualified and willing to serve as guardian.</p>

                  <p>(a) All claims against the ward shall be filed in duplicate with the clerk of the court in which the conservatorship was created. If only one (1) copy of a claim is filed, the clerk shall make a duplicate and shall charge the claimant a reasonable fee.</p>
                  <p>(b) The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the conservator one (1) copy of each claim filed.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any claim not in excess of two hundred dollars ($200.00) may be allowed by the conservator without the filing of the claim by the creditor. The conservator is accountable to the court for paying a claim under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(d) Valid contract claims arising in the ordinary course of the conduct of the business or affairs of the ward by the conservator may be paid by the conservator without requiring affidavit or filing.</p>

                  <p>(a) When a claim is filed with the clerk it shall be supported by satisfactory vouchers or other evidence supporting the claim, and by the affidavit of the claimant or someone in his behalf that the account is justly due, or if it is not due, when it will or may become due, that no payments have been made thereon which are not credited, and that there are no offsets to the claim to the knowledge of the affiant. If the claim is not due when filed or is contingent, an explanation of the claim shall be stated.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the claim is founded on a bond, bill, note or other instrument, a copy of the instrument shall accompany the claim. The original instrument shall be exhibited to the conservator if demanded, unless it is lost or destroyed, in which case the claimant shall accompany his claim by his affidavit containing a copy or particular description of the instrument and stating its loss or destruction. If the claim, or any part thereof, is secured by a mortgage or other lien which has been recorded or filed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the land or property affected by it is situate, it is sufficient to describe the mortgage or lien and refer to the date, filing number and volume and page of its record.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the conservator is a creditor of the ward, he shall file his claim as other creditors and the court shall appoint a competent person as temporary conservator to represent the ward in the matter allowing or disallowing the claim. The same procedure shall be followed in the case of joint conservators, where all of the conservators are creditors of the ward. If one (1) of the joint conservators is not a creditor of the ward, the disinterested conservator shall represent the ward in the matter of allowing or disallowing the claim against the estate by a conservator.</p>
                  <p>(b) The temporary conservator shall investigate the claim and report his findings to the court and his recommendation whether the claim should be allowed or disallowed. If the court disallows the claim, it shall be treated as a rejected claim.</p>

                  <p>(a) The filing of a claim in the conservatorship tolls the statute of limitations applicable to the claim until the claim is rejected by the conservator.</p>
                  <p>(b) It is within the discretion of the conservator to determine whether or not the applicable statute of limitations shall be invoked to bar a claim which he believes to be just, and his decision as to invoking the statute shall be final.</p>

                  <p>(a) No claimant may compel payment of his claim until it has been duly filed and allowed by the conservator or reduced to judgment and a certified copy of the judgment filed with the clerk.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any judgment rendered upon any claim for money only establishes the claim as if it had been allowed by the conservator. The judgment shall order that the conservator pay the amount adjudged to be due, to the extent of assets available, to satisfy claims against the ward, augmented by any liability insurance proceeds available as to the claim.</p>
                  <p>(c) If judgment is for the recovery of real or personal property or the enforcement of lien thereon, no execution shall issue until ten (10) days after a certified copy of the judgment has been filed with the clerk.</p>

                  <p>(a) When a judgment has been entered against the ward prior to the appointment of a conservator, no execution shall issue thereon after the conservator is appointed unless the judgment is for the recovery of real or personal property or the enforcement of a lien. A judgment against the ward for the recovery of money shall be filed with the clerk as any other claim. If execution is levied upon any property of the ward before the appointment of a conservator, the property may be sold for the satisfaction of the judgment and the officer making the sale shall account to the conservator for any surplus realized from the sale.</p>
                  <p>(b) A judgment rendered against a ward for whom a conservator is appointed after verdict or decision on an issue of fact, but before judgment is entered, shall be filed with the clerk as any other claim.</p>
                  <p>(c) No execution shall issue upon nor any levy be made against any property of the estate of a ward under any judgment against the ward or conservator, unless the judgment is for the recovery of real or personal property or the enforcement of a lien.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section shall not be construed to prevent the enforcement of a mortgage, pledge or other lien upon property in an appropriate proceeding.</p>

                  <p>When it appears the assets of the ward are insufficient to pay in full all claims against the ward, the conservator shall report the relevant facts to the court. The court shall, upon hearing, with notice to all persons who have filed claims, order the pro rata payment of claims giving claimants the same priority, if any, as they would have if the ward were not under conservatorship. Priority of payment shall be given to court costs and other costs of administration of the conservatorship.</p>

The investments, except those provided in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection hereof, shall be made only upon the prior approval of the court, after notice to the veterans' administration as provided in W.S. 3-6-110, as amended:</p>

                <p>(ii) The bonds of this state or of any other state, or any county, school districts, city, or town in the United States with a population of not less than one thousand (1,000) inhabitants; and where the laws do not permit such counties, cities, school districts, or towns to become indebted in excess of six percent (6%) of the assessed valuation of property for taxation therein, and where the total indebtedness of such county, school districts, city, or municipality, does not exceed six percent (6%) of the assessed valuation of property for taxation at the time of such investment: provided always, there has been no default for more than thirty (30) days during the preceding ten (10) years upon any bonds of the issuing state, county, city or town;</p>

                  <p>(ii) On the date the petition is filed, this state is a significant-connection state and:</p>
                  <p>(A) The respondent does not have a home state or a court of the respondent's home state has declined to exercise jurisdiction because this state is a more appropriate forum; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The respondent has a home state, a petition for an appointment or order is not pending in a court of that state or another significant-connection state, and before the court makes the appointment or issues the order:</p>
                  <p>(I) A petition for an appointment or order is not filed in the respondent's home state;</p>
                  <p>(II) An objection to the court's jurisdiction is not filed by a person required to be notified of the proceeding; and</p>

                  <p>(iii) This state does not have jurisdiction under either paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subsection, the respondent's home state and all significant connection states have declined to exercise jurisdiction because this state is the more appropriate forum, and jurisdiction in this state is consistent with the constitutions of this state and the United States; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) The requirements for special jurisdiction under W.S. 3-8-204 are met.</p>

                  <p>(a) A court of this state having jurisdiction under W.S. 3-8-203 to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order may decline to exercise its jurisdiction if it determines at any time that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Whether abuse, neglect or exploitation of the respondent has occurred or is likely to occur and which state could best protect the respondent from the abuse, neglect or exploitation;</p>

                  <p>(a) If at any time a court of this state determines that it acquired jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order because of unjustifiable conduct, the court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Decline to exercise jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Exercise jurisdiction for the limited purpose of fashioning an appropriate remedy to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the respondent or the protection of the respondent's property or prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a petition for the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a protective order is filed in a court of another state having jurisdiction; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Continue to exercise jurisdiction after considering:</p>
                  <p>(A) The extent to which the respondent and all persons required to be notified of the proceedings have acquiesced in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(B) Whether it is a more appropriate forum than the court of any other state under the factors set forth in W.S. 3-8-206(c); and</p>
                  <p>(C) Whether the court of any other state would have jurisdiction under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional standards of W.S. 3-8-203.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a court of this state determines that it acquired jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order because a party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction engaged in unjustifiable conduct, it may assess against that party necessary and reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, investigative fees, court costs, communication expenses, witness fees and expenses and travel expenses. The court may not assess fees, costs or expenses of any kind against this state or a governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality of this state unless authorized by law other than this act.</p>

                  <p>(e) The court shall issue a final order accepting the proceeding and appointing the guardian or conservator as guardian or conservator in this state upon its receipt from the court from which the proceeding is being transferred of a final order issued under provisions similar to W.S. 3-8-301 transferring the proceeding to this state.</p>
                  <p>(f) Not later than ninety (90) days after issuance of a final order accepting transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship, the court shall determine whether the guardianship or conservatorship needs to be modified to conform to the law of this state.</p>

                  <p>(b) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a future event or contingency, the principal, in the power of attorney, may authorize one (1) or more persons to determine in a writing or other record that the event or contingency has occurred.</p>

                  <p>(vi) Principal revokes the agent's authority or the agent dies, becomes incapacitated or resigns and the power of attorney does not provide for another agent to act under the power of attorney.</p>

                  <p>(e) Incapacity of the principal of a power of attorney that is not durable does not revoke or terminate the power of attorney as to an agent or other person that, without actual knowledge of the incapacity, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest.</p>
                  <p>(f) The execution of a power of attorney does not revoke a power of attorney previously executed by the principal unless the subsequent power of attorney provides that the previous power of attorney is revoked or that all other powers of attorney are revoked.</p>
