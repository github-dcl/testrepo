                <p>(c) An employer that has employees who are employed in Wyoming and any other state and who transmits the report required under subsection (b) of this section by electronic or magnetic means may elect to submit the report to either state in accordance with federal law.

                <p>(i) "Employee" means an individual eighteen (18) years of age or older who is an employee within the meaning of chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, but does not include an employee of a federal or state agency performing intelligence or counter-intelligence functions if the head of such agency has determined that reporting the information required by this section could endanger the safety of the individual or compromise an ongoing investigation or intelligence operation. If the federal government seeks to impose sanctions on Wyoming for failure to report new hires under eighteen (18) years of age, the department may include such individuals within the definition of employee for purposes of this section;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Employer" means as defined in section 3401(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and includes any governmental agency and any labor organization;</p>

                <p>(e) In the event that the federal law requiring the state to maintain a directory of new hires is repealed, employers shall not be required to submit reports as provided by subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The state shall not thereafter maintain the directory of new hires required under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) The department is the custodian of the fund and shall administer the fund and issue warrants upon the fund in accordance with the directions of the department or regulations of the commission. The state treasurer shall maintain a clearing account, an unemployment trust fund account and a benefit account separately within the fund as specified by the department.</p>
                  <p>(b) All funds payable to the fund shall be deposited by the department or its authorized representative in the clearing account, with receipt and acknowledgement submitted to the state treasurer. In addition, all funds collected from the employment support fund under W.S. 27-3-505(a) shall be deposited by the department in the clearing account, for clearance only, and shall not become a part of the fund. After clearance, funds collected for the employment support fund under W.S. 27-3-505(a) shall be deposited in the employment support fund created by W.S. 27-3-211. Thereafter, refunds payable pursuant to W.S. 27-3-515 may be paid from the clearing account upon warrants issued by the state auditor under regulation of the commission. Remaining funds in the clearing account shall be immediately deposited with the United States secretary of the treasury in Wyoming's account within the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1104(e).</p>

Withdrawals from the unemployment trust fund shall not exceed the balance of Wyoming's account within the trust fund. Upon receipt, the department shall deposit the funds in the benefit account, with receipt and acknowledgement submitted to the state treasurer, and shall issue warrants for the payment of benefits from the benefit account. Any funds remaining unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which they were withdrawn shall be deducted from estimates and used for the payment of benefits during succeeding periods or deposited with the United States secretary of the treasury in Wyoming's account in the unemployment trust fund.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided by this act, the department may deposit funds of the clearing and benefit accounts, under regulation of the commission and separate from other state funds, in an approved public depository in the manner provided by W.S. 9-4-801 through 9-4-815. Any collateral pledged for this purpose shall be separate from collateral pledged to secure other state funds. All funds recovered from losses sustained by the fund shall be deposited into the fund. The department may request an examination of any return or report of a national banking association required by this act pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 3305(c).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-3-303. Weekly amount; computation; payment.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the weekly benefit amount for an eligible individual is four percent (4%) of his total wages payable for insured work in that quarter of his base period in which his wages were highest computed to the next lower multiple of one dollar ($1.00). The amount shall not be more than the statewide weekly wage multiplied by fifty-five percent (55%) and computed to the next lower multiple of one dollar ($1.00). The statewide weekly wage is the total wages reported by employers, excluding the limitation on the amount of wages subject to contributions under this act, for employment during the calendar year preceding June 1 divided by the product of fifty-two (52) times the twelve (12) month average of the number of employees in the pay period and rounded to the nearest cent. The statewide average annual wage is the total wages reported by employers, excluding the limitation on the amount of wages subject to contributions under this act, for employment during the calendar year preceding June 1 divided by the twelve (12) month average of the number of employees in the pay period and rounded to the nearest cent. The pay period reported by employers shall include the twelfth day of each month during the same year. The minimum and maximum weekly benefit paid under this subsection to any individual applies only to the benefit year beginning on or after July 1.</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed by Laws 1985, ch. 175, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(c) An eligible individual unemployed in any week shall be paid his weekly benefit for that week less any earnings payable to him for that week which exceeds fifty percent (50%) of his weekly benefit amount. The reported earnings and resulting payment shall be computed to the next lower multiple of one dollar ($1.00).</p>
                  <p>(d) Effective April 1, 1984, and any other time thereafter, when the revenues in the fund excluding legislative appropriations and interfund borrowing are certified by the governor to be inadequate to pay the benefits computed as provided in subsection (a) of this section and inadequate to repay interfund or federal loans, the weekly benefit of any individual whose benefits computed under subsection (a) of this section would equal or exceed ninety dollars ($90.00) per week shall be reduced to eighty-five percent (85%) of that computed under subsection (a) of this section rounded to the next lower multiple of one dollar ($1.00). No individual receiving benefits of ninety dollars ($90.00) or more per week shall receive less than ninety dollars ($90.00) per week because of the reduction provided under this subsection. The reduced benefits shall continue until the governor and the state treasurer certify to the department that the fund is adequately solvent to pay the benefits computed under subsection (a) of this section. A reduction in an individual's weekly benefit amount resulting from the imposition of this provision will not increase the number of full weeks of benefits to which the individual would otherwise have been entitled had the provision not been invoked. The amounts paid under this subsection shall be in complete satisfaction of a claimant's rights and benefits under this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon periodic certification by the governor to the state treasurer of inadequate revenues, the state treasurer may authorize interfund loans from the legislative stabilization reserve account for cumulative amounts not exceeding twenty million dollars ($20,000,000.00), to the unemployment compensation fund as needed to repay revenues borrowed pursuant to W.S. 27-3-208 or to pay benefits through January 1, 1995, which are not able to be paid due to the insufficiency of any available revenues except for those obtained through W.S. 27-3-208. Loans pursuant to this subsection shall bear interest at the interest rate earned on pooled fund investments in the previous fiscal year and shall be repaid when the unemployment compensation fund is adequately solvent to repay the loans and to continue paying the benefit obligations.</p>

If the individual owes child support obligations and is eligible for benefits, the department shall notify the state or local child support enforcement agency operating pursuant to a plan described in 42 U.S.C. § 654 and enforcing the obligation that the individual is eligible for benefits.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department shall withhold from benefits payable to an individual owing child support obligations enforced pursuant to a plan approved under 42 U.S.C. § 651, et seq.:</p>

                  <p>(c) Any amount withheld under subsection (b) of this section shall be paid by the department to the appropriate state or local child support enforcement agency, treated as if paid to the individual as benefits under this act and as if paid by the individual to the state or local child support enforcement agency in satisfaction of his child support obligations.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section applies only if arrangements are made for reimbursement by the state or local child support enforcement agency for administrative costs incurred by the department attributable to child support obligations enforced by the agency and if the obligations are being enforced pursuant to a plan approved under 42 U.S.C. § 651, et seq.</p>

                  <p>(i) Total or part total unemployment for any week is due to work stoppage resulting from a labor dispute on the employment premises at which he was last employed.

                  <p>(a) An extended benefit period begins with the third week following a week in which there is a state "on" indicator and ends with the third week after the first week in which there is a state "off" indicator or the thirteenth consecutive week of the extended benefit period, whichever occurs later. An extended benefit period may not begin until the fourteenth week following the end of a prior extended benefit period.</p>
                  <p>(b) A state "on" indicator for a week exists if the insured unemployment rate under this act for that week and the preceding twelve (12) weeks is equal to or greater than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the average rates for the corresponding thirteen (13) week period ending in each of the preceding two (2) calendar years and is equal to or greater than five percent (5%). A state "off" indicator for a week exists if either of the conditions for the existence of a state "on" indicator is not satisfied for that week and the preceding twelve (12) weeks. The insured unemployment rate under this subsection is the average weekly number of individuals filing unemployment claims for regular compensation in this state for the most recent thirteen (13) consecutive week period divided by the average monthly employment covered under this act for the first four (4) of the most recent six (6) completed calendar quarters ending before the end of the thirteen (13) week period.

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided by this article and regulation of the commission, regular benefit claim and payment provisions of this act apply to extended benefits.</p>
                  <p>(b) An eligible individual's weekly extended benefit amount for a week of total unemployment in his eligibility period is equal to his weekly benefit amount payable during the applicable benefit year except as hereafter provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the amount of extended benefits reimbursed by the federal government under the federal-state extended unemployment compensation act is reduced or increased, then an eligible claimant's weekly and potential maximum extended benefit amount shall be similarly reduced or increased by an amount sufficient to assure that the federal government and the state of Wyoming share the cost on an equal basis. The reduced weekly extended benefit amount, if not a full dollar amount, shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of one dollar ($1.00);</p>
                  <p>(ii) The provisions in W.S. 27-3-509(c) which determine the reimbursable rate of certain employers shall not be affected by paragraph (i) of this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Thirteen (13) times his weekly benefit amount under this article for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year. A reduction in an eligible claimant's weekly and potential maximum extended benefit amount, resulting from the application of paragraph (b)(i) of this section, will not increase the number of weeks of extended benefit entitlement beyond that specified in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act and if the benefit year of an individual ends within an extended benefit period, the remaining balance of extended benefits the individual is otherwise entitled to receive in that extended benefit period for unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year shall be reduced by the product of the number of weeks he received an amount as trade readjustment allowances within that benefit year multiplied by his weekly extended benefit amount. Extended benefits shall not be reduced below zero by reason of this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(a) Benefits shall be paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination or decision until modified or reversed by a subsequent or pending redetermination or decision. A proceeding for judicial review under this article shall not operate as a supersedeas or stay nor shall the commission or the court issue an injunction, supersedeas, stay or other writ or process suspending the payment of benefits. Except as provided in W.S. 27-3-506(e), if a determination, redetermination or decision is reversed or modified, an employer's account shall not be charged for benefits paid under an erroneous determination and benefits shall be paid or denied in accordance with the modifying or reversing redetermination or decision.</p>
                  <p>(b) An individual receiving benefits under this act to which he is not entitled shall be liable for and repay the benefit. Repayment of the benefits shall be had by any combination of recoupment, recovery by civil action, offset through the treasury offset program of the United States treasury, 26 U.S.C. Section 6402(f), or voluntary reimbursement agreement:</p>
                  <p>(i) The department in its discretion, may recoup the benefit amount liable to be repaid by offsetting, without civil action, against future benefits payable to the individual under this act within five (5) years from the effective date of the claim resulting in the overpayment if the claim was not fraudulent. If the claim resulting in the overpayment was fraudulent, the five (5) year limit on recoupment shall not apply. The department shall waive recoupment if an individual is without fault in receiving the benefits and it defeats the purpose of this act or is against equity and good conscience as considered by the department in accordance with regulations of the commission;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The department may also recover overpaid benefits from an individual by civil action brought in the name of the department;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department in its discretion, without civil action, may accept repayment of overpaid benefits by reimbursement from an individual pursuant to a payment schedule approved by the department.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department may recoup or recover overpayment of benefits to any individual under another state law if a state certifies to the department the facts involved, the overpaid individual is liable for repayment of benefits and the state requests the department to do so. Repayment either by recoupment or recovery shall be had pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Repayment shall be equal to the amount of overpayment determined by the requesting state.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any overpayment of benefits fraudulently received shall be assessed a penalty equal to twenty percent (20%) of the amount of overpayment and an additional five percent (5%) penalty on the remaining unpaid balance at the end of every six (6) months. One-fourth (1/4) of the amounts collected pursuant to the initial penalty and all of the additional penalties shall be paid into the employment security revenue account and the department shall utilize those collected amounts for administrative costs of overpayment collection, fraud investigation, developing and providing educational programs for this act. Three-fourths (3/4) of the amounts collected pursuant to the initial penalty shall be paid into the unemployment trust fund account.

                  <p>(a) Upon its own motion or application of an employing unit and after notice and opportunity for hearing, the department may determine if an employing unit is an employer and if services performed for the employing unit qualify as employment. The department shall consider employment occurring during a ten (10) year period preceding the date of employer determination. A determination by the department is final as to the employing unit fifteen (15) days after mailing its findings and determination to the employing unit. The employing unit may appeal a determination in accordance with W.S. 27-3-506.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as provided by subsection (d) of this section, an employing unit qualifying as an employer within any year is subject to this act for that entire calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(c) An employer enumerated under this subsection may apply in writing to the department before January 31 for termination of coverage under this act for that calendar year. The department may waive the application filing requirement for good cause. Employers to which this subsection applies include:</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 1999, ch. 73, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(ii) An agricultural employer paying wages of less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) each quarter during the preceding calendar year or employing less than ten (10) workers on any day of twenty (20) or more different weeks within a calendar year;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A domestic employer paying wages of less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in each quarter of the preceding calendar year;</p>

                  <p>(d) An employing unit not qualifying as an employer or for which services not qualifying as employment are performed may elect coverage under this act for a period of not less than two (2) years by filing written notice of its election with the department. If the department approves the election in writing, coverage is effective on the date of approval. Application for termination of coverage as an employer under this subsection shall be filed in writing with the department not less than thirty (30) days before January 1 of any year following the initial two (2) years of coverage and for termination of coverage of employment, not less than thirty (30) days after January 1. The department may terminate coverage under this subsection for good cause by giving notice to the employer.</p>
                  <p>(e) An employing unit shall maintain accurate employment records containing information prescribed by the commission. Records shall be open to inspection by and submitted to the department upon request. An employing unit shall submit reports on employees upon request of the department or an appeal tribunal.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any employing unit subject to this act shall not commence business or engage in work within this state without registering under this act and otherwise complying with this act. A prime or general contractor subcontracting any part of a contract shall require notification and compliance by any subcontractor under this subsection before awarding a contract or permitting a subcontractor to begin work. The state, a county, municipality or any other political subdivision shall require the prime or general contractor to register and comply with this act before authorizing the contractor to begin work under any public contract. The secretary of state shall report to the department the names and addresses of all business entities registering with that agency during the preceding month. The Wyoming department of transportation and the department of administration and information shall report to the department the names and addresses of business entities awarded a contract by that agency during the preceding month. Any employing unit failing to comply with this subsection or W.S. 27-3-510(c) or (d) or delinquent for filing reports or paying contributions required under this act may be enjoined by the department from engaging or continuing in business subject to this act until required reports are filed or payments are made and the unit otherwise complies with this act. All costs of the action including a reasonable attorney fee shall be paid by the employing unit against which the injunction is sought. In addition to the penalties and remedies provided by W.S. 27-3-510 through 27-3-512 and 27-3-704, the department may assess and collect an additional fee of up to three (3) times the amount of delinquent contributions payable under this act for any employing unit failing to comply with this subsection. This additional fee is part of the payment due for all purposes if an action is instituted under this subsection. If the employing unit is a subcontractor, the general contractor or the project owner may be held liable for payment of the contributions and any additional assessment due.</p>
                  <p>(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act:</p>
                  <p>(i) A service supplier is the employing unit of the worker provided to the client and shall be liable to pay the contributions on wages paid by it to the worker performing services for the client;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If an entity is not a service supplier as defined by W.S. 27-3-501(a)(viii) or if the client pays wages to the worker directly, then the client is the employing unit of the worker and shall be liable to pay the contributions on wages paid by it to the worker performing services for the client;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an entity pays the worker and that entity is not the employing unit of the worker as determined herein, that entity is deemed the agent of the employing unit so determined;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If the service supplier fails to pay all contributions or submit required reports which are due, then the client shall be jointly and severally liable for those which are attributable to wages for services performed for the client by the worker provided by the service supplier;</p>
                  <p>(v) The service supplier shall keep separate records, submit a list of all clients to the department on a quarterly basis and submit separate quarterly reports for each client;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Repealed By Laws 2007, Ch. 177, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(vii) A temporary service contractor is the employing unit of the temporary worker provided to an employer and shall be liable to pay the contributions on wages paid by the temporary service contractor to the temporary worker performing services for the employer.</p>
                  <p>(h) If an employing unit fails to comply with an injunction order issued under subsection (f) of this section, the department may file with the district court of the county in which the employing unit resides, conducts business or may be found, a verified application showing that the employing unit received notice of an injunction order and has failed to comply with its terms. Upon receipt of the department's application, the court shall provide the employing unit with an opportunity for a hearing within twenty (20) days. Upon finding that the employing unit has violated the department's injunction, the court may issue an order directing the employing unit, including any partners or corporate officers, to comply with the injunction order and may assess a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each day of violation. Any officer or director having at least twenty percent (20%) ownership interest of a corporate employing unit, who controls or supervises filing contribution reports or making payment contributions under this act and who willfully fails to file the reports or make required payments, may be held jointly and severally liable for the contributions and interest due from the employing unit. In any court proceeding for the enforcement of an injunction order, the department shall not be required to show that it lacks adequate legal remedy or is suffering irreparable harm due to the violation of the injunction order.</p>
                  <p>Any employing unit failing to comply with an order of the court issued under this subsection may be cited for contempt.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-3-503. Payment; base rate; failure to pay; rate variations; benefit ratio; new employer rate; special reserve rate.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Employment wage contributions imposed under this section are payable by employers subject to this act. Contributions shall be paid to the department for the fund in accordance with regulations of the commission and shall not be deducted from employee wages.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the base rate of contributions assigned to any employer is eight and one-half percent (8.5%) for 1988 and each calendar year thereafter subject to rate variations under subsections (d) and (f) of this section in addition to the adjustment factors computed under W.S. 27-3-505. Except as hereafter provided, a contributing employer failing to pay all contributions, interest and penalties or to submit all quarterly contribution reports due on his account or any account assumed under W.S. 27-3-507 on or before September 30 preceding the effective date of his assigned rate shall be assigned a delinquent rate which shall include a two percent (2%) tax rate increase in his base rate and shall also include in addition thereto the adjustment factors for the next calendar year beginning January 1. The delinquent rate shall not exceed the maximum assignable rate. The delinquent rate shall continue to be assigned through and including the calendar quarter in which the delinquent employer satisfies his delinquent account by paying all contributions, interest and penalties due and submitting all contribution reports due. Upon satisfaction of the delinquent account, the contributing employer shall be assigned the contribution rate otherwise applicable under this article beginning the next full calendar quarter. Provided however, that a delinquent employer shall pay an assigned delinquent rate for at least the first quarter even if the account is satisfied before January 1 of the new calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon reviewing the account of a delinquent employer, the department may eliminate or reduce contributions payable due to the two percent (2%) delinquency tax rate increase imposed under subsection (b) of this section either upon a showing of good cause, or a finding that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The delinquency is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00);</p>
                  <p>(ii) After notice of the changed rate, the employer protested his delinquency tax rate in writing to the department pursuant to W.S. 27-3-506(b);</p>
                  <p>(iii) All delinquent amounts are paid by December 31 preceding the calendar year for which the delinquent rate has been assigned; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) All delinquent wage records are submitted.</p>
                  <p>(d) Rate variations from the base rate of contributions based upon the employer's benefit ratio shall be assigned to eligible employers each calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Benefit ratios shall be computed for those employers whose accounts have been chargeable for benefits throughout the employer's experience period. An employer's benefit ratio shall be the contribution rate provided his rate is not more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) in addition to the adjustment factors computed under W.S. 27-3-505. Benefit ratios shall be computed to the fourth decimal on the basis of the experience period preceding the calculation date of the rate.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any new employer not previously subject to this act or having no established experience period shall pay contributions at a rate equal to the average rate of contributions paid by his major industrial classification for the calendar year preceding the year in which he first employed workers in this state in addition to the adjustment factors computed under W.S. 27-3-505. In no case, however, will any new employer be assigned a rate of less than one percent (1%), plus the adjustment factors computed under W.S. 27-3-505. This rate shall be adjusted annually and the rate shall remain in effect until the employer has established an experience period in accordance with this article. The commission shall by rule and regulation develop the major industrial classifications for the state and the department shall annually determine the contribution rate for each classification based upon contributions paid during the preceding calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(g) Repealed by Laws 2003, Ch. 123, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any employer subject to this act solely due to having met the liability requirements under W.S. 27-3-105(a)(ii), 27-3-107(c) or (g) for the first time during the preceding calendar year shall be exempt from the delinquent rate provisions in subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent year, provided the employer has submitted all reports and contributions by April 30 of the subsequent year.</p>
                  <p>(j) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, upon full satisfaction of an employer's delinquent account and at the written request of the employer, the department may, for good cause shown, reduce or eliminate the additional amounts payable as a result of the two percent (2%) delinquency rate.</p>

                  <p>(a) Separate accounts shall be maintained for each employer and benefits paid to an individual shall be charged to the account of his base period employer.</p>
                  <p>(b) If an individual is employed by two (2) or more employers during his base period, the base period employer's account shall be charged an amount bearing the same ratio to total benefits paid to the individual as the amount of wages payable by the employer bears to total wages payable by all employers during the individual's base period.</p>

If, however, the benefits are paid by another state, the amount chargeable to employers in this state for whom the individual was previously employed, shall be the amount reimbursed by this state to the paying state.

                  <p><shortTitle>27-3-505. Adjustment for noncharged and ineffectively charged benefits; adjustment for positive and negative fund balance; computations; exception; maximum rate.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An adjustment factor for noncharged and ineffectively charged benefits shall be computed to the fourth decimal by dividing the total noncharged and ineffectively charged benefits to all employers' experience rating accounts during the experience rating period ending June 30 by the total taxable wages payable during the experience period and added to the rate provided by W.S. 27-3-503. The total taxable wages payable under this subsection shall not include wages payable by employers electing payments instead of contributions under W.S. 27-3-509. Sixty percent (60%) of this adjustment factor shall be allocated to the unemployment compensation fund. Forty percent (40%) of this adjustment factor shall be allocated to the employment support fund created by W.S. 27-3-211.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the fund balance on October 31 of the year immediately preceding the calendar year for which the contribution rate is being computed is less than three and one- half percent (3 \xBD%) of the total payrolls reported to the department by September 30 for that year ending June 30, a positive fund balance adjustment factor shall be computed. The adjustment factor shall be computed annually to the fourth decimal by dividing the total reported taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the year immediately preceding the calendar year for which the contribution rate is being computed, into a sum equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the difference between the amount in the fund on October 31 of the same year and five percent (5%) of the total payrolls for that year ending June 30. The adjustment factor shall be effective until the fund balance on October 31 of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the contribution rate equals three and one- half percent (3 \xBD%) or more of the total payrolls for that year ending June 30. The department shall by rule and regulation establish an additional formula to apportion the positive fund balance adjustment factor between those employers whose accounts have incurred a benefit ratio, pursuant to W.S. 27-3-503(e), of zero (0) and those employers whose accounts have incurred a benefit ratio that is greater than zero (0). For purposes of the apportionment, those employers having no established experience period pursuant to W.S. 27-3-503(f) shall be treated the same as those employers whose accounts have incurred a benefit ratio that is greater than zero (0). The apportionment formula shall reflect:</p>
                  <p>(i) The proportion of contribution revenue received from each of the two (2) groups of employers during the previous calendar year;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An additional surcharge for employers whose accounts have incurred a benefit ratio that is greater than zero (0).</p>
                  <p>(c) If the fund balance on October 31 of the year immediately preceding the calendar year for which the contribution rate is being computed exceeds four percent (4%) of the total payrolls reported to the department by September 30 for that year ending June 30, a negative fund balance adjustment factor shall be computed. The negative adjustment factor shall be computed annually to the fourth decimal by dividing the total reported taxable payrolls for the year ending June 30 of the year immediately preceding the calendar year for which the contribution rate is being computed, into a sum equal to twenty- five percent (25%) of the difference between the amount in the fund as of October 31 of the same year and four percent (4%) of the total payrolls for that year ending June 30. The adjustment factor shall be effective until the fund balance on October 31 of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the contribution rate is equal to or less than four percent (4%) of the total payrolls for that year ending June 30.</p>
                  <p>(d) The adjustment factors computed pursuant to this section are separate from an employer's experience rating, shall be algebraically added to the employer's contribution rate and payable by each employer subject to this article. The adjustment factor computed under subsection (c) of this section shall be algebraically added only to the contribution rate of those employers eligible for an experience rating. The adjustment factors applied to an employer's contribution rate shall not be less than zero (0).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-3-506. Notice of rates and charges; relief, review or redetermination.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The department shall notify an employer of his contribution rate determined pursuant to this article and of total benefit charges to his account within a reasonable time after the close of each experience period. A base period employer shall be notified of the filing of all initial claims which may be charged to his account. Except as otherwise provided by the legislature and on or before January 1 of each year, the department shall notify each employer of his projected contributions payable under W.S. 27-3-503 and 27-3-505 for the ensuing calendar year. Notice under this section shall be by mail to the last known address of record.</p>
                  <p>(b) A determination of contribution rates by the department for any calendar year is binding upon the employer unless within thirty (30) days after notice is mailed, he files an application for review and redetermination in accordance with this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) An employer may apply in writing to the department within twenty-eight (28) days after the mailing or delivery of notice of benefits charged to his account for relief of benefit charges under W.S. 27-3-504(e)(i), (ii), (iv) or (viii). The application shall state the reasons for relief. Determinations of benefits not charged to an employer's account and which are paid from the trust fund shall be recorded and shall specify the reasons therefor. The records are open to inspection by an employer or his legal representative.</p>
                  <p>(d) An employer may apply to the department for review of a decision or determination involving contribution liability, contribution rates or the charging of benefit payments under W.S. 27-3-509. The application shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for review. The department, on behalf of the commission, shall notify the employer of its acceptance or denial of the application for review or of a redetermination by the commission. If the commission grants review, the employer shall be given opportunity for hearing in accordance with W.S. 27-3-401 through 27-3-409 to the extent not inconsistent with this article. An employer in any proceeding involving contribution rates or liability may not contest benefits paid and charged to his account in accordance with a determination, redetermination or decision pursuant to W.S. 27-3-401 through 27-3-409 unless he was not a party to the proceeding. A denial or redetermination is final unless within thirty (30) days after notice is mailed a petition for judicial review is filed in accordance with W.S. 27-3-407.</p>
                  <p>(e) An employer's account shall not be relieved of charges relating to a payment that was made erroneously from the unemployment compensation fund after July 1, 2013 if the department determines that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The erroneous payment was made because the employer, or the agent of the employer, was at fault for failing to respond timely or adequately to a written request, sent by United States mail or by electronic mail, from the department for information relating to the claim for benefits which resulted in the erroneous payment; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The employer or agent has established a pattern of failing to respond timely or adequately to requests similar to those identified in paragraph (i) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(f) For purposes of subsection (e) of this section, "timely" means within fifteen (15) days after a notice or request is sent by United States mail or by electronic mail to the address of record of the employer or employer's agent. The department shall acknowledge receipt of the requested information within fifteen (15) days, if requested by the employer or the employer's agent. Acknowledgment shall be by United States mail or electronic mail.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-3-507. Person acquiring trade of employing unit; transfer of experience and assignment of rates.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A person acquiring the trade, organization, business or substantially all the assets of an employer subject to this act shall assume the employer's account, benefit experience and contribution rate. If the acquiring person is an employer subject to this act, the department shall consolidate the separate accounts and benefit experience and shall determine the contribution rate of the acquiring person effective the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of acquisition.</p>
                  <p>A delinquency rate shall be assumed by the acquiring person as provided in W.S. 27-3-503(b) when the acquiring person owned or controlled an interest in the transferring employer or if the acquiring person is a member of the immediate family of the transferring employer.</p>
                  <p>(b) The transfer of some or all of an employer's workforce to another person shall be considered a transfer of trade or business when, as a result of the transfer, the transferring employer no longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred workforce, and the trade or business is performed by the person to whom the workforce is transferred.</p>
                  <p>(c) If an employer transfers all or a portion of its trade or business to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management or control of the two (2) employers, then the unemployment insurance experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom the business is transferred. The rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective the first day of the calendar quarter immediately following the date of the transfer of trade or business. Both employers may be given a delinquency rate as provided in W.S. 27-3-503(b) if applicable.</p>
                  <p>(d) If, following a transfer of experience under this section, the department determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of the trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, then the accounts of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and a single rate assigned to the account.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a person is not an employer under this section at the time the person acquires the trade or business of an employer, the unemployment insurance experience of the acquired employer shall not be transferred to the person if the department finds that the person acquired the trade or business of the employer solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. Instead, the person shall be assigned the applicable new employer rate under W.S. 27-3-503(b). In determining whether the trade or business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the department shall use objective factors which may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long the business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.</p>
                  <p>(f) The department shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a business for purposes of this section and W.S. 27-3-706.</p>

                  <p>A joint venture composed of two (2) or more employers with accounts meeting the requirements of W.S. 27-3-503(b) and (c) shall apply in writing to the department within four (4) months after the date of formation of the joint venture for determination of a contribution rate. The department shall, upon receipt of application and pursuant to this article, assign a contribution rate based upon the benefit ratio computed on the consolidation of the separate accounts and benefit experiences of the employers for the experience period. The contribution rate shall be determined and assigned by the department to the joint venture each calendar year until its separate account and benefit experience qualify as an experience period.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-3-509. Election of substitute payments by certain organizations authorized; filing and liability period; billing; posting of security; exceptions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An organization or nonprofit organization defined by W.S. 27-3-501(a)(v) and (vi) and subject to this act may instead of paying contributions otherwise required by this article, elect to pay an amount determined pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. If an organization or nonprofit organization elects payment liability at the time it is determined an employer subject to this act, it shall file written notice of its election with the department not later than thirty (30) days following the date of determination. Liability for payments shall be at least one (1) year from the date of determination and shall continue until written notice is filed with the department terminating its election. Notice shall be filed not later than thirty (30) days before the beginning of the taxable year for which the termination is effective. An organization or nonprofit organization previously paying contributions under this act may file written notice of election for payment liability with the department not later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of any taxable year. The election shall not be changed for at least two (2) years from the effective date.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department may for good cause extend the required filing period for notice of election or termination and may permit an election to be retroactive to January 1 of the year in which the election is made. It shall notify an organization of its determination of employer status, the effective date of an election and a termination of election. Determinations are subject to reconsideration, appeal and review in accordance with W.S. 27-3-506.</p>
                  <p>(c) At the end of each calendar quarter or other period determined by the department, the department shall bill each nonprofit organization electing payment liability under this section for an amount equal to the total amount of regular benefits plus one-half (1/2) of the amount of extended benefits paid during the quarter or other prescribed period attributable to employment in the nonprofit organization. An organization electing payment liability under this section shall be billed in a similar manner for an amount equal to the total amount of extended benefits attributable to employment by the organization during the billing period. Payment shall be made not later than thirty (30) days after the bill is mailed or delivered unless an application for review and redetermination is filed. Payments shall not be deducted from employee wages and if not paid when due, the employer is subject to interest under this article. The department shall notify each employer of transactions affecting its account and its right to review pursuant to W.S. 27-3-506.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission may by regulation require an employer electing payments under this section to post surety bonds or other securities.</p>
                  <p>(e) Noncharging provisions under W.S. 27-3-409(a) and 27-3-504(e) and the right to protest benefit charges under W.S. 27-3-506(c) do not apply to employers electing payments under this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any employer failing to make required payments under this section, including assessments of interest and penalties, within ninety (90) days after receipt of a bill, shall not be eligible for making payments under this section for the following tax year unless full payment is received by the department before the contribution rates for the next tax year are computed under this act, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any employer losing the option to make payments under this section because of late payments or nonpayment under this subsection shall have the option reinstated if after one (1) year, all contributions have been paid on a timely basis and no contributions, payments instead of contributions for paid benefits, penalties or interest remain outstanding;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Failure of the tribe or any tribal unit to make payments required under this section including assessment of interest and penalties, after exhaustion of all collection efforts determined necessary by the department, shall exclude services performed for the tribe from employment for purposes of W.S. 27-3-105(a)(iii);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Upon termination or reinstatement of any tribe or tribal unit under this section, the department shall notify the United States internal revenue service and the United States department of labor;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Notice of payment and reporting delinquency to any Indian tribe or tribal unit under this subsection shall include information that failure to make full payment within the prescribed time:</p>
                  <p>(A) Imposes a tax liability upon the tribe under the federal Unemployment Tax Act;</p>
                  <p>(B) Eliminates eligibility of the tribe for election of payments under this section;</p>
                  <p>(C) May result in exclusion of the tribe as an employer under this act as defined by W.S. 27-3-103(a)(x) and the exclusion of services performed for the tribe from employment covered under this act pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(a) Contributions not paid on the date due shall bear interest of two percent (2%) per month or any fractional portion thereof from the due date until payment plus accrued interest is received by the department. Interest collected pursuant to this subsection shall be paid into the employment security revenue account.</p>
                  <p>(b) If after notice an employer defaults in any contribution or interest payment, the amount due shall be collected by civil action in the name of the department. An employer adjudged liable shall pay the costs of the action. Civil actions brought under this subsection shall be given preference over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review under this act and cases under the Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act.</p>
                  <p>(c) If an employer or employing unit neglects or refuses to submit reports and pay contributions or interest required by this act, discontinues business at any of its places of business or leaves this state without submitting reports and paying contributions or interest and the neglect, refusal, discontinuance or removal jeopardizes the fund or any rights to benefits, the department may make a jeopardy assessment against the employer or employing unit. The department shall immediately notify the employer of the assessment in writing by mail. The assessment is final unless the employer files a written protest of the assessment with the department within fifteen (15) days after mailing. An employer filing a protest may request a hearing before the commission in writing. After the hearing the department shall notify the employer of findings of the commission. If an assessment is made, it is final upon issuance of notice and the department shall collect the assessment of any delinquent contributions or interest.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department may require any employing unit which has been habitually delinquent in making contributions, filing returns or qualifying as required by this act to file a bond or other security with the department which will insure the payment of future contributions required by this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any officer or director having at least twenty percent (20%) ownership interest of a corporate employing unit and any manager of a limited liability company having at least twenty percent (20%) ownership interest of a limited liability company employing unit, who controls or supervises filing contribution reports or making payment contributions under this act and who fails to file the reports or make required payments, and the employing unit fails to pay the amounts due the department, is liable for the contributions or reimbursement including interest, penalties and costs. Liability under this subsection shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Survive dissolution, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership or assignment for the benefit of creditors of or by the corporate or limited liability company employing unit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be initially determined by the department. The department's determination is final unless the officer or director determined to be liable files a written appeal within fifteen (15) days after the date notice of the determination is mailed to his address or the address of the corporate or limited liability company employing unit. The burden of proof rests with the department and the appeal shall be conducted in the manner provided under W.S. 27-3-506 for appeals from employer liability determinations.</p>

                  <p>(a) If contributions or interest under this act are not paid on the date due, the department may file a lien certificate verified under oath with the county clerk of the county in which the employer has his principal place of business and a copy with any other county. The certificate shall state the amount of the contributions and interest due, the name and last known address of the delinquent employer and that the department complied with computation and levy requirements for contributions and interest under this act. The county clerk shall number, file and index the certificate under employment security contributions' liens and under chattel mortgages.</p>
                  <p>(b) The amount of contributions and interest due the department is a lien upon all real and personal property including motor vehicles owned or acquired by the employer. The lien is in effect from the time of filing the certificate and covers all property of the employer in any county in which filed. The department may initiate proceedings for foreclosure in district court within ten (10) years from the date of filing. After the date of filing, no person shall remove property subject to a lien under this section from the state.</p>
                  <p>(c) Before filing the certificate, the delinquent employer shall be given opportunity for hearing before the commission or its duly authorized representative. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. If the delinquent employer or his representative fails to appear at the hearing or fails to establish to the satisfaction of the commission that contributions and interest are erroneous, the department may file the certificate. The certificate may be filed without opportunity for hearing if a delinquent employer is leaving the state with intent to default.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a lien is entered and the contributions are paid or found erroneous, the department shall file notice of satisfaction of the lien certificate with the county clerk of any county in which the lien is filed. The department may release any property from the lien or subordinate the lien if it determines contributions and interest are secured by a lien on other property or the collection of contributions and interest is not in jeopardy. The department shall certify release or subordination under this subsection.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-3-515. Adjustment or refund for erroneous collection; reduction of contributions and interest in certain cases; recovery by department.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An employer may apply to the commission or the commission may on its own motion provide for an adjustment of contributions or interest or for a refund if the adjustment cannot be made. This subsection applies only to payments made within three (3) years before the date of application or determination. Upon determination of an erroneous collection, the department shall grant an adjustment without interest for future contribution payments or if the adjustment cannot be made, refund the amount without interest from the fund.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department may upon its own motion or written application reduce or waive the amount of interest due under W.S. 27-3-510(a) if the collection of the full amount of interest is against equity and good conscience. If an employer is no longer subject to this act pursuant to W.S. 27-3-502, the department may reduce or cancel the amount of contributions or interest due upon a determination based on findings entered into the record that the employer is:</p>
                  <p>(i) Adjudicated insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction with no remaining assets;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Deceased with no estate or the estate is closed and all assets are distributed;</p>

                  <p>(v) Not capable of paying the total amount due within three (3) years after the date of termination of coverage under this act, has no property in the state and failure to accept a partial amount of the total as settlement may result in a substantial loss to the fund.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not prevent the department from collecting the balance of interest and contributions not paid if its action was based upon a misrepresentation or omission of facts or if amounts due under this act are collectible at a future date.</p>

                  <p>(b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the department determines that the project is within the criteria stated by this section, it may assess and collect from the general or prime contractor or, in those situations where there is no general or prime contractor, the owner for whom the project is being constructed, on behalf of each employing unit, an additional amount of one-half percent (.5%) times the successful bid amount on the project awarded to each employing unit but not to exceed one-half percent (.5%) times the total amount allowed under all bids accepted under the project. The amount is in addition to any other contribution required by this act and shall be treated as incremental bond payments to insure payment for all benefits ultimately claimed.

                  <p>(d) The amount collected under this section shall be credited to a separate account. Within one (1) year after completion or discontinuance of the project or after an employing unit completes its phase of the work, the department shall determine the total benefits paid to employees of the employing unit or units and if total contributions made by the units under W.S. 27-3-503 exceed total benefits paid to the employees of the units, the difference plus accrued interest shall be refunded to the appropriate general or prime contractor or the owner who paid the additional contribution under subsection (b) of this section but not exceeding the amount paid under this section plus accrued interest. The amount not refunded shall be credited to the unemployment compensation fund.</p>

No arrangement under this subsection shall be entered into unless the participating state or federal agency agrees to reimburse the fund for the amount of benefits paid under this act for wages or services the department finds fair and reasonable. The department shall reimburse to other state or federal agencies a reasonable portion of benefits paid under their law.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department may make and receive reimbursements from or to the fund in accordance with arrangements pursuant to this section. For purposes of this act, reimbursements payable are benefits.</p>
                  <p>(d) To the extent authorized by federal law and constitution and agreements entered into between the federal government and foreign governments, the department may enter into or cooperate in agreements for facilities and services provided by a foreign government for use in receiving claims and paying benefits under this act or similar law of the foreign government.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever an employee quits service or is discharged, the employee shall be paid whatever wages are due him in lawful money of the United States of America, or by check or draft which can be cashed at a bank, no later than the employer's usual practice on regularly scheduled payroll dates or at a time specified under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the employee. The employer may offset from any monies due the employee as wages, any sums due the employer from the employee which have been incurred by the employee during his employment. This section does not apply to the earnings of a sales agent employed on a commission basis and having custody of accounts, money or goods of his principal where the net amount due the agent may not be determinable except after an audit or verification of sales, accounts, funds or stocks.</p>
                  <p>(b) Whenever an employee who has quit, has been discharged from service, or because of action taken by the employer is prevented from working has cause to bring suit for wages earned and due, and shall establish in court the amount which is justly due, the court shall allow to the plaintiff interest on the past due wages at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum from the date of discharge or termination or from the date when unpaid wages are required to be paid as specified in this act, together with a reasonable attorney fee and all costs of suit. Prosecution of a civil action to recover unpaid wages does not preclude prosecution under W.S. 27-4-105.</p>

The director shall have power to join various claims against the same employer in one (1) claim. If either the employer or employee is aggrieved by the director's determination, the aggrieved party may request a fair hearing. The aggrieved party must file a written request for hearing within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the director's determination. Upon receipt of a timely submitted request for hearing, the director shall appoint an independent hearing officer to conduct the fair hearing between the employer and employee. The fair hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The hearing officer's determination shall constitute the director's final agency action. Upon a finding by the hearing officer that the claim is valid, the director shall order the employer to pay the amount of wages due plus an additional equal amount as liquidated damages. Where the employer failed to appeal an adverse determination to the district court and failed to comply with the director's order, the director shall refer the matter to the appropriate county attorney for enforcement of the director's order.</p>

                  <p>(a) Before any public body awards a contract for public works, it shall obtain from the department the prevailing hourly rate of wages in the locality in which the work is to be performed, for each craft or type of workman needed to execute the contract or project. The public body shall specify in the resolution or ordinance and in the call for bids for the contract, what the prevailing hourly rate of wages in the locality is for each craft or type of workman needed to execute the contract, and it shall be mandatory upon the contractor to whom the contract is awarded and upon any subcontractor under him, to pay not less than the specified rates to all workmen employed by them in the execution of the contract. The public body awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to the effect that not less than the prevailing hourly rate of wages as determined by the department pursuant to W.S. 27-4-406, or determined by the court on review, shall be paid to all workmen performing work under the contract. It shall also require in all the contractor's bonds that the contractor include such provision as will guarantee the faithful performance of the prevailing hourly wage clause as provided by the contract. The finding of the department specifying the prevailing hourly rate of wages in accordance with this subsection, shall be final for all purposes of the contract then being considered, unless reviewed under the provisions of this act. A public body doing public works directly shall comply with the prevailing hourly rate of wages portion of this subsection for each craft or type of workman so employed. In reviewing bids for public works contracts, the public body shall only award a bid preference in the percentage specified in W.S. 16-6-102(a) to any prospective contractor who participated, as certified by the department, in the department's wage survey for the period applicable to the contract being awarded.</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining prevailing hourly wage rates, the department shall ascertain and consider the applicable hourly wage rates established by collective bargaining agreements, if any, such hourly wage rates as are paid generally within the locality and the most current department hourly wage survey as adjusted in W.S. 27-4-406.</p>

                  <p>(a) The department shall annually determine the prevailing hourly rate of wages within the state for all occupations, crafts or type of workers expected to be required for public works in the state. In carrying out this subsection, the department shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2007, Ch. 109, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide for a moving average wage adjustment as defined in rules and regulations of the department;</p>

                  <p>(b) Upon determining the prevailing hourly rate of wages under subsection (a) of this section, the department shall provide notice of its determination to:</p>

The written objection shall be a public record and available for inspection by any person who may be affected.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within ten (10) days of the receipt of the objection, the director shall set a date for a hearing on the objection. The date for the hearing shall be within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the objection. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to the objectors at least five (5) days prior to the date set for the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(c) The director may hear each written objection separately or consolidate for hearing any two (2) or more written objections. At the hearing the department shall introduce in evidence the methodology it used and any other facts which were considered at the time of the original determination which formed the basis for its determination. The department or any objectors thereafter may introduce evidence which is material to the issues. In no case shall the department be required to disclose any payroll data or survey data which was used in making a determination under W.S. 27-4-406 which can be used to identify any individual employer.</p>
                  <p>(d) Within ten (10) days of the conclusion of the hearing, the director shall rule on the written objections and make a final determination as the evidence warrants. Immediately upon a final determination, the director shall serve a certified copy upon on all parties to the proceedings by personal service or by registered mail.</p>
                  <p>(e) The final decision of the director of the prevailing wages in the locality shall be subject to review in accordance with the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. All proceedings in any district court affecting a determination of the director shall have priority in hearing and determination over all other civil proceedings pending in the court, except election contests.</p>

                <p>(a) It is a discriminatory or unfair employment practice:</p>
                <p>(i) For an employer to refuse to hire, to discharge, to promote or demote, or to discriminate in matters of compensation or the terms, conditions or privileges of employment against, a qualified disabled person or any person otherwise qualified, because of age, sex, race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry or pregnancy;</p>
                <p>(ii) For a person, an employment agency, a labor organization, or its employees or members, to discriminate in matters of employment or membership against any person, otherwise qualified, because of age, sex, race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry or pregnancy, or a qualified disabled person;</p>
                <p>(iii) For an employer to reduce the wage of any employee to comply with this chapter;</p>
                <p>(iv) For an employer to require as a condition of employment that any employee or prospective employee use or refrain from using tobacco products outside the course of his employment, or otherwise to discriminate against any person in matters of compensation or the terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis of use or nonuse of tobacco products outside the course of his employment unless it is a bona fide occupational qualification that a person not use tobacco products outside the workplace. Nothing within this paragraph shall prohibit an employer from offering, imposing or having in effect a health, disability or life insurance policy distinguishing between employees for type or price of coverage based upon the use or nonuse of tobacco products if:</p>
                <p>(A) Differential rates assessed employees reflect an actual differential cost to the employer; and</p>
                <p>(B) Employers provide written notice to employees setting forth the differential rates imposed by insurance carriers.</p>
                <p>(b) The prohibitions against discrimination based on age in this section apply only to persons at least forty (40) years of age.</p>
                <p>(c) It is not a discriminatory practice for an employer, employment agency or labor organization to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter, except that no employee benefit plan shall excuse the failure to hire any individual, and no seniority system or employee benefit plan shall require or permit involuntary retirement of any individual protected under this chapter because of age. Involuntary retirement is not prohibited if permitted under Title 29, United States Code § 631(c).</p>
                <p>(d) As used in this section "qualified disabled person" means a disabled person who is capable of performing a particular job, or who would be capable of performing a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his disability.</p>

                  <p>(a) This act may be cited as the "Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act".</p>
                  <p>(b) It is the intent of the legislature in creating the Wyoming worker's compensation division that the laws administered by it to provide a worker's benefit system be interpreted to assure the quick and efficient delivery of indemnity and medical benefits to injured and disabled workers at a reasonable cost to the employers who are subject to the Worker's Compensation Act. It is the specific intent of the legislature that benefit claims cases be decided on their merits and that the common law rule of "liberal construction" based on the supposed "remedial" basis of workers' benefits legislation shall not apply in these cases. The worker's benefit system in Wyoming is based on a mutual renunciation of common law rights and defenses by employers and employees alike. Accordingly, the legislature declares that the Worker's Compensation Act is not remedial in any sense and is not to be given a broad liberal construction in favor of any party.</p>

                  <p>(a) The rights and remedies provided in this act for an employee including any joint employee, and his dependents for injuries incurred in extrahazardous employments are in lieu of all other rights and remedies against any employer and any joint employer making contributions required by this act, or their employees acting within the scope of their employment unless the employees intentionally act to cause physical harm or injury to the injured employee, but do not supersede any rights and remedies available to an employee and his dependents against any other person.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-14-105. Action against third party; notice; subrogation; legal representation; payment under reservation of rights; actions by department.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If an employee covered by this act receives an injury under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages, the employee if engaged in work for his employer at the time of the injury is not deprived of any compensation to which he is entitled under this act. He may also pursue his remedy at law against the third party or the coemployee to the extent permitted by W.S. 27-14-104(a). Except as provided by subsections (b), (e) and (f) of this section, if the employee recovers from the third party or the coemployee in any manner including judgment, compromise, settlement or release, the state is entitled to be reimbursed for all payments made, or to be made, to or on behalf of the employee under this act but not to exceed one-third (1/3) of the total proceeds of the recovery without regard to the types of damages alleged in the third-party action. Any recovery by the state shall be reduced pro rata for attorney fees and costs in the same proportion as the employee is liable for fees and costs. All money received by the state under this section shall be credited to the worker's compensation account and considered in computing the employer's experience rating.</p>
                  <p>(b) The director and the attorney general shall be served by certified mail return receipt requested with a copy of the complaint filed in any suit initiated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Service of the complaint on the director and attorney general is a jurisdictional requirement in order to maintain the suit. The director and the attorney general shall be notified in writing by certified mail return receipt requested of any judgment, compromise, settlement or release entered into by an employee. Before offering settlement to an employee, a third party or its insurer shall notify the state of the proposed settlement and give the state fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice in which to object. If notice of proposed settlement is not provided, the state is entitled to initiate an independent action against the third party or its insurer for all payments made to and any amount reserved for or on behalf of the employee under this act. If there is a settlement, compromise or release entered into by the parties in claims against a person other than the employer, the attorney general representing the director shall be made a party in all such negotiations for settlement, compromise or release. The attorney general and the director, for purposes of facilitating compromise and settlement, may in a proper case authorize acceptance by the state of less than the state's claim for reimbursement. The proceeds of any judgment, settlement, compromise or release are encumbered by a continuing lien in favor of the state to the extent of the total amount of the state's claim for reimbursement under this section and for all current and future benefits under this act. The lien shall remain in effect until the state is paid the amount authorized under this section. In addition the person paying the settlement remains liable to the state for the state's claim unless the state through the attorney general signs the release prior to payment of an agreed settlement.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the injury causes the death of the employee, the rights and remedies in this section inure to and the obligations are binding upon the personal representative of the deceased employee for the benefit of his dependents.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any attorney who fails to notify the director and attorney general of any settlement or fails to ensure the state receives its share of the proceeds of any settlement or judgment under subsection (a) of this section shall be reported to the grievance committee of the Wyoming state bar.</p>
                  <p>(e) At any time before the statute of limitation bars an employee or his estate from commencing a claim for personal injury or wrongful death, and upon the unsolicited written request of the employee or estate, the department may commence such an action on behalf of the employee or his estate. From any amounts recovered under this subsection, the state is entitled to an amount equal to all sums awarded as benefits to the employee or his estate and all anticipated future medical costs. Any excess recovery shall be paid to the injured employee or his estate.</p>
                  <p>(f) The department or employer shall have an additional six (6) month limitation period beyond the date on which the employee or his estate is barred under the statute of limitations from commencing a claim for personal injury or wrongful death, in which to commence such an action on behalf of the employee or his estate. From any amounts recovered under this subsection, the state is entitled to an amount equal to all sums awarded as benefits to the employee or his estate, all anticipated future medical costs and all costs of litigation. Any excess recovery shall be paid to the injured employee or his estate.</p>
                  <p>(g) For purposes of subsections (e) and (f) of this section, nothing in this section prohibits any third party from reimbursing the worker's compensation account for medical or temporary total disability costs without prejudice prior to any judgment, settlement or release.</p>

                  <p>(a) The worker's compensation program shall be neither more nor less than self-supporting. Employments affected by this act shall be divided by the division into classes, whose rates may be readjusted annually as the division actuarially determines. Any employer may contest his classification as determined by the division following the contested case provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act except that the division shall carry the burden of proving that the classification is correct. Information shall be kept of the amounts collected and expended in each class for actuarially determining rates, but for payment of compensation, the worker's compensation account shall be one and indivisible.</p>
                  <p>(b) If it is determined at any time and in any manner that a determination by the division of an industrial or employment classification is incorrect, premiums under any corrected classification shall be charged only from the date of change in classification. This subsection shall not apply to any employer's categorization of an employee's gross earnings to an industrial or employment classification.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon compliance with the rate making provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and written approval by the governor, the division shall determine the hazards of the different classes of employments and fix the premiums therefor at the lowest rate consistent with maintenance of an actuarially sound worker's compensation account and the creation of actuarially sound surplus and reserves, and for such purpose shall adopt a system of rating in such a manner as to take account of the peculiar hazard of each risk, mathematically and equally based on actual costs to the program in terms of number and extent of injuries and deaths, and shall use consultants or rating organizations as it determines necessary. The department shall submit an annual report with respect to proposed annual rate adjustments under this section to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee no later than October 1 of the year preceding the implementation of the rate adjustment.</p>
                  <p>The total annual rate adjustment for any employment classification under this section is subject to the following limitations:</p>

                  <p>(v) For the calendar year commencing January 1, 1999 and each calendar year thereafter, any increase in the base rate for each employment classification shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the base rate imposed for that employment classification during the immediately preceding year;</p>
                  <p>(vi) To compensate for the difference between revenues generated under base rate adjustment limitations imposed under paragraph (c)(v) of this section and revenues which would have been generated if base rates had been adjusted without limitations, the division may limit base rate decreases for any employment classification by not more than fifty percent (50%) of the actuarially determined decrease;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Repealed By Laws 1998, ch. 117, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(viii) In determining rates under this section for employers specified under W.S. 27-14-108(a)(ii)(G)(I), the division shall base the rates on one (1) rate classification for sales personnel and one (1) rate classification for all other personnel other than clerical;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Notwithstanding paragraph (v) of this subsection, for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2003, rates shall be adjusted to reflect the reclassification of industry codes in accordance with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) manual, but in no case shall the base premium rate for any classification for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2003 exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the lowest base rate assigned to any employer in that classification under the standard industrial classification manual for the preceding year.</p>
                  <p>(d) In addition, the plan of rating shall use an experience rating system based on three (3) years claim experience, or as much thereof as is available, for employers enrolled under it. This system shall reward employers with a better than average claim experience, penalize employers with a worse than average claim experience and may provide for premium volume discount so long as the account remains actuarially sound. Discounts from or penalties added to base employment classification rates because of claim experience shall not exceed sixty-five percent (65%) for rates through calendar year 2016 and shall not exceed eighty-five percent (85%) for rates beginning with calendar year 2017. An employer who is current on premium payments required by this act may apply to the division for a determination of experience modification rating chargeability for an injury to the employer's employee. The division's determination of chargeability shall be reviewable as provided in W.S. 27-14-601(k)(iii) and (iv). If the division, by a preponderance of the evidence, determines that an employee's injury was primarily caused by a third party, the injury shall not be charged to the employer's account. The employer shall bear the burden of proof in any action brought by the employer for a chargeability determination. If an employer's account is determined to be unchargeable under this subsection, the employer's account shall not be further credited upon recovery from a third party by the division. The division shall by rule and regulation establish necessary procedures for a determination of chargeability. Any determination by the division regarding causation of an injury pursuant to this subsection shall be used only for ratemaking purposes and shall not be admissible in any civil litigation regarding the injury.</p>

                  <p>(iv) The division shall provide the opinion required by paragraph (iii) of this subsection to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee, or its successor, by November 1 of each year;</p>
                  <p>(v) For purposes of calculating reserves, future liabilities shall be discounted to present value using a discount factor selected by the division. The discount factor selected by the division and the reason for its selection shall be included in the annual report to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee or its successor;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The collection through premiums of any deficiency in reserves and surpluses that exceeds five percent (5%) of the fund balance shall be averaged over a ten (10) year period;</p>
                  <p>(vii) For purposes of this section:</p>
                  <p>(A) "Fully reserved" means that the workers' compensation account established by W.S. 27-14-701 has, in the opinion of a qualified actuary, funds sufficient on a discounted basis to provide for all unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses as well as an actuarially appropriate provision for adverse contingencies;</p>
                  <p>(B) "Qualified actuary" means a person who is a fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society or who has been approved as qualified for signing casualty loss reserve opinions by the Casualty Practice Council of the American Academy of Actuaries.</p>
                  <p>(f) The division is given full power and authority to annually determine premium rates and classifications according to the standards set forth under subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section provided that no change in the classification or rates prescribed shall be effective until thirty (30) days after the date of the order making the change.</p>
                  <p>(g) Policies or statements of coverage may be issued to each covered employer. The division shall collect all costs in certifying coverage under this act from the person requesting the certification except for one (1) policy or statement of coverage which may be issued to the employer at no charge.</p>

                  <p>(o) The division shall in accordance with its rules and regulations, grant a discount to rates established under this section in an amount not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the base rate for the employment classification of any employer if the employer complies with a safety program approved by the division and a discount in an amount not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the base rate for the employment classification if the employer complies with a drug and alcohol testing program approved by the division and a discount in an amount not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the base rate for the employment classification if the employer complies with a health and safety consultation program developed by the department of workforce services in consultation with the occupational health and safety commission. In no instance shall the sum total of discounts under this subsection exceed thirty percent (30%) of the base rate for the employment classification for the employer. The discount for the health and safety consultation program shall only remain in effect for three (3) years after the employer is certified to be in compliance with the health and safety consultation program recommendations. In determining safety program approval, drug and alcohol program approval, health and safety consultation program approval and the total discount granted under this subsection, the division shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) The probability the program will reduce the number of accidents and the probable savings which may be realized from the reduction;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Relevant experience, if any, depicting actual reduction in accidents and actual savings which is compared to an industry standard;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The adequacy and accuracy of determining participation in the program and the eligibility for a discount by individual employers;</p>

                  <p>(v) Whether the employer adopts and enforces policies establishing a drug-free workplace which may include an employee assistance program to assist employees with alcohol or other drug problems. The division shall follow rules adopted by the department of workforce services in consultation with the department of health for the effective implementation of this paragraph. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall not impose on any employer the requirement to pay the costs of treatment or any other intervention. Employers enrolled in a safety discount program under this paragraph shall have one (1) year from the effective date of those rules within which to come into compliance.</p>
                  <p>(p) Repealed By Laws 1998, ch. 117, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(q) The division may, in accordance with its rules and regulations, grant a premium credit to rates established under this section if it is determined by a qualified actuary retained by the division that the fund will remain fully reserved after the premium credit is granted and implemented. If the division determines to grant a premium credit, the percentage of credit allowed for the rate year shall be the same for all employers qualified pursuant to paragraph (iii) of this subsection. The following provisions shall also apply to the premium credit program:</p>
                  <p>(i) The premium credit can only be used to offset premiums, and in no case can the premium be redeemed by an employer for cash;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any premium credits shall expire as provided by law. If no law provides for the expiration of credits, credits shall expire as determined by the division;</p>

                  <p>(i) An affected employer submits a written application to the division in the format prescribed by the division after October 1 and before December 31 of the year preceding the year in which the adjustment will be made;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The affected employer's experience modification rating is lower than the average for the employer's industrial classification;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The director determines that the employer has been adversely affected due to the distribution of premiums within the industrial classification; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The employer is contributing less than twenty- five percent (25%) of the total premium of the industrial classification.</p>
                  <p>(s) Any loss of premium due to an adjustment pursuant to subsection (r) of this section shall be distributed among all rate classes in the annual base rate adjustment in the year subsequent to the year in which the adjustment was made.</p>
                  <p>(t) The division may, in accordance with its rules and regulations, create and implement a premium deductible program. The following provisions shall apply to the premium deductible program:</p>

                  <p>(iii) Participating employers shall be financially stable and in good standing with the division;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Participating employers shall report all work injuries within the timeframes specified in W.S. 27-14-506;</p>
                  <p>(v) Participating employers failing to meet the requirements of the premium deductible program shall have their premium base rate reinstated at the full industry base rate, retroactive to the reporting period in which the employer first became noncompliant. Employers whose premium base rate is reinstated at the full industry base rate under this paragraph shall not be re-eligible for the premium deductible program for a minimum of eight (8) calendar quarters;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Participation in the premium deductible program cannot be transferred to a successor employer nor can it be incorporated as part of a merger among employing units.</p>
                  <p>(u) No injury related to COVID-19 for which coverage is provided under this act and for which a claim was filed on or before December 30, 2020 shall be chargeable to an employer's experience rating under this section. The division shall estimate the cost to the fund of an injury subject to this subsection and shall deposit into the fund or dedicate within the fund the amount of the estimated cost but only to the extent federal monies are available for that purpose from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, P.L. 116-136, or from any other available federal monies related to the COVID-19 emergency response.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided under subsection (e) of this section, each employer shall forward to the division on forms provided by the division, a true copy of the payroll of his employees engaged in extrahazardous employment during the current calendar month or quarterly reporting period, certified and affirmed by himself or a person having knowledge of the payrolls under penalty of perjury. Payroll reports and monthly payments under this act shall be submitted on or before the last day of the month following the month in which the earnings are paid, unless otherwise provided by rule and regulation of the division.</p>
                  <p>(b) The director may permit an employer to file payroll reports for quarterly payroll periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 if the diligence of prior reporting payment of premium and other factors warrant. The privilege of quarterly reporting may be revoked by the division if an employer is delinquent in reporting or making payments in accordance with this act. Upon notice of revocation, the employer shall file payroll reports on a monthly basis. Quarterly payroll reports shall be filed and payments made on or before the last day of the month following the quarterly periods.</p>
                  <p>(c) An employer shall notify the director at the time he ceases to employ individuals in covered employment.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any employer or joint employer contributing as required by this act and employing employees or joint employees covered under this act that would qualify as separate classifications, may elect to report gross earnings of the covered entities under one (1) consolidated Wyoming worker's compensation account. A payroll report submitted pursuant to this subsection shall classify the employer's payroll under separate industrial classifications specified under W.S. 27-14-108. Any employer electing to report under a consolidated account shall provide written notice to the division of its intent. The election shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until withdrawn in writing, whichever occurs later. Any employer or joint employer contributing as required by this act and employing employees or joint employees covered by this act who elects to report the payrolls under one (1) consolidated account pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as a single employer for all purposes of this act with the exception of determining the experience rating pursuant to W.S. 27-14-201(d) and the premium tax credit pursuant to W.S. 27-14-201(q).</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an employer may elect to submit payroll reports and make premium payments in advance pursuant to rule and regulation of the division. In its rules and regulations established under this subsection, the division shall provide for adjustment of premium payments for any fiscal year in accordance with overpayments or underpayments made during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section and commencing January 1, 1994, governmental entity employers shall make payments for rates established by the division under W.S. 27-14-201 for any calendar year commencing on July 1 of that calendar year and ending June 30 of the immediately succeeding calendar year. For purposes of this subsection "governmental entity employer" includes state, county, municipal, school district, community college, university and special district employers.</p>
                  <p>(g) The department of workforce services shall by rule and regulation establish a joint payroll reporting system for the purposes of the Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act and Wyoming Employment Security Law. Nothing in this subsection shall require the department to provide a joint payroll reporting system to all qualifying employers.</p>
                  <p>(h) An employer's categorization in its payroll reports of an employee's gross earnings to the appropriate industrial or employment classification shall be in accordance with division rules and regulations. If the division finds any employee gross earnings to be incorrectly categorized to an industrial or employment classification, the division shall within a one (1) year period beginning with the current rate year and including the previous rate year, credit or debit the employer's account for the overpayment or underpayment as appropriate. The division shall waive any underpayment amount, interest, penalties or claim reimbursements if the incorrect employee gross earnings categorization was caused by reliance on a written determination of the division and the employer provided full and truthful disclosure of all pertinent information in requesting a determination or if the employer makes a good faith error in categorization. The division may waive any interest, penalties or claim reimbursement caused by an underpayment due to an otherwise incorrect employee gross earning categorization of an employee's earnings in any other case if it determines there are sufficient extraordinary circumstances which warrant a waiver. If an employer's account has been debited pursuant to this subsection, the employer shall not be considered contributing as required by this act if he does not pay the underpayment within thirty (30) days of his account being debited or within thirty (30) days of completion of any appeals of the determination of an underpayment, whichever occurs later.</p>
                  <p>(j) The division, on or about the fifteenth of the month following the due date, shall send a written notice of delinquency to an employer failing to submit a report as required by this section. An employer failing to submit a report required by this section within thirty (30) days of the date due shall, in addition to any delinquent premium penalty pursuant to W.S. 27-14-203, be assessed a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each delinquent report.</p>

If the employer fails, neglects or refuses to satisfy his liability within the thirty (30) day period, the amount may be recovered by civil action in the name of the director. The entry of final order by the division or hearing examiner approving and allowing an award of compensation is prima facie proof of the liability of an employer failing to comply with this act.</p>

The amount due is a lien upon all real and personal property of the employer and is in effect from the time of filing and covers all property of the employer in any county in which filed. The director shall file notice of satisfaction of the lien with the county clerk if payments are collected or found erroneous and may release any property from the lien or subordinate the lien if he determines payments are secured by a lien on other property or the collection of payments are not in jeopardy.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any employer employing any person in any covered employment who, following notice by the division of the remedies authorized under this section, fails to apply for coverage under this act or, after obtaining coverage under this act, fails to make payments within thirty (30) days of the date due, may be enjoined in an action instituted by the director from engaging or continuing in a business covered by this act. Operations may, in whole or in part, be enjoined until required payments are made and the employer complies with this act. The director is not required to give bond in the action.</p>
                  <p>(g) Remedies provided by this act are cumulative and are not exclusive.</p>
                  <p>(h) If judgment is rendered in favor of the employer in any action under this section, he shall be entitled to recover all his costs including a reasonable attorney's fee from the division. This recovery shall not affect the employer's experience rating.</p>
                  <p>(j) The division may enter into an installment payment agreement with a delinquent employer where payment in a lump sum would cause severe inconvenience to the employer, provided that:</p>

                  <p>(ii) The term of the installment payment agreement shall not exceed twelve (12) months; and</p>

                  <p>(k) No additional interest, penalties or other liabilities authorized under this section shall accrue to the employer for the employer's delinquencies if the employer has entered into an installment payment agreement pursuant to subsection (j) of this section and is in compliance with the terms of the agreement. The employer's relief from liability provided pursuant to W.S. 27-14-104(a) shall remain in effect while the employer is in compliance with the agreement, provided that the employer has no further delinquencies under this section.

                  <p>(a) State agencies shall administer this act as an employer with respect to its employees including filing payroll reports and submitting premium payments for those employees engaged in extrahazardous employment and covered under this act. Each state agency having officers or employees subject to this act shall file payroll reports and submit premium payments as required by this act. Premium payments for coverage of any employee employed under a federally funded program administered by an agency may be made from available federal funds.</p>
                  <p>(b) For the purpose of determining employer contributions under this act, all school-to-work participants for which coverage has been elected under W.S. 27-14-108(m), all persons receiving training under any work or job training program for which coverage has been elected under W.S. 27-14-108(p), all volunteers covered under this act, mine rescue team members, recipients of any welfare program performing work for a governmental entity, federal programs which require coverage for their participants, prisoners and probationers under W.S. 27-14-108(d)(ix) and persons performing community service pursuant to a criminal sentencing order, or a diversion agreement entered into with a prosecuting authority, under W.S. 27-14-108(d)(xv), are deemed to be paid for each month of active service, an amount established by rule and regulation of the division based upon the cost of the specific employment category to the worker's compensation account. This amount shall be established solely as a basis for determining employer contributions and is not binding upon any employer as an actual required salary for any volunteer or other individual enumerated under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of determining employer contributions under this act for officers of a corporation or members of a limited liability company electing coverage under W.S. 27-14-108(k), rates shall be applied for each officer or member covered under this act against the statewide average wage for the preceding twelve (12) month period as determined under W.S. 27-14-802(b).</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, a school district or community college district may make payroll reports and payments on behalf of any employer electing coverage for school-to-work participants under W.S. 27-14-108(m). If a school or community college district elects to make payments under this subsection, the district shall continue to make reports and payments for the duration of participation by the school-to-work participant with that employer.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-14-206. Public contract work; coverage procedure; responsibility on private contracts.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If the state, county, University of Wyoming, community college district, school district, special district or municipality engages in work in which employees are employed for wages and if the work is being done by contract, the payroll of the prime or general contractor or subcontractor shall be the basis of computation for the payroll assessment. The required payments shall be subject to the provisions of this act and the state, the county, university, community college district, school district, special district or municipality, shall be entitled to collect from the prime or general contractor the full amount payable under this act unless the subcontractor primarily liable for the payment of premiums has paid the premiums as provided for in this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The prime or general contractor shall secure certification when a contract is awarded or before permitting a subcontractor to begin work, that the subcontractor has in good standing an account under this act that covers all coverable employees in the employ of the subcontractor.</p>
                  <p>(c) The state, county, university, community college district, school district, special district or municipality shall secure certification before allowing a prime or general contractor to permit coverable employees to start work on a contract, that the contractor, prime or general, has in good standing an account under this act that covers employees who are subject to this act.</p>
                  <p>(d) Before final settlement is made by the state, county, university, community college district, school district, special district or municipality, the contractor shall furnish evidence that all obligations for covered employees on the contract have been paid as provided by this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) In private work a contractor who subcontracts all or any part of a contract is liable for the payment of worker's compensation premiums for the employees of the subcontractor unless the subcontractor primarily liable for the payment of premiums has paid the premiums as provided for in this act. Any contractor or his carrier who becomes liable for the premiums may recover the amount of the premiums paid and necessary expenses from the subcontractor primarily liable therefor. For premiums paid on behalf of the employees of any subcontractor pursuant to this subsection, the contractor shall be afforded all privileges and immunities under this act as if he were the employer of the subcontractor's employees.</p>
                  <p>(f) The owner or lessee of land shall be deemed a contractor when he contracts with another who shall be deemed a subcontractor to have work performed of a kind which is a regular or recurrent part of the work of the trade, business, occupation or profession of the owner or lessee. This subsection shall not apply to the owner or lessee of land principally used for agriculture.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-14-207. Employer registration required; person acquiring trade of another employer; transfer of experience and assignment of rates; out of state employers.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any employer subject to this act shall not commence business or engage in work in this state without applying for coverage under this act and receiving a statement of coverage from the division.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a person acquiring the trade, organization, business or substantially all of the assets of an employer subject to this act shall assume the previous employer's account, experience rating and premium rate as assigned by the division, provided the previous employer is not participating in the premium deductible program under W.S. 27-14-201(t). If the previous employer is participating in the premium deductible program, the acquiring person shall assume the previous employer's account, experience rating and premium rate as determined without premium deductible program eligibility. The acquiring person shall assume the premium rate which is in effect at the time of the acquisition based on the existing account's classification, experience rating and any surcharge which may apply, as determined without premium deductible program eligibility.</p>
                  <p>(c) A person acquiring the trade, organization, business or substantially all of the assets of any employer subject to this act whose owners or shareholders have not held an ownership interest in the employer being acquired within one (1) year previous to the date of acquisition shall assume the previous employer's account number, experience rating and premium rate as assigned by the division, provided the previous employer is not participating in the premium deductible program under W.S. 27-14-201(t). If the previous employer is participating in the premium deductible program, the acquiring person shall assume the previous employer's account, experience rating and premium rate as determined without premium deductible program eligibility.</p>
                  <p>(d) The transfer of some or all of an employer's workforce to another person shall be considered a transfer of trade or business when, as a result of the transfer, the transferring employer no longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred workforce, and the trade or business is performed by the person to whom the workforce is transferred.</p>
                  <p>(e) If an employer transfers all or a portion of its trade or business to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management or control of the two (2) employers, then the workers' compensation experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom the business is transferred. The rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective the first day of the calendar quarter immediately following the date of the transfer of trade or business.</p>
                  <p>(f) If, following a transfer of experience under this section, the department determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of the trade or business was to obtain a reduced premium liability, then the accounts of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account.</p>
                  <p>(g) If a person is not an employer under this section at the time the person acquires the trade or business of an employer, the workers' compensation experience of the acquired employer shall not be transferred to the person if the department finds that the person acquired the trade or business of the employer solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower premium rate. Instead, the person shall be assigned the applicable industry base rate in effect at the time of the acquisition. In determining whether the trade or business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower premium rate, the department shall use objective factors which may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long the business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.</p>
                  <p>(h) Where an employer has not had prior operations in Wyoming and has not had prior worker's compensation insurance coverage in Wyoming, and moves or expands operations from another state into Wyoming, and begins operations that are the same or similar to operations outside of Wyoming, the division shall assign the employer experience modification rate as calculated per the current experience modification rating formula in place at the time. The division shall assign such experience modification to the partial year ending June 30 after the start of coverage in Wyoming and to the first full policy year subsequent to the start of coverage in Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(j) The division by rule and regulation shall establish procedures to identify the transfer or acquisition of a business, or the movement of an out of state operation to Wyoming, for purposes of this section and W.S. 27-14-806. The division may require by regulation an out of state employer to submit any information necessary for the purpose of determining an experience modification rate under subsection (h) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) The expense of medical and hospital care of an injured employee shall be paid from the date of the compensable injury unless under general arrangement the employee is entitled to free medical and hospital care or the employer furnishes adequate and proper medical and hospital care to his employees.</p>
                  <p>(b) No fee for medical or hospital care under this section shall be allowed by the division without first reviewing the fee for appropriateness and reasonableness in accordance with its adopted fee schedules.</p>
                  <p>(c) Hospital care includes private nursing or nursing home care if approved by the director.</p>
                  <p>(d) Medical and hospital care shall be obtained if possible within Wyoming, or in an adjoining state if the hospital or health care provider in the adjoining state is closer to the scene of the accident or to the usual place of employment of the employee than a hospital or health care provider in Wyoming, unless otherwise authorized by the division. Except as otherwise authorized by the division, reimbursements for travel in obtaining medical and hospital care shall not be paid:</p>
                  <p>(i) For travel of less than ten (10) miles one (1) way except by ambulance travel as set forth in W.S. 27-14-401(e);</p>
                  <p>(ii) For travel other than that necessary to obtain the closest available medical or hospital care needed by the employee except in those instances where travel within Wyoming is at a greater distance than travel outside of Wyoming;</p>

                  <p>(e) If transportation by ambulance is necessary, the division shall allow a reasonable charge for the ambulance service at a rate not in excess of the rate schedule established by the director under the procedure set forth for payment of medical and hospital care, provided this subsection shall not apply to air ambulance transport services.</p>
                  <p>(f) Subject to subsection (h) of this section, an employer or the division may designate health care providers to provide nonemergency medical attention to his employees or to claimants under this act. Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the employee may for any reason, select any other health care provider. If the employee selects a health care provider other than the one (1) selected by the employer or the division, the employer or division may require a second opinion from a health care provider of their choice. The second opinion may include an independent medical evaluation, a functional capacity exam or a review of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and fees of the employee's health care provider. The independent medical evaluation, a functional capacity exam or the review by the employer's health care provider shall be paid for by the employer and the evaluation, a functional capacity exam or review by the division's health care provider shall be paid from the worker's compensation account.</p>
                  <p>(g) The division may engage in and contract for medical bill review programs, medical case management programs and utilization review programs. The division may also negotiate with out-of-state health care providers regarding the payment of fees for necessary medical care to injured workers, not to exceed the usual, customary charges for the comparable treatment in the community where rendered or the amount payable for the same services by the worker's compensation fund or account of the state where rendered, whichever is less.</p>
                  <p>(h) In the case of an inmate employed in a correctional industries program authorized by W.S. 25-13-101 through 25-13-107 or performing services pursuant to W.S. 7-16-202, the department of corrections shall select the health care provider for the inmate.</p>
                  <p>(j) Emergency and medically necessary air ambulance transport services for an employee shall be covered under W.S. 42-4-123, subject to availability and any limitations specified by the department under W.S. 42-4-123(a). The department of workforce services shall pay reimbursement for services under this section to the department of health as specified under W.S. 42-4-123. Application of this subsection shall be contingent on operation of the air ambulance transport services program under W.S. 42-4-123(b).</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to payment of medical and hospital care and artificial replacement, an injured employee and his dependents may be entitled to one (1) or more awards for:</p>
                  <p>(i) Temporary total disability or temporary light duty;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Permanent partial impairment;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Permanent partial disability or vocational rehabilitation as provided under W.S. 27-14-408;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Permanent total disability; or</p>
                  <p>(v) Death.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding the date of death or the date of the determination of permanent total disability, in the case of permanent total disability or death, each child of an employee shall be paid two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month for payments made after July 1, 2009, until the child dies or reaches the age of twenty-one (21) years, whichever first occurs, or if the child is physically or mentally incapacitated until the child dies unless qualified for and receiving benefits under the Medicaid home and community based waiver program. If the child is enrolled or preregistered in a post secondary educational institution including a four-year college, community college or private trade school licensed pursuant to W.S. 21-2-401 through 21-2-407 and providing career, technical or apprenticeship training, the child shall receive the amount provided by this section until the child attains the age of twenty-five (25) years. The amount awarded under this subsection shall be adjusted for inflation annually by the division, using the consumer price index or its successor index of the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, or three percent (3%), whichever is less.</p>
                  <p>(c) All awards stated in this section except awards under paragraph (a)(i), subsection (b) and paragraphs (e)(ii), (iv) and (v) and (h)(ii) and subsection (k) of this section shall be paid monthly at the rates prescribed by this subsection. For permanent partial impairment under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, the award shall be calculated at the rate of two-thirds (2/3) of the statewide average monthly wage for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the quarterly period in which the benefits are first paid as determined pursuant to W.S. 27-14-802. For temporary total disability under paragraph</p>
                  <p>(a)(i) of this section, the award shall be paid monthly at the rate of thirty percent (30%) of the statewide average monthly wage or two-thirds (2/3) of the injured employee's actual monthly earnings at the time of injury, whichever is greater, but shall not exceed the lesser of one hundred percent (100%) of the injured employee's actual monthly earnings at the time of the injury or the statewide average monthly wage for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the quarterly period in which the injury occurred as determined pursuant to W.S. 27-14-802 with one-half (1/2) of the monthly award paid on or about the fifteenth of the month and one-half (1/2) paid on or about the thirtieth of the month. For temporary light duty under paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the award shall be paid monthly at the rate of eighty percent (80%) of the difference between the employee's light duty wage and the employee's actual monthly earnings at the time of injury. For permanent partial and permanent total disability or death under paragraphs (a)(iii), (iv) and (v) of this section, the award shall be paid monthly computed as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) For those employees whose actual monthly earnings are less than seventy-three percent (73%) of the statewide average monthly wage, the award shall be ninety-two percent (92%) of the injured employee's actual monthly earnings;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For those employees whose actual monthly earnings are equal to or greater than seventy-three percent (73%) of the statewide average monthly wage, but less than the statewide average monthly wage, the award shall be two-thirds (2/3) of the statewide average monthly wage;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For those employees whose actual monthly earnings are greater than or equal to the statewide average monthly wage, the award shall be two-thirds (2/3) of the employee's actual monthly earnings, but the award shall be capped at and shall not exceed the statewide average monthly wage;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the case of death due to work related causes, and if the award computed under paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of this subsection is less than eighty percent (80%) of the statewide average monthly wage, the award shall be adjusted to an amount not less than eighty percent (80%) of the statewide average monthly wage or seventy-five percent (75%) of the injured employee's actual monthly earnings at the time of injury, whichever is greater. In no event shall the award exceed two (2) times the statewide average monthly wage for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the quarterly period in which the injury occurred as determined pursuant to W.S. 27-14-802;</p>
                  <p>(v) Awards for permanent total disability shall be adjusted for inflation annually by the division, using the consumer price index or its successor index of the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, for the calendar year before the date of adjustment or three percent (3%), whichever is less. The adjustment provided by this paragraph shall apply to all awards for permanent total disability benefits in effect on or after July 1, 2009 using as the base for calculation the award in effect on that date or the first award, whichever is later. The adjustment shall become effective annually on July 1 and shall be applied to all awards for permanent total disability that were first made at least one (1) year before the effective date of the adjustment.</p>
                  <p>(d) If an injured employee entitled to receive or receiving an award under paragraph (a)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section dies due to causes other than the work related injury, the balance of the award shall be paid:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the surviving spouse;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If there is no surviving spouse or if the spouse remarries or dies, the balance of the award shall be paid to the surviving dependent children of the employee. Each surviving dependent child shall receive a share of the award in the proportion that the number of months from the death or remarriage until the child attains the age of majority, or if the child is physically or mentally incapacitated until the child attains the age of twenty-one (21) years, bears to the total number of months until all children will attain these ages;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If there is no surviving spouse or if the spouse remarries or dies and there are no dependent children or the children have attained the age of majority or twenty-one (21) if physically or mentally incapacitated, or die, the balance of the award shall be paid to a surviving parent of the employee if the parent received substantially all of his financial support from the employee at the time of injury. If two (2) remaining parents of the employee who received substantially all of their financial support from the employee at the time of the injury survive the employee, the balance of the award shall be divided equally between the two (2) parents;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Payment of the award shall cease:</p>
                  <p>(A) If there is no surviving spouse, dependent children or dependent parents;</p>
                  <p>(B) Upon remarriage or death of a spouse and there are no dependent children or dependent parents;</p>
                  <p>(C) Upon the death of a dependent child as to payments to that child; and</p>
                  <p>(D) Upon the death of a dependent parent as to payments to that parent.</p>
                  <p>(e) If an injured employee dies as a result of the work related injury whether or not an award under paragraphs (a)(i) through (iv) of this section has been made:</p>
                  <p>(i) All awards under paragraphs (a)(i) through (iv) of this section shall cease as of the date of death;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The burial expenses of the deceased employee shall be paid in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) together with an additional amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to cover other related expenses, unless other arrangements exist between the employer and employee under agreement;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The surviving spouse shall receive for one hundred (100) months a monthly payment as provided by subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section. If the surviving spouse dies before the award is entirely paid or if there is no surviving spouse, the unpaid balance of the award shall be paid to the surviving dependent children of the employee in the manner prescribed by paragraph (d)(ii) of this section. If there are no dependent children, further payments under this paragraph shall cease as of the date of the spouse's death;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In addition to any amount paid under paragraph (e)(iii) of this section, surviving children shall receive an award as provided by subsection (b) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the employee died with no surviving spouse or dependent children but with one (1) surviving parent or two (2) surviving parents of the employee who received at least one-half (1/2) of his or their financial support from the employee at the time of injury, the surviving parent or parents shall receive a monthly payment as provided by subsection (c) of this section for sixty (60) months thereafter or until the parent or the survivor of them dies.</p>
                  <p>(f) Awards to an employee or a spouse for permanent partial disability, permanent total disability or death may, upon application to the division with a showing of exceptional necessity and notice to the employer, be paid in whole or in part in a lump sum. In no event shall an award for permanent partial impairment under W.S. 27-14-405 be paid in a lump sum.</p>
                  <p>(g) Following payment in full of any award, or if a lump sum settlement was made under subsection (f) of this section when the award would have been fully paid but for the lump sum settlement, to an employee for permanent total disability or to a surviving spouse for death of an employee, an additional award for extended benefits may be granted subject to the following requirements and limitations:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of an employee:</p>
                  <p>(A) A claim for compensation is filed by the employee or someone on his behalf;</p>
                  <p>(B) The employee establishes a reasonable effort on his behalf has been made to return to part time or full time employment including retraining and educational programs;</p>
                  <p>(C) The division in determining entitlement under this paragraph shall consider the amount of the monthly award made to an injured worker pursuant to W.S. 27-14-403(a)(iv), all earned income of the injured worker, all employment based retirement income of the injured worker, all income derived by the injured worker as a result of the injury, excluding mortgage or any other loan credit insurance, or any supplemental income insurance purchased by or on behalf of the employee and any periodic payments from any other governmental entity to the injured worker. The division shall not consider any other income received by the injured worker or members of the injured worker's household;</p>
                  <p>(D) The maximum monthly amount of additional compensation shall not exceed the amount provided in subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(E) The division may attach reasonable conditions to application for or receipt of awards under this subsection including retraining or educational programs and the award may be adjusted in accordance with fulfillment of the conditions;</p>
                  <p>(F) The division may decrease an award to qualify an employee eligible for maximum benefits under any other state or federal pension plan;</p>
                  <p>(G) Any award granted under this subsection shall not exceed twelve (12) months unless the division determines an award for a period exceeding twelve (12) months but not greater than four (4) years is appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of a surviving spouse, upon application to the division and a showing of necessity, the division may award continued monthly payments to the spouse not to exceed one-third (1/3) of the statewide average monthly wage for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the quarter in which the injury occurred. An award granted under this paragraph shall not exceed twelve (12) months but may be renewed and shall cease at the time the spouse dies or remarries.</p>
                  <p>(h) All awards to a minor or individual with a legal disability shall be paid:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the legal guardian or conservator if one exists; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) As the division determines to be in the best interests of the minor or individual if there is no legal guardian or conservator.</p>
                  <p>(j) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Actual monthly earnings" means the injured employee's actual monthly earnings at the time of injury excluding any payment for casual or unscheduled overtime and any fringe benefit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Overtime" means payments for work in excess of forty (40) hours per week;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Statewide average monthly wage" means the statewide average monthly wage for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the quarterly period in which the injury occurred as determined pursuant to W.S. 27-14-802.</p>
                  <p>(k) Any injured worker who has or is receiving medical services entirely in Wyoming from a Wyoming health care provider shall be eligible if otherwise qualified for temporary total disability payments at the rate of seventy percent (70%) of the injured worker's actual monthly earnings at the time of the injury but not to exceed one hundred and three percent (103%) of the statewide average wage for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the quarterly period in which the injury occurred as determined pursuant to W.S. 27-14-802, with the following exceptions:</p>
                  <p>(i) If an injured worker is injured outside of Wyoming, the injured worker if otherwise qualified shall be eligible to receive temporary total disability payments at the rate provided in this subsection, provided the injured worker receives services entirely in Wyoming from a Wyoming health care provider after initial treatment following the injury;</p>

                  <p>(iii) An injured worker otherwise qualified for temporary total disability payments shall be eligible to receive temporary total disability payments at the rate provided in this subsection if due to unavailability of medical services in Wyoming, the division provides written authorization, before or after treatment, to the injured worker to obtain the medical services from an out-of-state health care provider and the out- of-state health care provider agreed to accept as full payment the fees paid by the division pursuant to the division's fee schedule. For purposes of this subsection, medical services shall be deemed unavailable in Wyoming if the distance from the injured worker's residence to an in-state health care provider is at least one hundred (100) miles greater than the distance from the injured worker's residence to an out-of-state medical provider;</p>
                  <p>(iv) An injured worker otherwise qualified for temporary total disability payments shall be eligible to receive temporary total disability payments at the rate provided in this subsection if the employer has a contractual agreement with an out-of-state health care provider.</p>

                  <p>(a) If after a compensable injury is sustained and as a result of the injury the employee is subject to temporary total disability as defined under W.S. 27-14-102(a)(xviii), the injured employee is entitled to receive a temporary total disability award for the period of temporary total disability as provided by W.S. 27-14-403(c). The period for receiving a temporary total disability award under this section for injuries resulting from any one (1) incident or accident shall not exceed a cumulative period of twenty-four (24) months, except that the division pursuant to its rules and regulations and in its discretion may in the event of extraordinary circumstances award additional temporary total disability benefits. The division's decision to grant such additional benefits shall be reviewable by a hearing examiner only for an abuse of discretion by the division.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any employee awarded benefits under W.S. 27-14-405 or 27-14-406 is not eligible for benefits under subsection (a) of this section unless the employee has returned to gainful employment and following employment, undergoes additional surgery not reasonably contemplated before the award for permanent impairment or disability and then only for a reasonable period of recuperation, confinement for medical care during the actual period of confinement or unless application is made and an award is granted under W.S. 27-14-605.</p>
                  <p>(c) Payment under subsection (a) of this section shall cease prior to expiration of the twenty-four (24) month maximum period specified under subsection (a) of this section if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Recovery is complete to the extent that the earning power of the employee at a gainful occupation for which he is reasonably suited by experience or training is substantially restored; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The employee has an ascertainable loss, qualifies for benefits under W.S. 27-14-405 or 27-14-406 and the first monthly payment pursuant to either of those sections has been issued to the employee.</p>
                  <p>(d) Disability payments under this section shall not be allowed for the first three (3) days of disability unless the incapacity extends beyond eight (8) days. If payments cease for a period of eight (8) days or more, the employee may apply for reinstatement under W.S. 27-14-605 and any award granted shall be treated as an initial award. In determining the period of disability, the day the disability occurred shall be included unless the employee received full payment of wages for that day. No employee shall be forced to use sick leave before applying for or instead of benefits under this section. Benefits under subsection (a) of this section shall not be paid if:</p>
                  <p>(i) An employee or his personal representative fails to file a claim for benefits within thirty (30) days after the first day immediately succeeding the first thirty (30) days of any certified period of temporary total disability;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A claim is filed without the signature of the claimant and certification by the attending health care provider; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) An employee is receiving unemployment compensation under W.S. 27-3-101 through 27-3-704.</p>

                  <p>(f) Any individual serving time in any penal or correctional institution who is an employee under this act or any probationer or parolee not covered by a qualifying employer-employee relationship performing work pursuant to court order is not eligible for benefits under this section for injuries suffered during the period of incarceration, probation or parole. Upon release from the penal or correctional institution or upon completion of probation or parole, any remaining benefits for which the individual would otherwise qualify for under this section shall be paid from and after the date of release or completion. In addition, any individual classified as a school-to-work participant under this act is not eligible for benefits under this section for injuries suffered during the participation in a school-to-work program activity.</p>
                  <p>(g) Only a health care provider may certify temporary total disability under this act. The length of time of the initial certification or recertification of temporary total disability shall be established by the department after considering the recommendation of the health care provider and current medical literature. Subject to W.S. 27-14-609, the employer, employee or division may request recertification of the period of temporary total disability at intervals of not less than sixty (60) days, provided that in the event of extraordinary circumstances, the division may reconsider recertification at any time. The temporary total disability shall not exceed the period allowed by W.S. 27-14-404(a).</p>
                  <p>(h) Payment under subsection (a) of this section shall be suspended if the injured employee fails to appear at an appointment with his health care provider. Payment shall be suspended under this subsection until such time as the employee appears at a subsequent rescheduled appointment. Payment shall not be suspended for failing to appear at an appointment if the employee notifies the case manager or the division prior to the appointment or within twenty-four (24) hours after missing the appointment and the division determines, after recommendation by the case manager, that the employee made all reasonable efforts to appear at the appointment. At the time of the first benefit payment under this section, the division shall notify the employee of the requirements and other provisions of this subsection, including the procedures to be followed in notifying the case manager or the division. For purposes of this subsection, health care provider includes physical and occupational therapists.</p>
                  <p>(j) An employer may make a written offer of temporary light duty work to an employee receiving temporary total disability under subsection (a) of this section. The offer shall be a bona fide offer on a form supplied by the division, stating with specificity the proposed hours of employment, starting date, wage and physical or other functional capacity requirements of the light duty work. If the employee accepts the offer, the temporary total disability award shall cease and the employee shall receive a temporary light duty award, subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) After notice to the employer, the health care provider who certified temporary total disability has certified on the light duty work agreement that the employee is released to perform the light duty work described in the agreement;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All periods of light duty work may not exceed one (1) year cumulatively for any one (1) injury;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The temporary light duty assignment commences not less than fourteen (14) days following the written offer;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Payment of the temporary light duty award shall cease as provided for temporary total disability under subsection (c) of this section or if the employee's actual monthly earnings from all sources when combined with the temporary light duty award exceed ninety-five percent (95%) of the employee's actual monthly earnings at the time of injury;</p>
                  <p>(v) The employer shall provide the division before commencement of the light duty work with a copy of the light duty work agreement signed by the employer and the employee, and shall report to the division by the fifteenth of each month the employee's hours and rate of pay for the previous month;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The temporary total disability award of any employee refusing a bona fide written offer of temporary light duty work pursuant to this subsection shall be reduced by two- thirds (2/3) unless the employee provides written proof to the employer and the division of enrollment by the employee in any collegiate, vocational retraining, general education development or other program approved by the division which is designed to retrain the employee for employment in an occupation other than that previously offered by the employer; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) The temporary light duty award under this subsection and the balance of a temporary total disability award under paragraph (vi) of this subsection shall not be charged to the employer's experience rating established under W.S. 27-14-201(d).</p>
                  <p>(k) If the employer objects to a division determination that an injury is compensable and the employee's health care provider has certified the employee as temporarily totally disabled, an injured worker may request an interim benefit while his case is under appeal. The amount of the benefit will be calculated at the temporary total disability rate as determined under W.S. 27-14-403(c) and shall be paid for up to three (3) months until a final compensability decision by a hearing examiner is issued or until the expiration of the period of certified temporary disability, whichever occurs first. The period during which the interim benefit is received shall be included in the time period allowed under W.S. 27-14-404(a). The experience rating of the employer against whom a claim is made shall not be charged for the interim benefit if the injury is determined after hearing not to be compensable. Only one (1) interim benefit under this subsection may be awarded per injury.</p>

                  <p>(f) An injured employee suffering an ascertainable loss may apply for a permanent partial impairment award as provided in this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) An injured employee's impairment shall be rated by a licensed physician using the most recent edition of the American Medical Association's guide to the evaluation of permanent impairment. The award shall be paid as provided by W.S. 27-14-403 for the number of months determined by multiplying the percentage of impairment by sixty (60) months.</p>
                  <p>(h) An injured employee awarded permanent partial impairment benefits may apply for a permanent disability award subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) The injured employee is because of the injury, unable to return to employment at a wage that is at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the monthly gross earnings the employee was earning at the time of injury;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An application for permanent partial disability is filed not before three (3) months after the date of ascertainable loss or three (3) months before the last scheduled impairment payment, whichever occurs later, but in no event later than one (1) year following the later date; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The employee has actively sought suitable work, considering the employee's health, education, training and experience.</p>
                  <p>(j) The disability award under subsection (h) of this section shall be payable monthly in the amount provided by W.S. 27-14-403 for the number of months determined by adding the number of months computed under this subsection as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Fourteen (14) months, multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is sixty-five (65) minus the employee's age at the date of injury and the denominator is forty-five (45);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Eight and one-half (8 1/2) months, multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is four (4) minus the employee's completed years of education beyond the twelfth grade, not to exceed four (4) years, and the denominator is four (4);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Six (6) months, multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is four (4) minus the number of different occupations in which the employee has worked at least eighteen (18) months in the eight (8) year period preceding the injury but not to exceed four (4), and the denominator is four (4);</p>
                  <p>(iv) Up to two (2) months if the employee at the time of injury was engaged in a formal education or training program for an occupation which was reasonably expected to pay more than the employee's employment at the time of injury and the employee, because of the permanent injury, will be unable to enter into the new occupation;</p>
                  <p>(v) One (1) month if the employee is forty-five (45) to forty-nine (49) years of age at the time of injury, two (2) months if the employee is fifty (50) to fifty-four (54) years of age at the time of injury, and three (3) months if the employee is fifty-five (55) years of age or older at the time of injury.</p>
                  <p>(k) An employee incurring permanent disfigurement due to an injury to the face or head which affects his earning capacity or ability to secure gainful employment shall receive in proportion to the extent of the disfigurement, an additional physical impairment award not to exceed six (6) months of compensation payable monthly as provided by W.S. 27-14-403(c). Any previous disfigurement to the face or head of the employee shall be considered when authorizing the award.</p>
                  <p>(m) If the percentage of physical impairment is disputed, the division shall obtain a second opinion and if the ratings conflict, shall determine the physical impairment award upon consideration of the initial and second opinion. Any objection to a final determination pursuant to this subsection shall be referred to the medical commission for hearing by a medical hearing panel acting as hearing examiner pursuant to W.S. 27-14-616.</p>
                  <p>(n) This section specifies the length of time amounts computed pursuant to W.S. 27-14-403(c) are to be awarded and except for amounts awarded under W.S. 27-14-408, shall not be construed to allow awards in excess of the amounts computed pursuant to W.S. 27-14-403(c).</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to W.S. 27-14-602, upon certification by a physician licensed to practice surgery or medicine that an injury results in permanent total disability as defined under W.S. 27-14-102(a)(xvi), an injured employee shall receive for eighty (80) months a monthly payment as provided by W.S. 27-14-403(c) and dependent children shall receive an award as provided by W.S. 27-14-403(b). The eighty (80) month period shall be reduced by the number of months for which previous awards under W.S. 27-14-405 were made for the injury that resulted in the determination of permanent total disability, with the injured worker receiving the monthly amount calculated pursuant to W.S. 27-14-403(c) for the balance of the eighty (80) month period. The monthly payment amount computed under W.S. 27-14-403(c) and any amount awarded under W.S. 27-14-408 shall constitute the exclusive benefit for both the physical impairment and the economic loss resulting from an injury, including loss of earnings, extra expenses associated with the injury and vocational rehabilitation. An employee shall not receive benefits under this section if receiving benefits under W.S. 27-14-404 or 27-14-405.</p>
                  <p>(b) This section specifies the length of time amounts computed pursuant to W.S. 27-14-403(c) are to be awarded and except for amounts awarded under W.S. 27-14-408, shall not be construed to allow awards in excess of the amounts computed pursuant to W.S. 27-14-403(c).</p>
                  <p>(c) Any objection to a final determination pursuant to this section shall be referred to the medical commission for hearing by a medical hearing panel acting as hearing examiner pursuant to W.S. 27-14-616.</p>

                  <p>(a) An injured employee may apply to the division to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program if:</p>
                  <p>(i) An award has been made under W.S. 27-14-405(f) and (g) or it is reasonably expected, due to the nature and extent of the injury, that an award will be made under W.S. 27-14-405(f) and (g);</p>
                  <p>(ii) The compensable injury will prevent the employee from returning to any occupation for which the employee has previous training or experience and in which the employee was gainfully employed at any time during the three (3) year period before the injury;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The employee's injury has not previously resulted in an award for vocational disability, whether denominated loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity or vocational award; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The employee elects in writing to accept vocational rehabilitation instead of any permanent partial disability award under W.S. 27-14-405(h) and (j) arising from the same physical injury.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon receipt of an application, the division shall determine if the employee is eligible for participation in a rehabilitation program pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon final determination of an injured worker's eligibility for rehabilitation, the division shall immediately send a copy of the application and determination to the local office of the division of vocational rehabilitation of the department of workforce services.</p>
                  <p>(d) The division of vocational rehabilitation shall upon receipt of the determination of eligibility, immediately provide the injured employee with a written explanation of the rehabilitation services available to injured employees and its procedures for developing and supervising an individualized rehabilitation plan for the employee.</p>
                  <p>(e) The division of vocational rehabilitation shall in cooperation with the injured employee, develop an individualized rehabilitation plan for the employee agreed to by both the division of vocational rehabilitation and employee, that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is reasonably contemplated to restore the employee's ability to return to former employment, a related occupation or other suitable employment which, to the extent reasonably possible, has an earnings level comparable to the employee's pre-injury earnings;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Shall not exceed five (5) years or a total cost of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) unless extended or increased for extenuating circumstances as defined by rule and regulation of the division;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Is the least costly feasible plan consistent with the rehabilitation goal established pursuant to paragraph (e)(i) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Includes provisions for living expenses during the rehabilitation plan if the employee is not receiving payments for living expenses from any other government benefit program including worker's compensation, and other sources of household income are insufficient to pay minimally necessary living expenses, provided the vocational rehabilitation program is pursued as rapidly as possible.</p>
                  <p>(f) The division may modify, suspend or terminate the participation of an injured worker in the rehabilitation program upon certification by the division of vocational rehabilitation that the injured worker has failed to cooperate or maintain satisfactory progress toward the mutually agreed upon rehabilitation plan goals.</p>

                  <p>(a) Within thirty (30) days after accepting the case of an injured employee and within thirty (30) days after each examination or treatment, a health care provider or a hospital shall file without charge a written medical report with the division. Upon request, the division shall provide a copy of the report to the employer or employee. The division shall notify the employer and the employee that they shall be provided a copy of the report upon request. The report shall state the nature of the injury, the diagnosis, prognosis and prescribed treatment. Any health care provider or hospital failing or refusing to file the report or transmit copies within the time prescribed by this subsection or presenting a claim for services not reasonably justified or which was not required as a result of the work related injury shall forfeit any remuneration or award under this act for services rendered or facilities furnished the employee. Fees or portions of fees for injury related services or products rendered shall not be billed to or collected from the injured employee. Any tests to be administered or other services proposed to be rendered by a health care provider which are clearly not germane to the injury shall be disclosed to the injured employee, if possible, and the employee shall be advised that the cost of the tests or services will be the responsibility of the employee if he consents to the tests or services. Any other necessary and reasonable test or report including initial and necessary follow-up testing for blood borne pathogens, which may be required by division policy or requested by the division, employer or employee may be paid in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the division. The division shall by rule and regulation institute an appropriate policy for testing for blood borne pathogens after possible occupational exposure and for immediate prophylactic treatment if medically indicated, and shall inform hospitals and primary health care providers of this policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any health care provider attending an employee injured while engaged in any employment covered under this act and certifying temporary total disability under W.S. 27-14-404 shall examine the employee before certification and shall without charge file a written report with the division. Prior to each period of subsequent recertification of temporary total disability, the health care provider shall reexamine the employee and file without charge a written report with the division. In addition, the health care provider shall as soon as practical notify the division upon releasing an injured employee from temporary total disability. Upon request, the division, without delay, shall transmit copies to the employer or employee. The report shall specify reasons for temporary total disability or continued temporary total disability and is subject to the time limitations and penalties imposed under subsection (a) of this section. Any health care provider certifying or recertifying temporary total disability without an examination of the employee shall be reported to the state licensing board for the respective health care provider.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any bill for medical and hospital care which is not properly dated, itemized and certified by the claimant may be disallowed by the division.</p>
                  <p>(d) Within thirty (30) days after the first of the month succeeding the month in which services were rendered to the injured employee, itemized bills and claims for medical and hospital care shall be filed with the division. The division shall upon request provide copies to the employee or employer. Any bill or claim not filed by the claimant in accordance with this subsection may result in a denial of the bill or claim.</p>
                  <p>(e) An initial claim for temporary total disability benefits under W.S. 27-14-404 and any subsequent claim for temporary total disability following the initial period of certification shall be filed with the division and the division shall transmit a copy of the initial claim to the employer. Failure to file a claim for temporary total disability in accordance with W.S. 27-14-404(d) shall result in denial of the claim.</p>
                  <p>(f) A claim for permanent impairment or disability benefits under W.S. 27-14-405 and 27-14-406 and a claim for death benefits under W.S. 27-14-403 shall be filed with the division.</p>

                  <p>(a) As soon as is practical but not later than seventy-two (72) hours after the general nature of the injury became apparent, an injured employee shall, in writing or by other means approved by the department, report the occurrence and general nature of the accident or injury to the employer. In addition, the injured employee shall within ten (10) days after the injury became apparent, file an injury report with the employer and the division in a manner and containing information prescribed by division rule and regulation. If the injured employee is physically unable to comply, a personal representative of the employee, his dependents or a personal representative of the dependents in case of death shall, following notification by the employer or department of reporting requirements, make and file the report for the injured employee.</p>
                  <p>(b) If an injured employee, any dependent or personal representative makes a written report of the injury to the employer or his representative, the employer shall acknowledge receipt of the report in writing either upon the report or a copy of the report.</p>
                  <p>(c) Failure of the injured employee, any dependent or personal representative to report the accident or injury to the employer and to file the injury report in accordance with subsection (a) of this section is a presumption that the claim shall be denied. The presumption may be rebutted if the employee establishes by clear and convincing evidence a lack of prejudice to the employer or division in investigating the injury and in monitoring medical treatment.</p>
                  <p>(d) The filing of an employee's injury report under this section is a release of information for the duration of the benefit period and upon request and upon notice to the employee, any medical care provider, physician or hospital treating the employee for the injury shall release medical records pertaining to the injury to the division or the employer.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon receipt, the division shall review the initial injury reports to determine if the injury or death resulting from injury is compensable and within the jurisdiction of this act. No subsequent claim for compensation under this act shall be approved if the division determines the injury or death is not compensable and under the jurisdiction of this act or if the employer states on his injury report that the injury is not compensable, until a determination is rendered by the division. The division shall provide notice of its determination to the employee, employer and the claimant.</p>
                  <p>(b) Following review of each bill and claim for medical and hospital care pursuant to W.S. 27-14-401(b), the division may approve or deny payment of all or portions of the entire amount claimed and shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Notify the employee and the health care provider in writing of any portion of a claim for which the employee may be liable for payment;</p>

                  <p>(d) Upon receipt of a claim for impairment, disability or death benefits filed under W.S. 27-14-403(g) or 27-14-501(e) and</p>
                  <p>(f) and if the initial injury or death resulting from injury is determined compensable and within the jurisdiction of this act, the division shall determine if the injured employee or his dependents are eligible for benefits and shall approve or deny the claim in accordance with this act. If a claim is approved, the division shall determine the amount of the award for compensation in accordance with W.S. 27-14-403 through 27-14-406 and 27-14-408, if applicable. The division shall provide notice of any determination under this subsection to the employer, employee and the claimant.</p>
                  <p>(e) In accordance with this act, the division shall by rule and regulation establish necessary procedures for the review and settlement of the compensability of an injury or death resulting from injury and of claims filed under this act through interviews with employees, employers and health care personnel or through review of written reports. Nothing in this act shall prohibit the employer or division from reaching a settlement of up to two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) under this subsection in any one (1) case without an admission of compensability or that the injury was work related.</p>
                  <p>(f) A health care provider receiving payment erroneously under this act pursuant to a determination by the division following review and settlement under subsection (e) of this section or a decision by a hearing examiner is liable for repayment to the worker's compensation account. Except in contested cases, the division may deduct the amount liable from future payments under this act limited to deduction of those mistaken payments made for services provided within twelve (12) months before the deduction. If necessary, the division may recover repayment by civil action as provided in W.S. 27-14-511.</p>
                  <p>(g) No claim for benefits under this act shall be denied based solely on the failure of the employer to have complied with the requirements of this act.</p>
                  <p>(h) If any claim under W.S. 27-14-404 through 27-14-406 which has been approved and for which an employee is receiving benefits is objected to by an employer, the employee shall be notified by the division within one (1) working day of the objection.</p>
                  <p>(j) Notice to any employee or his dependents under this section of a final determination by the division denying the compensability of an initial injury, a claim for medical or hospital care for which the employee or his dependents may be liable for payment or denying any impairment, disability or death benefit, shall include reasons for denial and a statement of the employee's or his dependents' rights to a hearing before a hearing examiner as provided by this act and to legal representation.</p>

                  <p>(iv) Any interested party may request a hearing before a hearing examiner on the final determination of the division by filing a written request for hearing with the division within fifteen (15) days after the date the notice of the final determination was mailed by the division. If the division has not rendered a final determination within sixty (60) days following the date the claim was filed, any interested party may request a hearing before a hearing examiner in the manner prescribed by this paragraph. The date a written request for hearing is filed shall be determined pursuant to W.S. 16-4-301(a);</p>
                  <p>(v) Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the division shall immediately provide notice of the request to the appropriate hearing authority as determined pursuant to W.S. 27-14-616;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If timely written request for hearing is not filed, the final determination by the division pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to further administrative or judicial review, provided however that, in its own discretion, the division may, whenever benefits have been denied to a worker, make a redetermination within one (1) year after the date of an original determination regardless of whether or not a party has filed a timely appeal pursuant to paragraph (iv) of this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(n) The division shall maintain a complete and current file for every worker's compensation case filed with the division in accordance with this act.</p>
                  <p>(o) The division pursuant to its rules and regulations may issue a determination of preauthorization for an injured worker's nonemergency hospitalization, surgery or other specific medical care, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The division's determination that the worker suffered a compensable injury is final and not currently subject to contested case or judicial review;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A claim for preauthorization is filed by a health care provider on behalf of the injured worker;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The division's determination pursuant to this subsection is issued in accordance with the procedures provided in subsection (k) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Following a final determination to preauthorize, the necessity of the hospitalization, surgery or specific medical care shall not be subject to further review and providers' bills shall be reviewed only for relatedness to the preauthorized care and reasonableness in accord with the division's fee schedules.</p>

                  <p>(a) A hearing examiner designated by the office of administrative hearings created by W.S. 9-2-2201 shall conduct contested cases under this act in accordance with this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon receipt of a request for hearing from the division as provided in W.S. 27-14-601(k)(v), the case shall be determined by a hearing examiner in accordance with the law in effect at the time of the injury as a small claims hearing or as a contested case hearing subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) A request for hearing shall be conducted as a small claims hearing if the amount at issue is less than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), is not an issue of the compensability of the injury pursuant to W.S. 27-14-601(a) and the division requests the hearing be held as a small claims hearing. The division shall provide notice that it seeks a small claims hearing under this paragraph in the notice of request for hearing filed pursuant to W.S. 27-14-601(k)(v). If the division provides such notice, the hearing shall be a small claims hearing unless a party to the hearing objects within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice of request, in which case the hearing officer shall review the file and determine if a small claims hearing is appropriate or if a contested case hearing is necessary or appropriate. Each party to the hearing may within thirty (30) days from the date of notice of request, submit to the hearing examiner any written evidence and argument on the issue. The hearing officer may require either party to provide such documents, filings and evidence as the hearing officer deems relevant to the issue. Copies of the material submitted to the hearing examiner shall be mailed or delivered to all opposing parties. In addition, each party may submit rebuttal evidence and argument to the hearing examiner within forty-five (45) days following the date of notice of request for hearing. Upon request of any party to the hearing and at the discretion of the hearing officer, any proceeding under this paragraph may be conducted in person or by telephone. The hearing examiner shall review the case and written submissions and render a written decision not more than seventy-five (75) days following referral of the request for hearing. No attorney fees or other costs shall be allowed by the hearing examiner on behalf of or for any party to a hearing under this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>In addition, the attorney general's office shall not represent or directly assist the division in the preparation for a hearing under this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All other requests for hearing not specified under paragraph (b)(i) of this section shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure as applicable under rules of the office of administrative hearings. The hearing examiner designated by the office of administrative hearings shall render a decision in a contested case within thirty (30) days after the close of the record. If the contested case is heard by the hearing panel created pursuant to W.S. 27-14-616(b)(iv), the panel shall render a decision within forty-five (45) days after the close of the record;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Appeals may be taken from the decision rendered in any small claims hearing or contested case hearing by any affected party to the district court as provided by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Hearings under this section shall be held at a location mutually convenient to the parties, as determined by the hearing officer. If the injury occurs at a location outside Wyoming, the hearing shall be held in the county in which the employer’s principal place of business is located, unless the hearing officer determines a different location is more convenient to the parties;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section involving multiple sites may be conducted through audio or video conferencing at the discretion of the hearing officer or hearing panel.</p>
                  <p>(c) All written reports, claims and other documents filed with the division shall be considered as pleadings in the case. The attorney general's office shall represent the division in all contested cases. The hearing examiner has exclusive jurisdiction to make the final administrative determination of the validity and amount of compensation payable under this act. Except as otherwise specified in this subsection, all court costs shall be paid from the worker's compensation account if the judgment is in favor of the employer or the division. If judgment is against the employer and the employer contested the claim without being joined in the contest by the division, the court costs shall be paid by the employer. When the employer or division prevails, the court costs shall not affect the employer's experience rating. If judgment is against a health care provider, the court costs shall be paid by the health care provider.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon request, the hearing examiner may appoint an attorney to represent the employee or claimants and may allow the appointed attorney a reasonable fee for his services at the conclusion of the proceeding. An appointed attorney shall be paid according to the order of the hearing examiner either from the worker's compensation account, from amounts awarded to the employee or claimants or from the employer. In any contested case where the issue is the compensability of an injury, a prevailing employer's attorney fees shall also be paid according to the order of the hearing examiner from the worker's compensation account, not to affect the employer's experience rating. An award of attorney's fees shall be for a reasonable number of hours and shall not exceed the benefits at issue in the contested case hearing. In all other cases if the employer or division prevails, the attorney's fees allowed an employee's attorney shall not affect the employer's experience rating.</p>
                  <p>Attorney fees allowed shall be at an hourly rate established by the director of the office of administrative hearings and any application for attorney's fees shall be supported by a verified itemization of all services provided. No fee shall be awarded in any case in which the hearing examiner determines the claim or objection to be frivolous and without legal or factual justification. If the division or a hearing examiner determines that an injured worker's failure to meet any procedural deadline in this act is through the fault of the worker's attorney, the division shall reconsider its determination or a hearing examiner shall order the contested case returned to the division for redetermination of the contested issues as provided in W.S. 27-14-601(k).</p>
                  <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided within this subsection, all documents filed with the division under subsection (c) of this section may be maintained by the division on computer and the hearing examiner or court may admit into evidence any documents resident in the computer imaging file. If a genuine issue as to the authenticity of the document is raised by a party, by a hearing examiner or by the court, the hearing examiner or court may, before admitting the document into evidence, require the division to certify that the record is a true and correct copy or transcript of records on file in the division.</p>

                  <p>(a) The burden of proof in contested cases involving injuries which occur over a substantial period of time is on the employee to prove by competent medical authority that his claim arose out of and in the course of his employment and to prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is a direct causal connection between the condition or circumstances under which the work is performed and the injury;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the employment;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The injury can fairly be traced to the employment as a proximate cause;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The injury does not come from a hazard to which employees would have been equally exposed outside of the employment; and</p>
                  <p>(v) The injury is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee.</p>
                  <p>(b) Benefits for employment-related coronary conditions except those directly and solely caused by an injury, are not payable unless the employee establishes by competent medical authority that:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is a direct causal connection between the condition under which the work was performed and the cardiac condition; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The causative exertion occurs during the actual period of employment stress clearly unusual to or abnormal for employees in that particular employment, irrespective of whether the employment stress is unusual to or abnormal for the individual employee; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The acute symptoms of the cardiac condition are clearly manifested not later than four (4) hours after the alleged causative exertion.</p>
                  <p>(c) If an employee suffers a hernia, he is entitled to compensation if he clearly proves that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The hernia is of recent origin;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Its appearance was accompanied by pain;</p>
                  <p>(iii) It was immediately preceded by some accidental strain suffered in the course of the employment; and</p>

                  <p>(a) In any contested proceeding, the hearing examiner may appoint a duly qualified impartial health care provider to examine the employee and give testimony. The fee for the service shall be as ordered by the hearing examiner, with mileage allowance as is allowed to other witnesses to be assessed as costs and paid as other witness fees are paid.

The fees and costs shall be charged in the same manner as other costs and witness fees.

Following referral by the division, the hearing examiner or medical hearing panel shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide all issues related to the written notice of objection filed pursuant to W.S. 27-14-601(k). Different medical hearing panels with different membership may be selected to hear different cases, but a panel may hear more than one (1) case.

                  <p>(d) The division shall establish a fee schedule for the compensation of members of the medical commission and medical hearing panels for their professional services to be paid from the worker's compensation account.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon agreement of all parties to a case, the hearing examiner in a contested case under this chapter may transfer a medically contested case to a medical hearing panel or may seek the advice of the medical commission on specified medical issues in the contested case. The advice shall be in writing and shall become part of the record of the case.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any member of the commission who knows or has reasonable cause to believe or suspect that a health care provider or health care facility has provided substandard or inappropriate medical or health care shall immediately report it to the appropriate professional or facility licensing authority and to the division.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>27-14-704. Worker's compensation revenue bonds; department determination; issuance by state loan and investment board; bonding procedure, terms and conditions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The department may upon determining that the issuance of revenue bonds would be financially beneficial to the worker's compensation account and that bond issuance would not negatively impact employer contribution rates to the account, request the state loan and investment board to issue worker's compensation revenue bonds to fund awards and claims, program and administrative expenses and program reserves. Upon receipt of a request under this subsection, the state loan and investment board shall review the department's determination and if it concurs with the determination, the board may issue worker's compensation revenue bonds in one (1) or more series not to exceed an aggregate amount of two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000.00). The net proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall after payment of issuance costs, be deposited into the worker's compensation claims payment account established under W.S. 27-14-701(f).</p>
                  <p>(b) Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section are limited obligations payable solely from and secured by funds deposited within the worker's compensation account as created under W.S. 27-14-701(a) and the worker's compensation claims payment account. The bondholders may not look to any general or other fund for payment of the bonds except for revenues pledged therefor. The revenue bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness or a debt within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision or limitation. The bonds shall not be considered or held to be general obligations of the state but shall constitute limited obligations of the state and the board shall not pledge the state's full faith and credit for payment of the bonds. Each series of bonds may be issued by the board at public or private sale, in denominations and registered form, with such provision for conversion or exchange, for establishing interest rates or methods of determining rates on a variable or fixed rate basis, for establishing maturities and redemption provisions, as determined by the board. The bonds shall be payable at the office of a fiscal agent designated by the board. The state loan and investment board shall not issue any revenue bonds under this section unless the sale results in an economic benefit to the worker's compensation program as determined by the board. In all other respects, the board may prescribe the form and terms of the revenue bonds and shall do whatever is lawful and necessary for their issuance and payment. Action taken by the board under this section shall be approved by a majority of its members.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>27-15-102. Presumption of occupational disability; applicability; exceptions.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A firefighter who suffers from a listed disease is presumed to have developed that listed disease during the course and scope of employment. The listed disease is presumed to be an occupational disease, the dominant cause of which is the employment as a firefighter, unless the contrary is proven.</p>
                <p>(b) A presumption established under this act applies to a determination of whether a firefighter's injury, disease, illness, health impairment, disability or death resulted from a listed disease contracted in the course and scope of employment for purposes of benefits or compensation provided under:</p>
                <p>(i) Firefighter retirement and disability retirement plans administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 9-3-401 through 9-3-431, 15-5-201 through 15-5-209, 15-5-401 through 15-5-422 and 35-9-616 through 35-9-628;</p>
                <p>(ii) Workers' compensation benefits paid by or on behalf of an employer to an employee under the provisions of W.S. 27-14-101 through 27-14-806;</p>
                <p>(iii) University of Wyoming and Wyoming community college tuition and fees as provided under W.S. 21-16-1501(h) and (j).</p>
                <p>(c) The presumption in subsection (a) of this section applies only to a firefighter who:</p>
                <p>(i) Is employed for not less than the minimum period of employment and seeks the presumption within:</p>
                <p>(A) Ten (10) years after cessation of employment for a listed disease as defined by W.S. 27-15-101(a)(ii)(A);</p>
                <p>(B) One (1) year after cessation of employment for a listed disease as defined by W.S. 27-15-101(a)(ii)(B) or (C);</p>
                <p>(C) A period to be determined by the Wyoming worker's compensation medical commission for a listed disease as defined by W.S. 27-15-101(a)(ii)(D).</p>
                <p>(ii) Has been exposed to the hazards involved in firefighting during the minimum period of employment; and</p>
                <p>(iii) On becoming employed or during employment as a firefighter received a physical examination that failed to reveal evidence of the listed disease for which the presumption is sought.</p>
                <p>(d) The presumption in subsection (a) of this section does not apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If the listed disease is known to be caused by tobacco use and the firefighter:</p>
                <p>(A) Is a regular user of tobacco for five (5) or more years; or</p>
                <p>(B) Was a regular user of tobacco for five (5) or more years and it has been fewer than ten (10) years since the firefighter gave up the use of tobacco products.</p>
                <p>(ii) In a cause of action brought in a state or federal court except for judicial review of a proceeding in which there has been a grant or denial of employment-related benefits or compensation.</p>
                <p>(e) This act does not create a cause of action.</p>
                <p>(f) This act does not enlarge or establish a right to any benefit or compensation or eligibility for any benefit or compensation.</p>
                <p>(g) A firefighter who qualifies for a presumption established under this act is entitled only to the benefits or compensation to which the firefighter would otherwise be entitled to receive at the time the claim for benefits or compensation is filed.</p>
                <p>(h) A presumption under this act is not limited to the current listed diseases. A firefighter is not precluded from a case-by-case demonstration before the Wyoming workers' compensation medical commission that the dominant cause of the firefighter's disease, illness, health impairment or disability is or was employment as a firefighter.</p>
                <p>(j) Paragraph (d)(i) of this section only prevents the application of the presumption authorized by this chapter and does not affect the right of a firefighter to provide proof, without the use of the presumption, that an injury, disease, illness, health impairment or disability occurred during the course and scope of employment.</p>
