                  <p>(v) Not later than fifteen (15) days after a school receives its overall performance rating or other performance determination from the department of education, the school district may seek an informal review with the state board. The state board shall make a final determination as to the overall performance rating or other performance determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of the request for review;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The state board shall promulgate rules and regulations governing the informal review process before the board as conducted under this subsection. The informal review process shall only examine whether the department properly computed and reported a school's overall performance rating or other performance determination or whether the school was unable to administer the statewide assessment. The state board may grant an exception to the state's accountability system requirements for a school for one (1) school year when the school demonstrates that it was unable to administer the statewide assessment for good cause. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, the informal review process shall not be used to grant exceptions to the state's accountability system or change components of the accountability model.</p>
                  <p>(e) The state board, through the department of education, shall establish long term and interim performance targets for all Wyoming schools for the indicators measured pursuant to subsections (c) and (n) of this section. The performance targets may be developed in consultation with one (1) or more advisory committees of education stakeholders. The state board shall utilize the performance targets in carrying out the duties and the deliberative process required under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) The state board, through the department of education, shall compile, evaluate and determine target levels for an overall school performance rating and for indicator level performance. The board shall execute this determination when a significant aspect of the school accountability system changes through a prescribed deliberative process informed by a panel selected by the state board comprised of broad based representation from both public education and the community at- large. The target levels for school performance shall be used by the state board through the department to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Identify four (4) levels of school performance tied to the overall school performance rating that demonstrate a range of performance levels as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Exceeding expectations including those schools performing above standards in all measured areas;</p>
                  <p>(B) Meeting expectations;</p>
                  <p>(C) Partially meeting expectations; and</p>
                  <p>(D) Not meeting expectations.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Further measure performance specified under paragraph (i) of this subsection by identifying indicator level performance in all areas specified by subsection (n) of this section for alternative schools and subsection (c) of this section for all other schools and from this analysis determine schools that are exceeding, meeting or are below targets in each content area;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Coordinate the target levels, school and indicator level determinations with the availability of the system of support, including comprehensive and targeted support and interventions administered in accordance with subsection (h) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 195, § 4.</p>
                  <p>(h) For all schools a progressive system of support and intervention to assist schools shall be established by the state board through the department. The system shall increase the ability of schools and school districts to improve achievement and growth indicator performance and expand the ability for schools and school districts within the state to continuously improve. The system shall clearly identify and prescribe the actions for each level of support, including comprehensive and targeted support and intervention. The state superintendent shall take action based upon system results according to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 101, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 101, § 2.</p>

                  <p>(iv) Repealed by Laws 2017, Ch. 95, § 5.</p>
                  <p>(v) Schools designated as partially meeting expectations shall file an improvement plan with the school district superintendent and the department that identifies and addresses all content and indicator areas where performance is below target levels. The plan shall be based upon an evaluation of the strengths and deficiencies of specific indicator scores that identifies appropriate improvement goals with an explanation of the measures and methods chosen for improvement, the processes to be implemented to deliver the improvement measures, identification of relevant timelines and benchmarks and an articulation of the process for measuring success of the methods chosen to increase performance. The plan shall also include review of the design and implementation of the district's leader evaluation system developed pursuant to W.S. 21-2-304(b)(xvi) and 21-3-110(a)(xxx). The state superintendent shall appoint a representative in accordance with paragraph</p>
                  <p>(vii) of this subsection to monitor the school's progress towards meeting the specified goals and implementation of the processes, measures and methods as contained in the school's plan. The representative shall assist the district in identifying and securing the necessary resources to support the goals as stated by the school and the district. Failure to meet improvement goals as specified in the plan for two (2) consecutive years may require that the school be subject to paragraph (vi) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Schools designated as not meeting expectations shall file an improvement plan in accordance with paragraph (v) of this subsection that identifies and addresses all content and indicator areas where performance is below target levels. The plan shall include review of the design and implementation of the district's leader evaluation system developed pursuant to W.S. 21-2-304(b)(xvi) and 21-3-110(a)(xxx). In addition, the evaluation of a district's student assessment system as provided by paragraph (vii) of this subsection may be undertaken in that school year immediately following any school year in which a school within the district has been designated as not meeting expectations. The state superintendent shall appoint a representative in accordance with paragraph (vii) of this subsection to assist in drafting the improvement plan, including the selection of programs and interventions to improve student performance. The representative shall perform duties as required by paragraph (v) of this subsection. The plan shall be recommended by the school district superintendent and approved by the local board of trustees prior to submission to the department. The plan shall describe the personnel and financial resources within the education resource block grant model as defined by W.S. 21-13-101(a)(xiv) necessary for implementation of the measures and methods chosen for improvement and shall specify how resources shall be reallocated, if necessary, to improve student performance;</p>
                  <p>(vii) A representative shall be appointed by the state superintendent, in consultation with the local board of trustees, for all schools designated under paragraphs (v) and</p>
                  <p>(vi) of this subsection to serve as a liaison between the school district leadership and the department. The representative shall be an employee of the department, an employee of a Wyoming school district or any combination, and may require more than one (1) individual for schools requiring substantial intervention and support. Additionally, one (1) representative may be assigned to more than one (1) school. Among other duties as may be requested by the district or department, the representative shall review and provide suggestions on the improvement plans submitted by schools in accordance with paragraphs (v) and (vi) of this subsection, and may review and evaluate district student assessment systems implemented under W.S. 21-3-110(a)(xxiv) to ensure alignment with the uniform state education standards. After one (1) year of a school not meeting expectations under paragraph (vi) of this subsection, approval of the improvement plan by the representative appointed under this subsection shall be required. Requested resources for improvement plan implementation, or the reallocation of existing resources for plan implementation, shall be based upon a comprehensive review of the available research. Justification for resource allocation or reallocation shall be incorporated within the written improvement plan. The representative shall possess expertise appropriate to particular strategies incorporated within improvement plans to enable necessary plan evaluation, and shall be commensurate with the level of intervention and support to be administered under this subsection. The state superintendent shall annually report to the state board on the progress of each school in meeting annual goals and overall improvement targets, fully describing the effectiveness and deficiencies of efforts to improve school performance in performance categories prescribed by this section;</p>
                  <p>(viii) To the extent permitted by law and rule and regulation, plans submitted in compliance with paragraphs (v) and (vi) of this subsection shall serve to comply with similar requirements administered by the state superintendent and the department, and the state board shall ensure the plans minimize submission of duplicative information, material and the administrative burdens placed upon schools. In addition, the following shall apply to the plans submitted under this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(A) All plans submitted under this subsection shall be made available for public inspection through internet access as defined by W.S. 9-2-1035(a)(iii);</p>
                  <p>(B) Schools designated as partially meeting expectations under paragraph (v) of this subsection or designated as not meeting expectations under paragraph (vi) of this subsection shall file the required improvement plan the first year of designation and submit yearly updates on the progress towards the goals and strategies outlined in the improvement plan so long as the school maintains the same performance designation.</p>
                  <p>(ix) In addition to paragraphs (v) through (viii) of this subsection, the state board shall administer this subsection as part of school district accreditation required under W.S. 21-2-304(a)(ii), through appropriate administrative action taken in accordance with W.S. 21-2-304(b)(ii).</p>
                  <p>(j) Measured performance results obtained and collected pursuant to this section, together with subsequent actions responding to results, shall be combined with other information and measures maintained and acquired under W.S. 21-2-202(a)(xxi), 21-2-304(a)(v)(H), 21-3-110(a)(xxiv) and otherwise by law, to be used as the basis of a statewide system for providing periodic and uniform reporting on the progress of state public education achievement compared to established targets. The statewide accountability system shall include a process for consolidating, coordinating and analyzing existing performance data and reports for purposes of aligning with the requirements of this section and for determinations of student achievement incorporated into the statewide system. In establishing a reporting system under this subsection, the department shall describe the performance of each public school in Wyoming. The performance report shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Include an overall school performance rating along with ratings for each of the indicators and content levels in the accountability system that:</p>
                  <p>(A) Supports the overall school performance rating; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Provides detailed information for analysis of school performance on the various components of the system.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-2-304. Duties of the state board of education.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The state board of education shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Establish policies for public education in this state consistent with the Wyoming Constitution and statutes and may promulgate rules necessary or desirable for the proper and effective implementation of this title and its responsibilities under this title. Nothing in this section shall give the state board rulemaking authority in any area specifically delegated to the state superintendent;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Through the evaluation and accreditation of school districts, implement and enforce the uniform standards for educational programs prescribed under W.S. 21-9-101 and 21-9-102 in the public schools of this state, including any educational institution receiving any state funds except for the University of Wyoming and Wyoming community colleges, and implement and enforce the statewide education accountability system pursuant to W.S. 21-2-204. The board shall ensure that educational programs offered by public schools in accordance with these standards provide students an opportunity to acquire sufficient knowledge and skills, at a minimum, to enter the University of Wyoming and Wyoming community colleges, to prepare students for the job market or postsecondary vocational and technical training and to achieve the general purposes of education that equips students for their role as a citizen and participant in the political system and to have the opportunity to compete both intellectually and economically in society. In addition, the board shall require school district adherence to the statewide education accountability system;</p>
                  <p>(iii) By rule and regulation and in consultation and coordination with local school districts, prescribe uniform student content and performance standards for the common core of knowledge and the common core of skills specified under W.S. 21-9-101(b), and promulgate uniform standards for programs addressing the special needs of student populations specified under W.S. 21-9-101(c) that ensure these student populations are provided the opportunity to learn the common core of knowledge and skills as prescribed by the uniform student content and performance standards pursuant to this paragraph. Student content and performance standards prescribed under this paragraph shall include standards for graduation from any high school within any school district of this state. The ability to prescribe content and performance standards shall not be construed to give the state board of education the authority to prescribe textbooks or curriculum which the state board is hereby forbidden to do. Graduation standards imposed under this paragraph shall require the successful completion of the following components, as evidenced by passing grades or by the successful performance on competency-based equivalency examinations:</p>
                  <p>(A) Four (4) school years of English;</p>
                  <p>(B) Three (3) school years of mathematics;</p>
                  <p>(C) Three (3) school years of science, one (1) year of which may be satisfied by one (1) year of computer science; and</p>
                  <p>(D) Three (3) school years of social studies, including history, American government and economic systems and institutions, provided business instructors may instruct classes on economic systems and institutions.</p>
                  <p>(iv) In consultation with local school districts, establish requirements for students to earn a high school diploma as evidenced by course completion and as measured by each district's assessment system prescribed by rule and regulation of the state board and required under W.S. 21-3-110(a)(xxiv). Once every five (5) years and on a staggered basis, the state board shall through the department, review and approve each district's assessment system designed to determine the various levels of student performance as aligned with the uniform state standards and the attainment of high school graduation requirements as evidenced by course completion. In addition and following review, refinement and revision of student content and performance standards adopted under paragraph (a)(iii) of this section and reviewed under subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section, the board shall establish a process to ensure district assessment systems are aligned with the refined and revised standards within three (3) full school years following adoption of revised standards;</p>
                  <p>(v) Through the state superintendent and in consultation and coordination with local school districts, implement a statewide assessment system comprised of a coherent system of measures that when combined, provide a reliable and valid measure of individual student achievement for each public school and school district within the state, and the performance of the state as a whole. Statewide assessment system components shall be in accordance with requirements of the statewide education accountability system pursuant to W.S. 21-2-204. Improvement of teaching and learning in schools, attaining student achievement targets for performance indicators established under W.S. 21-2-204 and fostering school program improvement shall be the primary purposes of statewide assessment of student performance in Wyoming. The statewide assessment system shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) Measure individual student performance and progress in a manner substantially aligned with the uniform educational program and student content and performance standards imposed by law and by board rule and regulation;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective school year 2017-2018, and each school year thereafter, be administered in specified grades aligned to the student content and performance standards, specifically assessing student performance in English language arts and mathematics in grades three (3) through ten (10). In addition, the statewide assessment system shall assess student performance in science in grades four (4), eight (8) and ten (10);</p>
                  <p>(C) Measure student performance in Wyoming on a comparative basis with student performance in other states;</p>
                  <p>(D) Measure year-to-year changes in student performance and progress in the subjects specified under subparagraph (a)(v)(B) of this section. The assessment system shall ensure the student performance measurements used at each grade level are valid for the purposes for which they are being used, including valid year-to-year comparisons of student and school level results, and shall be sufficient to produce necessary data to enable application of measures of performance indicators as required under W.S. 21-2-204;</p>
                  <p>(E) Include interim assessments aligned to the statewide content and performance standards and the statewide summative assessment. The interim assessments required by this subparagraph shall be optional for school districts to administer as a part of the district assessment system. The state board shall ensure results from the optional interim assessments are provided to school districts as soon as possible after completion of an interim assessment. All item types used on the statewide student summative assessment shall be included in interim assessments to the extent practical within the reporting timeline;</p>
                  <p>(F) Provide a fair and unbiased assessment of student performance without regard to race, ethnicity, limited English proficiency and socioeconomic status;</p>
                  <p>(G) Provide appropriate accommodations or alternative assessments to enable the assessment of students with disabilities as specified under W.S. 21-9-101(c)(i) and students with limited English proficiency;</p>
                  <p>(H) Provide a measure of accountability to enhance learning in Wyoming and in combination with other measures and information, assist school districts in determining individual student progress as well as school level achievement, growth and readiness targets. In addition to reporting requirements imposed under W.S. 21-2-204, the assessment results shall be reported to students, parents, schools, school districts and the public in an accurate, complete and timely manner. For schools with students enrolled in full-time virtual education programs, assessment results for students attending full-time virtual education programs shall be reported in aggregate form and separate from students physically attending class in a school facility. Assessment results shall be used in conjunction with each school district's assessments to design educational strategies for improvement and enhancement of student performance required under W.S. 21-2-204. Assessment results shall also be used to guide actions by the state board and the department in providing and directing a progressive system of support and intervention to districts in developing school improvement plans in response to student performance to attain target levels measured and established under W.S. 21-2-204.

                  <p>(a) The board shall promulgate rules and regulations:</p>
                  <p>(i) For the certification of school administrators, teachers and other personnel to require either examination in specified subjects or the completion of courses in approved institutions, or both. However, nothing in this article shall be construed as permitting the board to impose any additional requirements beyond licensure in his own profession on any person licensed pursuant to title 33 in order for that person to practice his own profession in the schools as an employee of or contractor for a school district. Board rules and regulations shall require the following minimum qualifications and any additional qualifications for additional training in a broad general education as the board may designate:</p>
                  <p>(A) For teachers, a degree from an accredited college or university;</p>
                  <p>(B) For administrators, qualification as a teacher pursuant to subparagraph (a)(i)(A) of this section in addition to appropriate experience as a teacher and additional training in educational administration.</p>
                  <p>(ii) In addition to paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the board shall by rule and regulation provide for:</p>
                  <p>(A) Certification of teachers of the Arapahoe and Shoshoni language and in its discretion, the board may make other exceptions as to both teachers and administrators it determines necessary and proper in special circumstances;</p>
                  <p>(B) Temporary employment as instructors of persons with extensive training or experience in a particular discipline if a certified teacher is not available. Those instructors shall be monitored and supervised by certified personnel;</p>
                  <p>(C) School district establishment of courses taught primarily by electronic transmission such as broadcast through satellites which do not require the presence of a teacher certified in the subject matter being taught by this alternative method.</p>

                  <p>(b) The board may enter into reciprocal agreements with other states for the purposes of granting certification pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board may revoke, suspend, deny or refuse to renew certification for incompetency, conviction of a felony committed after July 1, 1996, immorality and other reprehensible conduct or gross neglect of duty or knowing misrepresentation of information on an application or resume, upon its own motion or upon the petition of any local board of trustees. Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, no certificate shall be revoked or suspended without a hearing conducted in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, unless the person holding the certification waives the right to a hearing.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board may establish reasonable fees for application and issuance of certification under this section and may require the payment of fees as a condition for issuing any certificate.

Fees collected by the board pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited with the state treasurer. Upon receipt, the state treasurer shall credit the revenues to a separate account. Expenditures from the account shall be for expenses incurred by the board in administering this article.</p>
                  <p>(e) No certification shall be issued under this section until a criminal history background check has been filed with and received by the board, the applicant provides a release of information and the applicant consents to the release of any criminal history information to the board and if applicable, to the employing school district. Upon receipt of a background report pursuant to this subsection indicating that the applicant has a conviction equal to a felony under Wyoming law or any conviction for an act which would constitute a violation under chapter 2 or chapter 4 of title 6 of the Wyoming statutes, the board shall immediately provide a copy of the report to the employing local school board if the information involves a certified individual employed by that local board and if the local board has requested a copy of the report. For all persons seeking initial certification under this section on or after July 1, 1996:</p>
                  <p>(i) The applicant shall be required to verify under oath whether he has been convicted of a felony. The board may deny certification of any applicant who has been convicted of a felony that relates to the practice of teaching or to the ability to practice as a teacher and may annul a certificate for misrepresentation by an applicant of his criminal history. Any felony related to a sexual offense shall be considered to relate to the practice of teaching. Action by the board to annul a certificate shall be taken following a hearing conducted in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, unless the person holding the certification waives the right to a hearing;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The applicant shall provide to the board fingerprints and other information necessary for a criminal history record background check as provided in W.S. 7-19-201(a).</p>
                  <p>(f) Any local school board dismissing or accepting the resignation of a person holding certification under this section shall notify the professional standards teaching board of the dismissal or resignation, if the dismissal or acceptance of the resignation was based in whole or in part upon the person's conviction of a felony.</p>

                  <p>(i) "Convicted" or "conviction" means an unvacated determination of guilt by any court having legal jurisdiction of the offense and from which no appeal is pending. Pleas of guilty and nolo contendere shall be deemed convictions for the purposes of this section.

                  <p>(ii) "Felony" means a criminal offense for which the penalty authorized by law includes imprisonment in a state penal institution for more than one (1) year.

                  <p>(j) Nothing in this section authorizes the board to establish qualifications of persons exempt from certification requirements pursuant to W.S. 21-7-303(b).</p>
                  <p>(k) Upon receipt from the department of family services of a certified copy of an order from a court to withhold, suspend or otherwise restrict a license issued by the board, the board shall notify the party named in the court order of the withholding, suspension or restriction of the license in accordance with the terms of the court order. No appeal under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act shall be allowed for a license withheld, suspended or restricted under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(m) In accordance with criteria and guidelines established by the state superintendent of public instruction, the board shall submit data elements collected from school administrators, teachers and other school district personnel certified under this article to the department of education for housing in the department's data base repository.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person may apply to the district board for the establishment of a new charter school or a charter school within a school to be located within the school district.</p>
                  <p>(b) Administrators and teachers employed by the district, parents of students enrolled in the district and any special district advisory group comprised of district residents may apply to the district board to convert an existing public school operating within the school district to a charter school. An application filed under this subsection shall demonstrate the support of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the teachers employed by the school who teach at the school proposed to be converted, and the parents of fifty percent (50%) of all students attending the school proposed to be converted.</p>
                  <p>(c) Instead of establishing a new charter school or a converted charter school under this section, a district board and a charter school applicant may by mutual agreement establish a charter school within a school. A charter school operated under this subsection is a separate school and shall have the rights and obligations provided under this article for new and converted charter schools. The agreement between the school board and the charter school may provide that faculty and staff at the charter school may work in both the charter school established under this subsection and other district schools. If district students attend both the charter school established under this subsection and another district school, the students shall be counted for each school in proportion to the percentage of their time spent in each school.</p>

Any mediation process prescribed by rule shall specify professional requirements for the impartial third party facilitating mediation. If either party refuses to mediate, the dispute may be appealed to the state board as provided in W.S. 21-3-310.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-3-401. Reading assessment and intervention.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Each school district shall select and implement a reading assessment and intervention program that uses an instrument that screens for signs of dyslexia and other reading difficulties as early as possible in kindergarten through grade three (3) and that implements with fidelity an evidence based intervention program. The program shall include instruments that monitor and measure reading progress and assess student reading skills and progress to provide data that informs any intervention. The assessment and intervention program shall be administered to all students in kindergarten through grade three (3). The program shall also include implementation of evidence based core curricula aligned to the uniform content and performance standards and evidenced based interventions to meet the needs of all students. The program shall be multi-tiered and shall include evidence based interventions to facilitate remediation of any reading difficulty as early as possible.</p>
                  <p>(b) Students not showing appropriate reading competence under this section shall be placed on an individualized reading plan to remedy the reading related difficulty utilizing an appropriate evidence based intervention program, which may include a group reading plan. For students under an individualized education program (IEP) which addresses reading difficulties, the IEP shall be deemed sufficient to meet the requirements of this subsection and no additional plan shall be required.</p>
                  <p>(c) Each district shall annually report to the department of education on the progress of each of its schools toward achieving the goal of eighty-five percent (85%) of all students reading at grade level upon completion of the third grade. The report shall include the percentage of students meeting or exceeding proficiency levels for the annual reporting period. The reporting shall also include the aggregate number of students identified by the screening instruments as having signs of dyslexia or other reading difficulties in addition to listing the evidence based interventions implemented in each district by grade. This report shall include kindergarten through grade three (3) progress toward achieving the goal of eighty-five percent (85%) proficiency in the specific skills known to be predictive of grade three (3) reading proficiency and that are listed in subsection (d) of this section. Grade three (3) reading proficiency shall be determined by the grade three (3) statewide assessment administered pursuant to W.S. 21-2- 304(a)(v). Each school not meeting the eighty-five percent (85%) goal specified under this subsection shall submit an improvement plan to the school district, and the school district shall submit an overall improvement plan to the department. At a minimum, each school and district improvement plan shall outline its general strategy for increasing reading proficiency for the next school year and shall specifically address the evidence based program of instruction, assessment and intervention being implemented, the specific training in those programs that reading teachers have received, the student-teacher ratio, the use of certified tutors and the use of instructional facilitators and paraprofessionals in kindergarten through grade three (3) trained in the delivery of the evidence based instruction and intervention program selected by the district.</p>
                  <p>(d) The state superintendent, in consultation with Wyoming school districts, professionals in the area of dyslexia and other reading difficulties, and other appropriate stakeholders, shall promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to assist each school district to administer its reading assessment and intervention program pursuant to this section and to assess the skills in paragraphs (i) through (v) of this subsection using a curriculum-independent assessment. The rules shall provide mechanisms for the state superintendent to directly support schools and school districts in meeting the goals of improvement plans developed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section including, but not limited to, professional development in evidence based literacy instruction and intervention and professional development in identifying the signs of dyslexia and other reading difficulties. To accomplish the purposes of this subsection, the department of education shall collect kindergarten through grade two (2) statewide longitudinal data from assessments selected and performed by each school district, which measures the following specific skills that evidence based research has concluded are predictive of grade three (3) reading proficiency:</p>
                  <p>(i) Phonological awareness;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Phonics;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Decoding words and nonwords;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Oral reading fluency; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Reading comprehension.</p>

                  <p>(a) For the purposes of this article:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Unexcused absence" means the absence, as defined in the policies of the local board of trustees, of any child required by this article to attend school when such absence is not excused to the satisfaction of the board of trustees by the parent, guardian, or other person having control of such child;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Habitual truant" means any child with five (5) or more unexcused absences in any one (1) school year;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Private school" is any nonpublic, elementary or secondary school providing a basic academic educational program for children and may include parochial and church or religious schools and home-based educational programs;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Parochial, church or religious school" is one operated under the auspices or control of a local church or religious congregation or a denomination established to promote and promulgate the commonly held religious doctrines of the group though it may also include basic academic subjects in its curriculum. Nothing contained in W.S. 21-4-102(b), 21-2-401 or 21-2-406 grants to the state of Wyoming or any of its officers, agencies or subdivisions any right or authority to control, manage, supervise or make any suggestions as to the control, management or supervision of any parochial, church or religious school which meets the requirements of W.S. 21-2-406(a);</p>
                  <p>(v) A home-based educational program means a program of educational instruction provided to a child by the child's parent or legal guardian or by a person designated by the parent or legal guardian. An instructional program provided to more than one (1) family unit does not constitute a home-based educational program;</p>
                  <p>(vi) "Basic academic educational program" is one that provides a sequentially progressive curriculum of fundamental instruction in reading, writing, mathematics, civics, history, literature and science. These curriculum requirements do not require any private school or home-based educational program to include in its curriculum any concept, topic or practice in conflict with its religious doctrines or to exclude from its curriculum any concept, topic or practice consistent with its religious doctrines.</p>

                  <p>(a) Every parent, guardian or other person having control or charge of any child who is a resident of this state and whose seventh birthday falls on or before September 15 of any year and who has not yet attained his sixteenth birthday or completed the tenth grade shall be required to send such child to, and such child shall be required to attend, a public or private school each year, during the entire time that the public schools shall be in session in the district in which the pupil resides; provided, that the board of trustees of each school district may exempt any child from the operation of this article when:</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 8/1/2021 this section will read as:</p>
                  <p>Every parent, guardian or other person having control or charge of any child who is a resident of this state and whose seventh birthday falls on or before August 1, or September 15 if the child started kindergarten pursuant to an approved request under W.S. 21-3-110(a)(xxxviii), of any year and who has not yet attained his sixteenth birthday or completed the tenth grade shall be required to send such child to, and such child shall be required to attend, a public or private school each year, during the entire time that the public schools shall be in session in the district in which the pupil resides; provided, that the board of trustees of each school district may exempt any child from the operation of this article when:</p>
                  <p>(i) The board believes that compulsory attendance in school would be detrimental to the mental or physical health of such child or the other children in the school; provided, the board may designate at the expense of the district a medical doctor of its choice to guide it and support it in its decision;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The board feels that compulsory school attendance might work undue hardship. The board may conduct a hearing on issues pursuant to this paragraph by executive session; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The child has been legally excluded from the regular schools pursuant to the provisions of W.S. 21-4-306.</p>
                  <p>(b) A home-based educational program shall meet the requirements of a basic academic educational program pursuant to W.S. 21-4-101(a)(vi). It shall be the responsibility of every person administering a home-based educational program to submit a curriculum to the local board of trustees each year showing that the program complies with the requirements of this subsection. Failure to submit a curriculum showing compliance is prima facie evidence that the home-based educational program does not meet the requirements of this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) In addition to subsection (a) of this section, the parent, guardian or other person having control or charge of any child under the age of eighteen (18), who has not otherwise notified the district of enrolling that child in a different school district or in a private school or home-based educational program, shall meet in person with a school district counselor or administrator to provide the school district with written consent to the withdrawal of that child from school attendance. The written consent to withdrawal shall include a separate provision authorizing the release of the student's identity and address to the Wyoming national guard youth challenge program, as established by W.S. 19-9-701, for the sole purpose of recruitment into the Wyoming national guard youth challenge program.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-4-305. Suspension or expulsion; authority; procedure.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The board of trustees of any school district is authorized to suspend or expel a student subject to the requirements to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard as set forth in this section. The board of trustees may delegate the authority to suspend or expel a student to disciplinarians chosen from the administrative and supervisory staff.</p>
                  <p>(b) No student shall be suspended or expelled from school without notice as set forth in this subsection and an opportunity to be heard as set forth in subsection (c) of this section. To provide notice the disciplinarian shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Give the student to be suspended or expelled oral or written notice of the charges against him and an explanation of the evidence the authorities have;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In good faith attempt to notify the student's parents, guardians or custodians within twenty-four (24) hours of the student's suspension or expulsion and the reasons for the suspension or expulsion, using contact information on record with the school or district. The disciplinarian shall keep record of the efforts to provide notice under this paragraph and whether the notice was provided successfully;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Give the student to be suspended or expelled an opportunity to be heard and to present his version of the charges against him as set forth in subsection (c) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(c) To provide an opportunity to be heard the disciplinarian shall give every student to be suspended or expelled the opportunity to be heard as soon as practicable after the misconduct, and in accordance with the following, unless a student requests an extension of time and the board of trustees or the disciplinarian designee of the board approves the extension:</p>
                  <p>(i) For a suspension of ten (10) school days or less, notice shall be provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(ii) of this section and a student shall be provided an opportunity to be heard before a student is removed unless the student's presence endangers persons or property or threatens disruption of the academic process, in which case his immediate removal from school may be justified, but the opportunity to be heard shall follow as soon as practicable, and not later than seventy- two (72) hours after his removal, not counting Saturdays and Sundays;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For a suspension or expulsion longer than ten (10) school days a hearing shall be held in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and, unless the student requests an extension and the board or the disciplinarian designee of the board approves an extension, the hearing shall be held within ten (10) business days, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, after the supervisory staff disciplinarian recommends suspension or expulsion to the appropriate administrator. The student's suspension shall continue until the hearing is held.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed by Laws 2019, ch. 164, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(e) Suspension or expulsion shall not be imposed as an additional punishment for offenses punishable under the laws of the state, except for expulsion by a district superintendent under subsection (a) of this section, or where the offense was committed at a school function, against the property of the school, or is of such nature that continuation of the child in school would clearly be detrimental to the education, welfare, safety or morals of other pupils. No suspension or expulsion shall be for longer than one (1) year.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any decision of the board, or of a designated superintendent, shall be considered a final decision which may be appealed to the district court of the county in which the school district is located, pursuant to provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The court may, on application or on its own motion, stay the decision of the board or superintendent pending appeal, considering both the best interests of the child and the need to maintain an orderly environment conducive to learning for other children.</p>
                  <p>(g) As used in this chapter, an "opportunity to be heard" means at a minimum a meeting in which the disciplinarian or his designee provides the substantive information regarding the suspension or expulsion to the student to be suspended, and the student to be suspended may dispute the substantive information provided. An opportunity to be heard does not require a formal hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act except as provided in paragraph (c)(ii) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Willful destruction or defacing of school property during the school year or any recess or vacation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any behavior which in the judgment of the local board of trustees is clearly detrimental to the education, welfare, safety or morals of other pupils, including the use of foul, profane or abusive language or habitually disruptive behavior as defined by subsection (b) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Torturing, tormenting, or abusing a pupil or in any way maltreating a pupil or a teacher with physical violence;</p>

                  <p>(b) As used in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section, "habitually disruptive behavior" means overt behavior willfully initiated by a student causing disruption in the classroom, on school grounds, on school vehicles or at school activities or events, which requires the attention of a teacher or other school personnel.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board of trustees shall, subject to the case-by- case modification permitted by subsection (d) of this section, require the district superintendent to expel from school for a period of one (1) year any student determined to violate paragraph (a)(v) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) The superintendent with the approval of the board of trustees may modify the period of any expulsion on a case-by- case basis based upon the circumstances of the violation. Upon a violation of paragraph (a)(v) of this section and following notice and hearing requirements of W.S. 21-4-305, the superintendent shall notify the district attorney of the violation together with the specific act in violation of paragraph (a)(v) of this section and the name of the student violating paragraph (a)(v) of this section. Nothing in this section prohibits a district from providing educational services to the expelled student in an alternative setting.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person attending, full or part time, any public or private school, kindergarten through twelfth grade, shall within thirty (30) days after the date of school entry, provide to the appropriate school official written documentary proof of immunization. For purposes of this section, documentary proof of immunization is written certification by a private licensed physician or his representative or by any public health authority, that the person is fully immunized. Documentation shall include month, day and year of each required immunization received against vaccine preventable disease as designated by the state health authority. No school administrator shall permit a student to attend school for more than thirty (30) calendar days without documentary proof of immunization. If immunization requires a series of immunizations over a period of more than thirty (30) calendar days, the child shall be permitted to attend school while receiving continuing immunization if the school administrator receives written notification by a private licensed physician or his representative or by a public health official, specifying a written schedule for necessary immunization completion within the medically accepted time period. Waivers shall be authorized by the state or county health officer upon submission of written evidence of religious objection or medical contraindication to the administration of any vaccine. In the presence of an outbreak of vaccine preventable disease as determined by the state or county health authority, school children for whom a waiver has been issued and who are not immunized against the occurring vaccine preventable disease shall be excluded from school attendance for a period of time determined by the state or county health authority, but not suspended from school as provided in W.S. 21-4-305. Children excluded from school attendance under this section shall not be counted in the aggregate number of pupils absent as defined in W.S. 21-13-101(a)(i).</p>
                  <p>(b) The school administrator shall be responsible for an audit of the immunization status of any child enrolled in the school in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the department of health.</p>
                  <p>(c) The written documented proof of immunization on a form provided by the state health officer shall be an integral part of the child's school record.</p>
                  <p>(d) For purposes of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "State health officer" means the person appointed by the director of the department of health pursuant to W.S. 9-2-103;</p>

                  <p>(iii) "Immunized" or "immunization" means initial immunization and any boosters or reimmunizations required to maintain immunization pursuant to the immunization standards and recommendations issued by the state health officer.</p>

                  <p>(a) A district board may adopt and implement a policy whereby the district may acquire, maintain and dispense to schools within the district a supply of epinephrine auto- injectors. Upon authorization by the board, school nurses and assigned school personnel may administer a stock epinephrine auto-injector to a student that the school nurse or assigned school personnel in good faith believes is experiencing a severe allergic reaction. A district board shall not be required to obtain a prescription to acquire, maintain or dispense to schools within the district a supply of epinephrine auto- injectors under this section. A district board may enter into arrangements with manufacturers or third-party suppliers of epinephrine auto-injectors to obtain the epinephrine auto- injectors at fair market, free or reduced prices.</p>
                  <p>(b) A district board that decides to acquire, maintain and dispense a supply of epinephrine auto-injectors shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Implement a plan based on the guidelines developed pursuant to this section for the management of students with life threatening allergies enrolled in the schools within the district;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Make the plan available on the school district's website or the website of each school within the district, or if such websites do not exist, make the plan publicly available through other practicable means as determined by the board.</p>
                  <p>(c) Not later than December 31, 2014, the department of education, in consultation with the department of health, shall develop and make available to all schools guidelines for the management of students with life threatening allergies. The guidelines shall include, but not be limited to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Identification of life threatening allergies or severe allergic reactions qualifying for administration of epinephrine auto-injectors under this act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Identification of appropriate and acceptable epinephrine auto-injectors;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Education and training for school personnel on the management of students with life threatening allergies, including training related to the administration of epinephrine auto-injectors;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Procedures for responding to life threatening allergies;</p>
                  <p>(v) A process for the development of individualized health care and allergy action plans for every student with a life threatening allergy;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Protocols to prevent exposure to allergens;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Requirements for each school to keep a record of each incident that involves a life threatening allergy or the administration of stock epinephrine auto-injectors;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Requirements for schools that have adopted a policy allowing for the administration of stock epinephrine auto-injectors pursuant to this section to maintain a list of employees in the school or school district who have been trained and assigned to administer stock epinephrine auto-injectors;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Requirements for school nurses and assigned school personnel to confirm completion of a training program approved by the department of education, in consultation with the department of health.</p>
                  <p>(d) A school that possesses and makes available stock epinephrine auto-injectors and those persons specified in this subsection shall not be liable for damages for any injuries that result from the administration of, self-administration of, or failure to administer epinephrine auto-injectors that may constitute ordinary negligence. This immunity applies regardless of whether authorization was provided by the student's parent or guardian or by the student's health care provider. This immunity does not apply to acts or omissions constituting gross, willful or wanton negligence. The administration of stock epinephrine auto-injectors in accordance with this section is not the practice of medicine. The immunity from liability provided under this section is in addition to and not in lieu of that provided under W.S. 1-1-120. The immunity provided in this subsection extends to:</p>
                  <p>(i) A district board, school nurses, employees, agents and volunteers of the district;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An authorized health care provider who prescribes stock epinephrine auto-injectors; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) An individual or entity that conducts the training described in this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Administer" or "administration" means the direct application of a stock epinephrine auto-injector;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Assigned school personnel" means an employee, agent or volunteer of a school designated by the administrator of the school who has completed the training required under this section to provide or administer stock epinephrine auto- injectors;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Authorized health care provider" means an individual authorized by law to prescribe and administer prescription drugs in the course of professional practice;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Provide" means the supply of one (1) or more stock epinephrine auto-injectors;</p>
                  <p>(v) "Stock epinephrine" means injectable medications used for the treatment of severe, life-threatening allergies that schools or districts buy and keep on-site for emergency use.</p>
                  <p>(f) Nothing in this section shall be held to apply to or affect W.S. 21-4-310.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-4-401. Transportation or maintenance for isolated pupils.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The board of trustees of any school district within the state shall provide transportation or maintenance for isolated elementary, middle, junior high or high school pupils resident within the district, whenever it would be in the best interests of the affected children to provide transportation or maintenance than to establish a school to serve these pupils, and for those isolated pupils resident within the district who are attending a school in another district pursuant to W.S. 21-4-502. Amounts paid under this section shall be subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section and shall not exceed the actual costs incurred by parents or pupils.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state superintendent shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations pertaining to residence requirements establishing eligibility under this section and for provision of tuition and transportation or maintenance. No person is eligible as an isolated pupil under this section unless the pupil's parents or legal guardians demonstrate to the local school board that the family's residing in the isolated location is necessary for the family's financial well being. The burden shall be on the parent or guardian to demonstrate that the family's residing in the isolated location is necessary for the family's financial well being. The final decision as to eligibility shall be made by the district board of trustees.</p>
                  <p>(c) The rights accorded under this section shall be enforceable by writ of mandamus, and in such event the district shall pay all costs and legal expenses of a petitioner successful in obtaining such writ.</p>
                  <p>(d) To receive transportation payments under this section, the parent or legal guardian of any isolated pupil eligible under this section shall file a transportation reimbursement claim with the district on a form provided by the district specifying the total round trip miles traveled each day to and from the bus stop or the school, as applicable. The total round trip miles shall be multiplied by the applicable mileage rate prescribed under W.S. 9-3-103(a)(iii) to compute the daily mileage reimbursement amount. Where combined transportation is provided for two (2) or more isolated pupils being transported to the same school, only one (1) reimbursement shall be made. Payments to parents or guardians for transporting students to and from school shall be computed excluding the first two (2) miles traveled each way. No payments shall be paid to a parent or guardian for transportation of students unless the pupil resides in an isolated location as specified under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) Monthly maintenance payments may be paid under this section in lieu of transportation payments if the pupil resides at a location near the school rather than the isolated location. The amount paid shall be the lesser of the amount of maintenance payments claimed or the transportation payments that would have been payable under subsection (d) of this section. Monthly maintenance payments under this section shall reimburse the isolated student's parent or legal guardian for additional reasonable living expenses for only those months school is in session. A district shall be reimbursed for the full amount of isolation or maintenance payments it makes under this section. Reimbursement shall be made as if the district's total foundation program amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309(p) was increased by the amount of isolation or maintenance payments made during the preceding year.</p>

                  <p>(b) The board shall also offer homebound instruction for each pupil in the district who is hospitalized or placed in a state accredited or state certified treatment facility for more than one (1) week in a hospital or facility located in another Wyoming school district because of injury or illness.

Payment of tuition for children resident in districts which maintain no high school; admission of children to high schools in other districts; state board approval for out-of-state placements; duties of admitting districts; tuition amount.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any district which does not maintain a high school shall pay tuition, in addition to transportation or maintenance, for any child resident therein who has successfully completed the course offered therein and desires to attend high school, at any public school within or subject to the approval of the state board of education, without the state, which the district board may designate in the best interest, welfare and convenience of the child. Application for attendance at a high school outside the state shall be filed by the nonunified district board with the state department of education. If the nonunified district provides evidence that the amount of tuition assessed by the out-of-state district for the out-of-state placement shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the actual per pupil cost as determined under subsection (c) of this section, state board approval shall be waived under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board of trustees of any school district within the state which maintains a high school shall admit, upon payment of tuition, pupils of districts which do not maintain a high school; provided that nothing in this section shall be construed to require a district to admit nonresident pupils, when to do so would overcrowd the facilities of the admitting district or in any way work a definite hardship upon the educational program offered by the admitting district. The admitting district shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Include any pupil admitted under this section among its average daily membership (ADM) for purposes of computing the foundation program under W.S. 21-13-309; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Account separately for the portion of the tuition received pursuant to this section which is related to school buildings and facilities, as determined by the district and reported to the state department, and deposit that portion in its debt service account. The remainder shall be reported as revenues for purposes of W.S. 21-13-310(a)(ix).</p>
                  <p>(c) The amount of tuition assessed under this section shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost of the district for the previous year, plus the cost of bond redemption and interest for the previous year, by the total of the district's average daily membership for the previous year.</p>
                  <p>(d) Subject to state board approval if an out-of-state placement as required under subsection (a) of this section, nonunified school districts shall be reimbursed from the school foundation program account for tuition paid under subsection (a) of this section as if the district's total foundation program amount for that year as computed under W.S. 21-13-309(p) was increased by the amount of the tuition paid during the preceding year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any out-of-state placement under subsection (a) of this section shall include within the agreement with the out-of- state school district, that district's agreement to provide student transcripts as required under W.S. 21-16-1308(a)(ii). The agreement shall also require the out-of-state school district to cooperate with the department of education to identify those courses provided by the out-of-state school district which satisfy the success curriculum requirements established under W.S. 21-16-1307.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board of trustees of every school district within the state may provide for the enrollment of any pupil resident therein in a school within another district if the pupil desires to attend the school and if attendance in such other district would be more convenient or is desirable because of services available in the other district. Except as provided under subsection (c) of this section, the district providing for the enrollment of the pupil in a school within another district shall not include the pupil within its average daily membership (ADM) for purposes of the foundation program under W.S. 21-13-309.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any district within the state may admit pupils resident in other districts of the state unless the admission overcrowds the classrooms of the admitting district. No district within the state shall be required to admit a pupil who has been suspended or expelled by the board of trustees or designated disciplinarian of any other district located in or outside the state. Except as provided under subsection (c) of this section, the district admitting a pupil under this subsection shall not assess tuition payments upon the district wherein the pupil resides, but shall include the pupil within its average daily membership (ADM) for purposes of determining its foundation program amount under W.S. 21-13-309.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any district within the state may allow pupils enrolled in another school district in the state to receive a portion of a pupil's education pursuant to an agreement with the district in which the pupil is enrolled. The agreement shall be in writing with a copy kept on file by both districts. The district providing for the enrollment of the pupil shall include the pupil within its average daily membership (ADM) for purposes of the foundation program under W.S. 21-13-309. The district providing a portion of the pupil’s education may assess the district providing for the enrollment of the pupil tuition for the classes the pupil attends. The tuition shall be equal to or less than the per ADM amount for the district providing a portion of the pupil’s education prorated to reflect the number of classes attended by the pupil.</p>

                  <p>A school district admitting a pupil from a nonunified school district in the state under W.S. 21-4-501 or providing for the enrollment of a pupil in a school within a school district in another state under W.S. 21-4-505 shall, in accordance with rules and regulations of the state department, be reimbursed from the school foundation program account for expenditures for maintaining that pupil in the admitting district for any length of time the pupil is required to reside in the admitting district. Reimbursement under this subsection shall be subject to and reported in accordance with rule and regulation of the state department and shall be administered as if the district's total foundation program amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309(p) is increased by the amount of the expenditure for maintenance during the preceding year for a school district admitting a pupil from a nonunified school district in the state under W.S. 21-4-501 and in the current school year for pupils attending a school in another state under W.S. 21-4-505.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever it shall appear to the board of trustees of any school district within the state that instruction for any pupil residing in the district can be more advantageously or economically furnished by a public school maintained by another state, the board of trustees of such Wyoming district may enter into an agreement for the instruction of such pupils at rates of tuition specified in the agreement. The Wyoming district shall be reimbursed for the full amount of tuition assessed by the out of state district during the current school year subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Effective school year 2017-2018 and each year thereafter, the Wyoming school district shall submit a report to the department of education in the manner and form and at times specified by department rule and regulation, documenting the number of pupils attending a public school maintained by another state and verifying payments to such districts for educational services;</p>
                  <p>(ii) From amounts appropriated by the legislature from the public school foundation program account for purposes of this subsection, the department of education shall distribute payments to eligible districts in accordance with this subsection on or before May 15 of the applicable school year, together with the district's foundation payment under W.S. 21-13-313(c), if applicable;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The district shall not include a pupil attending a school within an out of state school district within its average daily membership (ADM) for purposes of computing its foundation program amount under W.S. 21-13-309.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any school district within the state may enter into agreements to admit pupils from out of state at the rate of tuition at least as high as the actual per pupil cost of the Wyoming district computed as provided in W.S. 21-4-501(c). The admitting district shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) If it requires payment of tuition at least as high as provided under W.S. 21-4-501(c), include the admitted out of state pupil within its average daily membership (ADM) for purposes of computing its foundation program amount under W.S. 21-13-309; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Account separately for the portion of the tuition received pursuant to this subsection which is related to school buildings and facilities, as determined by the district and reported to the state department, and deposit that portion in its debt service account. The remainder shall be reported as revenues for purposes of W.S. 21-13-310(a)(ix).</p>
                  <p>(c) Any out-of-state placement under subsection (a) of this section shall include within the agreement with the out-of- state school district, that district's agreement to provide student transcripts as required under W.S. 21-16-1308(a)(ii). The agreement shall also require the out-of-state school district to cooperate with the department of education to identify those courses provided by the out-of-state school district which satisfy the success curriculum requirements established under W.S. 21-16-1307.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-4-601. Education programs on the Wind River Indian Reservation.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The legislature finds that, through education programs provided by the Eastern Shoshone and the Northern Arapaho Indian Tribes to school age Indian children residing on the Wind River Indian Reservation, the state can address conditions of unemployment, poverty and lack of adequate job skills which exist on the reservation. Maintenance of these education programs unique to Indian students is of mutual benefit to the tribes and the state, reducing future financial needs of those students as tribal members and as Wyoming residents for public education, job services, substance abuse services and income supplements.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to amounts appropriated by the legislature, the state superintendent of public instruction shall enter into negotiations with the individual or joint business councils of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Indian Tribes to determine the appropriate contractual arrangements for the provision of education programs and services addressing Indian students at risk of failure in school and other programs and services essential to the success and welfare of these students as specified under subsection (a) of this section. Contractual arrangements entered into under this subsection shall include a requirement that the expenditure of contractual amounts, as verified annually in writing, is for programs tied to improvement of student performance on the statewide assessment. For purposes of this section, the state superintendent shall include an amount within his biennial budget request which is computed in accordance with subsection (c) of this section to provide a per student amount that when nonstate funding sources are considered, is comparable to per student amounts provided for public schools under the Wyoming education resource block grant model.</p>
                  <p>(c) To arrive at a biennial funding amount for purposes of subsection (b) of this section, an estimate shall be computed as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Determine a combined average per student funding level under the Wyoming education resource block grant model for Fremont County school districts number fourteen (14), number twenty-one (21) and number thirty-eight (38);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Multiply the per student amount determined under paragraph (i) of this subsection by the number of students enrolled in education programs and services provided by the joint business council pursuant to subsection (a) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Subtract from the amount computed under paragraph (ii) of this subsection all Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs funds for K-12 programs received by the joint business council for education programs and services provided under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) The joint business council of the Eastern Shoshone and the Northern Arapaho Indian Tribes shall annually report to the governor and the state superintendent of public instruction on the expenditure of contractual amounts as required under subsection (b) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(b) The department shall, in consultation with tribes of the region including the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Indian tribes, make available materials and resources on the department's official web site to assist school districts in meeting social studies benchmarks within Wyoming social studies content and performance standards relating to the study of American Indian tribes.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-6-215. Appointment and terms of trustees for new districts.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Whenever a new district is created under the provisions of this article, the district boundary board shall appoint a board of trustees for the new district from the combined membership of all the original boards of trustees of the districts involved based upon at-large appointments or through established trustee residence areas in accordance with W.S. 21-3-111(b)(ii). The district boundary board shall make provision for staggering terms so that a proportion of the membership, as nearly equal as possible, will be elected every two (2) years in the manner provided for the regular election of school board members. The appointed board shall consist of five (5), seven (7) or nine (9) members, who shall serve for not less than two (2) years following the effective date of the plan and until December 1 following the first or second regularly scheduled school election following the effective date of the plan. Thereafter, all trustees shall be elected for four (4) year terms, except those who may fill unexpired terms.</p>
                  <p>(b) All trustees shall be elected by the electorate of the entire school district. According to the approved proposal and except those districts for which membership is based upon at- large appointments pursuant to W.S. 21-3-111(b)(i), each trustee residence area shall be entitled to one (1) or more representatives on the board and the candidate nominated from each trustee residence area receiving the largest number of votes shall be elected. If a member of the board of trustees shall become a nonresident of the district or the trustee residence area from which elected during his term of office, as applicable, he shall be deemed thereby to vacate his office. Any vacancy which for any reason occurs on the board shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members by the appointment of a resident of the district or the trustee residence area in which the vacancy occurs, as appropriate, and the appointee shall hold his office until the next annual election, at which a trustee shall be duly elected and qualified for the remainder of the unexpired term.</p>

                  <p>(a) On the effective date of the proposal, each proposed newly organized school district shall be and become a body corporate under the name and number as indicated in the proposal as a school district, and the new board of trustees shall have full authority and power to act as the board of trustees to do all things necessary with reference to the business and educational affairs of the new school district using the funds on hand or the funds received through existing levies of the old districts as nearly as practicable for the balance of the fiscal year.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever the district boundary board establishes a new district from districts already organized, the board of trustees of the newly organized district may draw its proportion of the public school funds for paying teachers or other legal school expenses from the school treasury of the district or districts from which it was separated until such time as the newly organized district receives its proper apportionment of school monies and taxes.

However, real property which was transferred in accordance with this subsection from a then existing school district to a newly organized school district and on which is located a structure used as a school which the district has closed or intends to close shall not be conveyed or offered for sale to any other entity unless the municipality in which the property is located is first offered a right to purchase the property. If the municipality and school board cannot agree on a price for the property, the property shall be sold to the highest bidder at a public auction.</p>

                  <p>(a) For the support of the public elementary and secondary schools of the state, there shall be assessed and levied each year a state tax of twelve (12) mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of the property within the state as certified on August 10 under W.S. 39-11-102.1(c)(v) except as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The tax is in addition to any and all other taxes authorized by law.</p>
                  <p>(b) The funds that may accrue under this section shall be placed in a separate account. Balances in the account, if any, shall not lapse or be transferred to any other fund or account.</p>
                  <p>(c) Between July 1 and July 10 of each year the state auditor and the state treasurer shall determine if the unobligated average daily general fund balance over the preceding fiscal year exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the amount of the general fund appropriations for the present biennium. If the unobligated average daily general fund balance exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the amount appropriated, the excess is appropriated and shall be transferred into the foundation program account as soon as possible. The auditor and treasurer shall immediately notify the state board of equalization of the amount to be transferred. Based on the current assessed valuation of the state, the board shall compute the estimated amount of revenue to be produced by a twelve (12) mill levy, subtract the amount transferred to the foundation program account and then compute the mill levy necessary to produce the difference. The board shall certify the recomputed mill levy to the county assessors to be levied and collected in lieu of the twelve (12) mill state levy for the next tax year.</p>

                  <p>(a) The amount of money which shall be distributed to each district from the foundation account shall be determined by subtracting the sum of the district revenues computed in accordance with W.S. 21-13-310 from the total amount of the foundation program computed in accordance with W.S. 21-13-309.</p>

                  <p>(a) To preserve the integrity of the foundation account for the biennium and so that payments can be made during the full school year for each year of the biennium, if it appears to the state superintendent that the income available to the foundation program account is not sufficient to meet the payments as provided by law:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state superintendent shall determine a uniform percentage by which the amount guaranteed to each district under W.S. 21-13-309 shall be reduced so that available revenues in the foundation program account for that school year are as nearly as possible equal to the amount necessary to fund payments to districts under W.S. 21-13-313; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The revenue to be rebated by a district under W.S. 21-13-102(b) shall be adjusted based upon the guaranteed amount for that district determined under paragraph (a)(i) of this section.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-13-313. Distribution of funds from foundation account; property tax and cash reserve adjustment; regulations.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) For each school year the state auditor, on the certification of the state superintendent, shall draw warrants on the state treasurer for the amount of money which shall be distributed to each district from the foundation account as computed under W.S. 21-13-311. The warrants, payable to the treasurer of the district concerned, shall be delivered to the state superintendent for distribution to the several school districts.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state superintendent shall determine on or before August 15 of each year the tentative allotment of foundation funds to which each district is entitled under this article. In making this determination, the state superintendent may, if current fiscal information required by law to compute the tentative allotment is not available for any district by August 1 of that year, use fiscal information available to the state superintendent from the foundation program computations of the previous school year for that district. The previous year's fiscal information shall be adjusted to reflect current fiscal changes and other information known by or available to the state superintendent. Upon receiving actual fiscal information from a district, the state superintendent shall accordingly adjust future foundation program determinations for that district such that foundation program payments appropriately reflect current fiscal information for the applicable school year.</p>
                  <p>(c) Fifteen percent (15%) of each district's entitlement shall be paid to the district on or before August 15 of each year and subject to any adjustment under subsections (d) and (e) of this section, ten percent (10%) of each district's entitlement shall be paid on or about the fifteenth day of each month through April of each year. The final payment for the balance of each district's entitlement shall be distributed on or before May 15 of each year. If, after March 1 and before April 1, the state superintendent determines that the entitlement to be paid to a district for that school year is not accurate, the state superintendent shall adjust payments to or payments from that district as necessary to correct the inaccuracy as soon as practicable. Except as provided under W.S. 21-2-202(e), after March 31 of any school year, the state superintendent shall not adjust any district's entitlement or fiscal information used to compute a district's entitlement for that school year, and the entitlement or fiscal information shall only be adjusted thereafter in accordance with audit review pursuant to W.S. 9-1-513.</p>
                  <p>(d) On or before August 15 of the succeeding fiscal year, each school district shall report the amount of revenue it received during the preceding fiscal year attributable to levies provided by W.S. 21-13-102(a)(i)(A) and (ii)(A) and 21-13-201 regardless of the assessment year, but not to include assessments from years prior to July 1, 1991. If those revenues reported are less than the revenues estimated under W.S. 21-13-310(a)(i) and (ii) for that fiscal year, as applicable, and if the district's total revenues computed under W.S. 21-13-310 for that fiscal year continue to be less than the total foundation program amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309, the school district shall be paid the difference by October 15 from the foundation program account. No amount in excess of the total foundation program amount computed for any district for that fiscal year shall be paid from the foundation program account for purposes of this subsection. Any amount paid under this subsection shall not thereafter be relevant to or used for future foundation program calculations. If those revenues reported are greater than the revenues estimated under W.S. 21-13-310(a)(i) and (ii) for that fiscal year, as applicable, the excess shall be included as revenues of the district under W.S. 21-13-310 in computing the foundation entitlement for the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Not later than January 31 of each fiscal year, the department shall compute the amount by which each district's operating balance and cash reserves at the end of the preceding fiscal year exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total foundation program amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309 for the preceding fiscal year. In making this calculation, the entire operating balance and cash reserves for each district for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, as computed by the department, shall be separately accounted for and excluded, until it has been completely expended by the district. Revenues from settlements of protested amounts attributable to levies assessed under W.S. 21-13-102(a)(i)(A) and (ii)(A) and 21-13-201, regardless of the assessment year, shall be accounted for and excluded from the calculation under this subsection for a period of not more than one (1) year following that fiscal year in which the revenue was received by a district, as verified in writing by the district and certified by the county treasurer. Except as otherwise provided in 1997 Special Session Laws, chapter 3, section 306(e), as amended, and except as excluded under this subsection, that excess shall be deemed to be a state revenue under W.S. 21-13-310(a) for the purpose of determining distributions under W.S. 21-13-311 and amounts to be rebated under W.S. 21-13-102. The department shall promulgate rules, including reporting requirements and procedures for districts, to implement this subsection. As used in this section, "operating balance and cash reserves" means those financial resources of the district which are not encumbered by the district board of trustees for expenditure to meet an existing legal obligation or otherwise restricted by law or regulation for expenditure on specific educational programs. For purposes of this subsection, any balance within a district's separate account established under W.S. 21-15-109(e) for major building and facility repair and replacement shall be deemed restricted by law for expenditure as provided by W.S. 21-15-109(e) and shall not be considered an operating balance and cash reserve under this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed By Laws 1998, ch. 2, § 803.</p>
                  <p>(g) In addition to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the state superintendent shall, for any district subject to W.S. 21-13-102(b) as determined by the department for any school year, or for any district not subject to W.S. 21-13-102(b) whose entitlement amount determined under W.S. 21-13-311(a) for any school year is equal to or less than twenty percent (20%) of the foundation program amount computed under W.S. 21-13-309(p), and upon demonstration by the district of financial need as documented by cash flow analysis, provide payments from the school foundation program account in an amount not to exceed one-fifth (1/5) of the foundation program amount computed for that district for that school year in accordance with W.S. 21-13-309. The computed amount shall be paid to each eligible district on or before September 1 based upon tentative computations under W.S. 21-13-309, for which the department may use fiscal information available from foundation program computations for the previous school year in the manner provided under subsection (b) of this section. Any district receiving a payment under this subsection shall repay the foundation program account not later than December 15 of that school year.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-13-315. Costs of court ordered placement of children in private residential treatment facilities, group homes, day treatment programs and juvenile detention facilities.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The department of family services shall establish an account to pay residential and treatment costs excluding educational and medical costs of court ordered placements of children in private residential treatment facilities and group homes located in Wyoming. Programs providing education services including programs for children with disabilities provided by a board of cooperative educational services, shall bill the department of education directly for educational costs of court ordered placements. In addition, costs of all services provided pursuant to a student's individualized education program, including special education services, related services and supplementary aids and services for children with disabilities and costs of education assessment for other children incurred as a result of court order prior to any placement, shall be billed directly to the department of education. The department of family services shall promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to provide procedures for implementing subsection</p>
                  <p>(m) of this section. If the court rejects an in-state placement recommendation of the predisposition report or multidisciplinary team under W.S. 14-6-227 or 14-6-427, the court shall enter on the record specific findings of fact relied upon to support its decision to deviate from the recommended disposition. No court shall order an out-of-state placement unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) Evidence has been presented to the court regarding the costs of the out-of-state placement being ordered together with evidence of the comparative costs of any suitable alternative in-state treatment program or facility, as determined by the department of family services pursuant to paragraph (d)(vii) of this section, whether or not placement in the in-state program or facility is currently available;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The court makes an affirmative finding on the record that no placement can be made in a Wyoming institution or in a private residential treatment facility or group home located in Wyoming that can provide adequate treatment or services for the child; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The court states on the record why no in-state placement is available.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except to the extent costs are covered under subsection (n) of this section, the department of education using federal or foundation funds, or both, shall pay for the allowable education costs of juvenile and district court ordered placements of children residing in private treatment facilities and group homes where a fee is charged, including court ordered placements in programs for children with disabilities provided by a board of cooperative educational services. No district shall receive funds, either directly or indirectly, from any facility or home receiving payment under this section for providing education programs and services to children placed and residing in the facility or home, but the district may count the children among its average daily membership if the district provides education services directly to the children or pays another district to provide education services to the children pursuant to contract. The department of education shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations prescribing standards and allowable costs for educational program services funded under this section. Standards shall be subject to W.S. 21-9-101 and 21-9-102 and rules and regulations of the state board and shall be designed to fit the unique populations of residential centers, group homes, programs and services provided by boards of cooperative educational services and out of state placement facilities.</p>
                  <p>(c) Costs shall be billed monthly by the program provider to:</p>
                  <p>(i) The department of family services account for residential and treatment services; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except to the extent costs are covered under subsection (n) of this section, the department of education for approved educational services specified under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a placement of a child is to be made and funded under this section, the predisposition study required by W.S. 14-6-227 or 14-6-427 shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A description of efforts to provide services to the child in the home prior to placement;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Contact with other agencies involved with the child. At a minimum, those contacted shall include the child's school and the field office of the department of family services;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The presence of any preexisting and identified handicapping conditions;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A review of the financial resources of the child's parent or guardian;</p>
                  <p>(v) A certification by the department of family services that funding for the placement is available within the appropriation. The placement of the child shall not be funded under this section if the department of family services is unable to make the certification. The department of family services shall make the certification only if unencumbered funds are available within the appropriation making allowance for the costs for children already placed. Funds shall not be certified available if an adequate, less restrictive, less expensive placement is available;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The names of persons and agencies contacted in preparing the report; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) If an out-of-state placement is under consideration, the name, address, program description and costs of each Wyoming institution and each private residential treatment facility and group home located in Wyoming that the department of family services has determined can provide adequate treatment or services for the child, and whether placement in the in-state institution, treatment facility or group home is available.</p>
                  <p>(e) If at any time the placement is found to be educationally inappropriate or not the least restrictive placement available, the placement shall be referred back to the court with a recommendation on what would be a suitable placement.</p>
                  <p>(f) Only group homes and residential treatment facilities certified by the department of family services are eligible to receive funding for residential and treatment services under this section. Costs for education services shall be paid by the department of education under this section only if the educational program of the group home or residential treatment facility or the program provided by the board of cooperative educational services meets the standards of subsection (b) of this section and has been approved by the department. The department of family services and the department of education shall provide the courts with a list of approved facilities and services. The court shall determine the parents' or the guardian's contribution to the court ordered placement for all costs excluding necessary education costs based on the parents' or guardian's ability to pay as provided by W.S. 14-6-236 or 14-6-435.</p>
                  <p>(g) Repealed by Laws 1987, ch. 221, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(h) In the placement order the court shall declare the child's school district or school districts of residency in any district or districts which it deems proper in the best interests of the child. The declaration by the court shall be binding upon the school districts.</p>
                  <p>(j) In the placement order the court shall determine that adequate efforts were made to maintain the child in the child's home prior to placement.</p>
                  <p>(k) Except as otherwise provided by law, this section applies to children who are at least five (5) years of age as of September 15 of the applicable school year but who are under twenty-one (21) years of age.</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 8/1/2021 this section will read as:</p>
                  <p>Except as otherwise provided by law, this section applies to children who are at least five (5) years of age as of August 1, or September 15 if pursuant to an approved request under W.S. 21-3-110(a)(xxxviii), of the year in which they may register in kindergarten as provided in W.S. 21-4-302(b) but who are under twenty-one (21) years of age.</p>
                  <p>(m) The department of family services shall regularly monitor the amount of unencumbered funds available within the appropriation making allowance for the costs for children already placed. If the projected costs exceed the amount available, the division shall terminate its contracts for services under this section after notice of thirty (30) days and reduce the rates it pays to all providers by a uniform percentage. The percentage shall be determined by the division and shall bring the costs and projected fund availability into balance. The division shall readjust rates dependent upon change in availability of funds.</p>
                  <p>(n) Prior to billing the department of education under paragraph (c)(ii) of this section, program providers shall bill the department of health for costs of approved educational services covered under the school health program under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act pursuant to W.S. 42-4-103(a)(xxx).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-13-336. Education costs of children certified by the department of health for treatment in psychiatric residential treatment facilities.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The department of education using federal or school foundation program account funds as appropriated by the legislature, or both, shall pay for the allowable education costs of children placed in psychiatric residential treatment facilities where a fee is charged and the department of health has determined the placement is medically necessary for purposes of benefit eligibility under W.S. 42-4-103(a)(xvi). This section shall not apply to children eligible for services under W.S. 21-13-315. No district shall receive funds, either directly or indirectly, from any facility receiving payment under this section for providing educational programs and services to children placed and residing in the facility. No psychiatric residential treatment facility shall receive funds for educational services under this section unless certified by the department of health for purposes of providing medical services and approved by the department of education under the requirements of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon placement or admittance of a child in a psychiatric residential treatment facility, the facility shall notify the department of education and the student's resident school district in writing within seventy-two (72) hours of placement. Within seven (7) days of receiving notice, the resident school district shall notify the facility of the manner in which educational services shall be provided to the child. The district shall either:</p>
                  <p>(i) Request the facility provide the educational services to the student;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Deliver the educational services directly to the student; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Contract with the school district in which the psychiatric residential treatment facility is located to provide educational services to the student.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a psychiatric residential treatment facility does not receive notification from the school district regarding educational services for the student as required by subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section, the facility shall provide educational services to the student provided the facility has an education program certified by the department of education pursuant to department rules and regulations.</p>
                  <p>(d) A district that provides educational services directly to the student, or contracts with another district to provide the educational services, shall continue to count the student among its ADM. A district shall eliminate students from its ADM if the psychiatric residential treatment facility provides the educational services pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) Educational programs provided by psychiatric residential treatment facilities shall be certified and approved by the department of education prior to the facility billing the department for any educational services provided under this section. A facility providing educational services under this section shall bill the department of education monthly for allowable education costs as defined by department rule and regulation pursuant to W.S. 21-13-315(b).</p>
                  <p>(f) If at any time the department of health determines the placement is no longer medically necessary for purposes of receiving benefits under W.S. 42-4-103(a)(xvi), the department of education shall discontinue payment for educational services provided by a psychiatric residential treatment facility.</p>
                  <p>(g) All psychiatric residential treatment facilities providing educational services shall comply with the provisions of the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. Not later than ten (10) days after release of the student from the psychiatric residential treatment facility, all educational records shall be transferred via a secure method to the resident school district or the district in which the student enrolls upon release.</p>
                  <p>(h) A school district or psychiatric residential treatment facility providing educational services to a student placed in a treatment facility shall create an individualized learning plan for the student, which:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is appropriate for the learning capabilities of the student and complies with all state and federal education requirements;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Monitors and measures the student's progress towards meeting defined educational benchmarks and accounts for any applicable assessment requirements;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Facilitates necessary instructional support for the student and notifies and assists the student if he is not performing satisfactorily or failing to achieve performance benchmarks established within the individualized learning plan;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Maintains the student's permanent education records, including his individualized learning plan, equivalent attendance as specified by the plan, assessment and other performance evaluation data, immunization and other information required by the state; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Verifies the individualized learning plan complies with and fulfills the state education program established by W.S. 21-9-101 and 21-9-102 and rules and regulations of the state board and that the plan otherwise meets educational program standards.</p>
                  <p>(j) The department of education shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations necessary for carrying out its duties under this section, including prescribing standards for educational programs of psychiatric residential treatment facilities and a certification and approval process for educational programs of facilities. Standards shall be subject to W.S. 21-9-101 and 21-9-102 and rules and regulations of the state board and shall be designed to fit the unique populations of students placed in psychiatric residential treatment facilities under this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) For purposes of this section "resident school district" means the district in which the child's custodial parent or guardian resides at the time of the child's placement in the psychiatric residential treatment facility.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-13-701. Submission of question to electors authorized; purposes for which indebtedness may be created; required public hearing on bonding proposition; reserve fund for maintenance required.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The board of trustees of a school district may, after conducting at least two (2) public hearings as required under subsection (c) of this section and subject to subsection (d) of this section, submit to the qualified electors of the district on a date authorized under W.S. 22-21-103, the question of creating an indebtedness for the purpose of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Acquiring or improving land;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Acquiring or erecting buildings;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Enlarging, improving, remodeling, repairing or adding to buildings;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Equipping and furnishing buildings;</p>
                  <p>(v) Repair and maintenance; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any combination of the above.</p>
                  <p>(b) The purposes for which an indebtedness may be created shall be broadly construed. It is the intention of the legislature that school districts be empowered to create indebtedness under this section for any purpose which, directly or indirectly, enables the district to provide facilities which are in excess of the statewide standards for the adequacy of school buildings and facilities.</p>
                  <p>(c) Prior to submitting a bonding proposition to district voters in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the school district board of trustees shall hold at least two (2) public hearings within the district at which the board provides an explanation of the need to obtain district funding for building and facility features that are in excess of state standards for buildings and facilities.</p>
                  <p>(d) In addition to subsection (a) of this section and for any bond proposition submitted to district voters on or after July 1, 2007, the proposition shall provide that not less than three percent (3%) of bond proceeds be used for the creation of reserves or sinking funds for the maintenance and repair of any buildings or facilities or any building or facility features in excess of state building and facility adequacy standards which are to be constructed or otherwise acquired through the bond issue.</p>

                  <p>Each school district actually and physically operating within its boundaries a school shall have a limit on outstanding indebtedness of ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of the taxable property therein. Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting any combination of school districts embracing common territory to incur a bonded indebtedness of more than ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of the taxable property therein. The amount in any sinking fund available for the payment of outstanding indebtedness may be deducted for the purpose of computing the debt-incurring power of such district. For this purpose, any general assessment for a particular district shall become effective when the county assessor shall have received notice from the state board of equalization of its final approval of the county valuations; provided, however, that if the county assessor receives such notice after the district has entered into an enforceable contract for the sale of bonds, a new lower assessed valuation shall not become effective until the day following the date of delivery of such bonds.</p>

All costs and expenses incident to the issue and sale of the bonds may be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds. If the bonds are to be sold at public sale, the school district board of trustees shall give notice of sale by at least one (1) insertion of such notice in some newspaper of general circulation in the district of its intention to sell the bonds. The notice shall briefly describe the bonds and the time and place where the sale thereof will take place. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the district, the board may publish the notice of sale in any newspaper published in the county seat of any county in which the district is wholly or partially located. Publication shall be made not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date designated for the sale of the bonds.</p>

                  <p>(b) A bond delivered to the purchaser thereof in the optional statutory form shall:</p>

                <p>(a) Before distribution to the school lands mineral royalties account under W.S. 9-4-305(b), sufficient revenues for the purposes of this section shall be deducted therefrom and credited to a bond repayment account pursuant to the terms of the resolution, indenture or other appropriate proceeding authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds under this section. The revenues deducted shall be used as provided by this section. The balance of the revenues shall be credited to the school lands mineral royalties account as provided under W.S. 9-4- 305(b). After available revenues under W.S. 9-4-305(b) have been used, revenues under W.S. 21-13-301 shall also be credited, as necessary, to the bond repayment account and shall be used as provided by this section.</p>
                <p>(b) The school facilities commission may borrow money in a principal amount not to exceed one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00) by the issuance from time to time of one (1) or more series of revenue bonds. The commission may encumber revenues under subsection (a) of this section for bonds in total amounts not to exceed one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00) issued for school capital construction projects and assistance as determined by the commission and approved by the legislature under W.S. 21-15-119. Any bonds issued under this section, together with any interest accruing thereon and any prior redemption premiums due in connection therewith, are payable and collectible solely out of revenues authorized under this section. The bondholders may not look to any general or other fund for payment of the bonds except the revenues pledged therefore. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness or a debt within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision or limitation. The bonds shall not be considered or held to be general obligations of the state but shall constitute its special obligations and the commission shall not pledge the state's full faith and credit for payment of the bonds.</p>
                <p>(c) Bonds issued under this section shall be in a form, issued in a manner, at, above or below par at a discount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the principal amount of the bonds, at public or private sale, and issued with recitals, terms, covenants, conditions and other provisions not contrary to other applicable statutes, as may be provided by the commission in a resolution authorizing their issuance and in an indenture or other appropriate proceedings.</p>
                <p>(d) Any bonds issued under this section shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Be of denominations of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or multiples thereof;</p>
                <p>(ii) Be fully negotiable within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, W.S. 34.1-1-101 through 34.1-10-104;</p>
                <p>(iii) Mature at a time or serially at times in regular numerical order at annual or other designated intervals in amounts designated and fixed by the commission, but not exceeding thirty (30) years from their date;</p>
                <p>(iv) Bear interest payable annually, semiannually or at other designated intervals, but the first interest payment date may be for interest accruing for any period not exceeding one (1) year;</p>
                <p>(v) Be made payable in lawful money of the United States at the office of the state treasurer or any commercial bank or commercial banks;</p>
                <p>(vi) Repealed By Laws 2002, Ch. 99, § 3.</p>
                <p>(vii) Be additionally secured by a reserve fund created from revenues deposited within the school lands mineral royalties account under W.S. 9-4-305(b) or from the proceeds of the bonds, or both, in an amount determined by the commission but not to exceed an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the revenue bonds outstanding.</p>
                <p>(e) Before any contract is entered into by the commission to retain the services of a financial advisor or to sell the bonds to an underwriter, whether by competitive or negotiated bid, a full disclosure of the terms of the contract including fees to be paid shall be submitted to the management council through the legislative service office.</p>
                <p>(f) The commission may issue refunding revenue bonds:</p>
                <p>(i) To refund and discharge and extend or shorten the maturities of all or any part of any outstanding bonds issued under this section including any interest thereon in arrears or about to become due;</p>
                <p>(ii) For the purpose of reducing interest costs on bonds issued under this section or effecting other economics; or</p>
                <p>(iii) For the purpose of modifying or eliminating any contractual limitations or provisions contained in any indenture or other proceedings authorizing outstanding bonds issued under this section.</p>
                <p>(g) Any refunding permitted by this subsection shall be accomplished in the manner prescribed by W.S. 16-5-101 through 16-5-119, except any refunding revenue bonds authorized by the commission under this subsection shall not constitute an indebtedness or a debt within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision or limitation or be considered general obligations of the state. The commission shall not pledge the state's full faith and credit to the payment of the refunding revenue bonds. The refunding revenue bonds shall constitute special obligations of the state and may be payable only from the sources authorized in this section for the payment of the bonds refunded. The principal amount of any bonds which have been refunded need not be taken into account in computing compliance with the maximum amounts of bonds authorized to be issued under this section.</p>

                <p>(D) No gross square footage created by any district enhancement shall be included within the district's gross square footage computed under this section unless the enhancement or any portion thereof is determined to be included within the state adequacy standards pursuant to this act.</p>
                <p>(ii) Of the total gross square feet for all school buildings and facilities computed under paragraph (c)(i) of this section, determine the total gross square feet for each of the following building categories:</p>
                <p>(A) Office buildings;</p>
                <p>(B) Repealed By Laws 2001, Ch. 191, § 2.</p>

                <p>(D) Warehouse buildings.</p>
                <p>(iii) Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, adjust the total amount of gross square footage determined for educational buildings under subparagraph (c)(ii)(C) of this section by excluding from computations under this section the square footage for those educational buildings closed and not operational as provided for under paragraph (c)(iv) of this section and any amount including the gross square footage of portable buildings, which exceeds capacity levels specified by this paragraph which are above the statewide minimum gross square footage criteria as prescribed by the statewide building and facility adequacy standards promulgated under W.S. 21-15-115(a). For the purpose of adjusting the gross square footage of educational buildings under this paragraph, the gross square footage of buildings used for the provision of certified child care, developmental preschool and cooperative education programs pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i)(A) of this section shall not be excluded. For purposes of this section, per student gross square footage criteria prescribed by the statewide building adequacy standards shall be based upon an average daily membership (ADM) computed as defined under W.S. 21-13-101(a)(i) for the prior school year. For purposes of computations under this section, the allowable capacity in educational building gross square footage for each district including portable buildings but excluding buildings used for the provision of certified child care, developmental preschool and cooperative education programs pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i)(A) of this section, shall be as follows:</p>
                <p>(A) Repealed by Laws 2018, ch. 36, § 2.</p>

                <p>(C) For school year 2009-2010 and each school year thereafter, up to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the prescribed per student gross square footage criteria.</p>
                <p>(iv) The square footage of any district building or facility which is closed and not operational, is not being replaced under a district's facility plan under W.S. 21-15-116, is not determined surplus by the department and is specified as a closed building within the district's facility plan as a cost efficient means to address future district building needs, shall be segregated from the square footage of other district buildings and facilities and multiplied by the replacement value under paragraph (c)(v) of this section for the appropriate building category. The resulting amount shall then be multiplied by an exterior closure factor established by the department based upon the most current edition of the Whitestone Building Maintenance and Repair Cost Reference Index and added to the total amount determined for the district under paragraph (c)(viii) of this section. This paragraph shall not apply to any school year during which the building or facility is reopened and becomes operational for purposes of delivering the required educational program within the district or to any school year during which the building or facility is used to provide certified child care, developmental preschool or cooperative education programs pursuant to subparagraph (c)(i)(A) of this section;</p>
                <p>(v) Multiply the adjusted square footage amount for each district's educational buildings determined under paragraph (c)(iii) of this section and the amount determined under paragraph (c)(ii) of this section for all remaining building categories of that district, times a replacement value cost factor established for each building category by the department computed using data from August 1 of the prior school year based upon the median estimate in the most current edition of a nationally recognized, quarterly published construction cost index that provides cost indices for elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools, offices and warehouses by city or town, as modified to reflect current Wyoming construction costs determined by the department of administration and information, division of economic analysis;</p>
                <p>(vi) Multiply the amount computed under paragraph (c)(v) of this section for the adjusted square footage of the district's educational buildings times two and one-half percent (2.5%) for school year 2001-2002, three percent (3%) for school year 2002-2003, and by two percent (2%) for school year 2003- 2004 and each school year thereafter;</p>
                <p>(vii) Multiply the sum of the amounts obtained under paragraph (c)(v) of this section for the building categories identified under subparagraphs (c)(ii)(A) and (D) of this section times two and one-half percent (2.5%) for school year 2001-2002, three percent (3%) for school year 2002-2003, and by two percent (2%) for school year 2003-2004 and each school year thereafter, adjusted as follows:</p>
                <p>(A) Determine the proportion that the sum of the square footage for these building categories within the district bears to the educational building square footage computed under subparagraph (c)(ii)(C) of this section, as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(iii) of this section, excluding any square footage included under paragraph (c)(iv) of this section;</p>
                <p>(B) If the proportion is ten percent (10%) or less, the district is entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the amount computed under this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(C) If the proportion is greater than ten percent (10%) but less than sixteen percent (16%), the district is entitled to ninety percent (90%) of the amount computed under this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(D) If the proportion is sixteen percent (16%) or greater but less than twenty-one percent (21%), the district is entitled to eighty percent (80%) of the amount computed under this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(E) If the proportion is twenty-one percent (21%) or greater, the district is entitled to seventy percent (70%) of the amount computed under this paragraph.</p>
                <p>(viii) Total the amounts computed under paragraphs (c)(iv), (vi) and (vii) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) Repealed By Laws 2004, Chapter 114, § 2.</p>
                <p>(e) Amounts distributed under subsection (b) of this section shall be deposited by the recipient district into a separate account, the balance of which may accumulate from year- to-year. Except as specified under subsection (f) of this section, expenditures from the separate account, including any interest earnings on the account, shall be restricted to expenses incurred for major building and facility repair and replacement as defined in subsection (a) of this section and shall be in accordance with the district's facility plan under W.S. 21-15-116. Account expenditures may include the expenses of district personnel performing work described under paragraph (a)(iii) of this section if approved by the department and if documented within the district's facility plan. The district's facility plan shall clearly specify proposed major maintenance expenditures for addressing district major building and facility repair and replacement needs on a building-by-building basis, updated for the applicable reporting period, which shall be aligned to the statewide adequacy standards and prioritized based upon the impact of the building or facility on the district's ability to deliver the required educational program. The district shall include plans for maintaining any district building or facility which is under a lease agreement, specifying lease revenues available to the district for maintenance of facilities to the level required by statewide adequacy standards. No expenditures shall be made from the separate account unless the repair or replacement of the building or facility systems for which the expenditure is to be made is clearly specified within the district's facility plan or otherwise approved by the department. In a manner and form required by commission rule and regulation, each district shall annually report to the department on the expenditures made from the separate account during the applicable reporting period, separating account expenditures on a building-by-building basis. The department shall annually review account expenditures and shall report expenditures to the commission and the select committee on school facilities established under W.S. 28-11-301. The department shall compile reported building-by-building expenditure information for each district and the district facility plan and include this information in its annual report to the select committee pursuant to W.S. 21-15-121. If any district expends funds within the separate account for purposes not authorized by this subsection or by rule and regulation of the commission, the payments for that district shall be reduced by the amount of the unauthorized expenditure in the school year following the year in which the expenditure was discovered or the school year in which notification was provided by the department, whichever first occurs.</p>
                <p>(f) Notwithstanding subsection (e) of this section, a district may expend up to ten percent (10%) of the amount distributed during any school year under subsection (b) of this section for major building and facility repair and replacement needs of the district which are not specified in the district's facility plan, including expenditures for maintenance of district enhancements. Expenditures shall be made under this subsection only after the district's building and facility repair and replacement needs specified in its facility plan have been addressed in accordance with subsection (e) of this section and the department has approved the district's proposed expenditures under this subsection. Amounts not expended for purposes of this subsection during any school year may be accumulated by a district and earmarked within the separate account established under subsection (e) of this section for expenditure under this subsection in subsequent school years, provided the unexpended amount during any school year to be accumulated does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount distributed to the district under subsection (b) of this section for that school year. Each district shall include expenditures under this subsection and any amounts accumulated from year-to- year under this subsection within the annual report required under subsection (e) of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit or limit the application of subparagraph (c)(i)(D) of this section in computing a district's building and facility gross square footage for purposes of determining payment amounts under this section. If any school district exceeds expenditure limitations prescribed by this subsection or fails to comply with expenditure levels for facility adequacy needs identified within its facility plan, the payments for that district in the immediately succeeding year shall be reduced by the excess expenditure amount including any excess expenditure of amounts accumulated under this subsection.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>21-15-119. Commission budget and funding recommendations.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Notwithstanding W.S. 9-2-1012, the commission shall annually, not later than September 1, develop and submit a recommended budget for projects and school capital construction financing to the governor, through the budget division of the department of administration and information and to the select committee on school facilities. The department shall prepare and provide information as requested by the commission. The commission shall include with its recommended budget to the select committee the comprehensive assessment specified in W.S. 21-15-115(b), the prioritized list of projects specified in W.S. 21-15-117 including the amounts allocated to each project and the annual building status report specified under W.S. 21-15-121. The recommended budget submitted by the commission shall include:</p>
                <p>(i) The estimated costs and proposed funding amounts for all projects determined under W.S. 21-15-117 and 21-15-118 and proposed for that budget period, together with estimated expenditures for major building and facility repair and replacement program payments under W.S. 21-15-109 for the same budget period;</p>
                <p>(ii) Financing alternatives for funding the recommended budget, which uses any combination of the following financing alternatives:</p>
                <p>(A) Direct payment from the school capital construction account;</p>
                <p>(B) Proceeds from state revenue bonds issued under W.S. 21-15-108;</p>
                <p>(C) Real property leasing under W.S. 21-15-112. Any payments for real property leasing shall be made from the school capital construction account subject to W.S. 21-15-112. For the purpose of this section, real property leasing includes payments sufficient for the exercise of a purchase option under the lease.</p>
                <p>(iii) In odd-numbered years, the commission's recommendation on September 1 shall be for expenditures during the two (2) succeeding fiscal years. The recommendation for the second year shall be based on estimates of expenditures and payments. In even-numbered years, the commission's recommendation on September 1 shall be for expenditures during the succeeding fiscal year. As it determines to be necessary in any year, the commission's recommendation on September 1 may contain a recommendation for revised expenditures during the current fiscal year.</p>
                <p>(b) The department may enter into agreements under which the department may make payments on behalf of a school district with respect to the district's lease of school facilities under W.S. 21-15-112. The department may also enter into any agreement with a nonprofit corporation or other entity necessary to ensure that a district can lease facilities under W.S. 21-15-112.</p>
                <p>(c) Budgets submitted by the commission under subsection</p>
                <p>(a) of this section and recommended by the select committee under W.S. 28-11-301 shall be attached to specified projects for the applicable budget period, which projects shall be referred to as planning and design phase projects and construction phase projects. With the approval of the governor, the department may transfer up to fifteen percent (15%) of the total funds appropriated between project phases. Any modification of appropriation expenditures between project phases shall be reported to the select committee in accordance with W.S. 28-11-301(c)(iv). Additionally, the commission may for any budget period specify amounts within its budget which are recommended to cover inflation, unanticipated costs, off-site infrastructure costs and other such contingency or special project costs provided the additional costs are reported and approved in accordance with W.S. 28-11-301(c)(iv). Amounts appropriated by the legislature shall not be construed to be an entitlement or guaranteed amount and shall be expended by the department in accordance with facility guidelines to ensure adequate, efficient and cost effective school buildings and facilities as required by W.S. 21-15-114(a)(vii).</p>

                  <p>The legislature of the state of Wyoming hereby approves, ratifies and adopts the "Western Regional Higher Education Compact", approved by the western governors conference meeting at Denver, Colorado on November 10, 1950, which compact is as follows:</p>
                  <p>Article I</p>
                  <p>Whereas, the future of this nation and of the western states is dependent upon the quality of the education of its youth; and Whereas, many of the western states individually do not have sufficient numbers of potential students to warrant the establishment and maintenance within their borders of adequate facilities in all of the essential fields of technical, professional, and graduate training, nor do all of the states have the financial ability to furnish within their borders institutions capable of providing acceptable standards of training in all of the fields mentioned above; and Whereas, it is believed that the western states, or groups of such states within the region, cooperatively can provide acceptable and efficient educational facilities to meet the needs of the region and of the students thereof:</p>
                  <p>Now, therefore, the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and the territories of Alaska and Hawaii do hereby covenant and agree as follows:</p>
                  <p>Article II</p>
                  <p>Each of the compacting states and territories pledges to each of the other compacting states and territories faithful cooperation in carrying out all the purposes of this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article III</p>
                  <p>The compacting states and territories hereby create the western interstate commission for higher education, hereinafter called the commission. Said commission shall be a body corporate of each compacting state and territory and an agency thereof. The commission shall have all the powers and duties set forth herein, including the power to sue and be sued, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states and territories.</p>
                  <p>Article IV</p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall consist of three (3) resident members from each compacting state or territory. At all times one (1) commissioner from each compacting state or territory shall be an educator engaged in the field of higher education in the state or territory for which he is appointed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioners from each state and territory shall be appointed by the governor thereof as provided by law in such state or territory. Any commissioner may be removed or suspended from office as provided by law of the state or territory from which he shall have been appointed. The terms of each commissioner shall be four (4) years; provided however that the first three (3) commissioners shall be appointed as follows: one (1) for two (2) years, one (1) for three (3) years, and one (1) for four (4) years. Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor shall be appointed and qualified. If any office becomes vacant for any reason, the governor shall appoint a commissioner to fill the office for the remainder of the unexpired term.</p>
                  <p>Article V</p>
                  <p>(a) Any business transacted at any meeting of the commission must be by affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states and territories.</p>
                  <p>(b) One (1) or more commissioners from a majority of the compacting states and territories shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.</p>
                  <p>(c) Each compacting state and territory represented at any meeting of the commission is entitled to one (1) vote.</p>
                  <p>Article VI</p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice chairman, and may appoint, and at its pleasure dismiss or remove, such officers, agents, and employees as may be required to carry out the purpose of this compact; and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation, having due regard for the importance of the responsibilities involved.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioners shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses from the funds of the commission.</p>
                  <p>Article VII</p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall adopt a seal and bylaws and shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for its management and control.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission may elect such committees as it deems necessary for the carrying out of its functions.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall establish and maintain an office within one (1) of the compacting states for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time but in any event must meet at least once a year. The chairmen may call such additional meetings and upon the request of a majority of the commissioners of three (3) or more compacting states or territories shall call additional meetings.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission shall submit a budget to the governor of each compacting state and territory at such time and for such period as may be required.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commission shall, after negotiations with interested institutions, determine the cost of providing the facilities for graduate and professional education for use in its contractual agreements throughout the region.</p>
                  <p>(f) On or before the fifteenth day of January of each year, the commission shall submit to the governors and legislatures of the compacting states and territories a report of its activities for the preceding calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(g) The commission shall keep accurate books of account, showing in full its receipts and disbursements, and said books of account shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by the governor of any compacting state or territory or his designated representative. The commission shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedure of any of the compacting states or territories. The commission shall provide for an independent annual audit.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII</p>
                  <p>(a) It shall be the duty of the commission to enter into such contractual agreements with any institutions in the region offering graduate or professional education and with any of the compacting states or territories as may be required in the judgment of the commission to provide adequate services and facilities of graduate and professional education for the citizens of the respective compacting states or territories.</p>
                  <p>The commission shall first endeavor to provide adequate services and facilities in the fields of dentistry, medicine, public health, and veterinary medicine, and may undertake similar activities in other professional and graduate fields.</p>
                  <p>(b) For this purpose the commission may enter into contractual agreements:</p>
                  <p>(i) With the governing authority of any educational institution in the region, or with any compacting state or territory, to provide such graduate or professional educational services upon terms and conditions to be agreed upon between contracting parties; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) With the governing authority of any educational institution in the region or with any compacting state or territory to assist in the placement of graduate or professional students in educational institutions in the region providing the desired services and facilities, upon such terms and conditions as the commission may prescribe.</p>
                  <p>(c) It shall be the duty of the commission to undertake studies of needs for professional and graduate educational facilities in the region, the resources for meeting such needs, and the long-range effects of the compact on higher education; and from time to time to prepare comprehensive reports on such research for presentation to the western governor's conference and to the legislatures of the compacting states and territories. In conducting such studies the commission may confer with any national or regional planning body which may be established. The commission shall draft and recommend to the governors of the various compacting states and territories, uniform legislation dealing with problems of higher education in the region.</p>
                  <p>(d) For the purposes of this compact the word "region" shall be construed to mean the geographical limits of the several compacting states and territories.</p>
                  <p>Article IX</p>
                  <p>The operating costs of the commission shall be apportioned equally among the compacting states and territories.</p>
                  <p>Article X</p>
                  <p>This compact shall become operative and binding immediately as to those states and territories adopting it whenever five (5) or more of the states or territories of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii have duly adopted it prior to July 1, 1953. This compact shall become effective as to any additional states or territories adopting thereafter at the time of such adoption.</p>
                  <p>Article XI</p>
                  <p>This compact may be terminated at any time by consent of a majority of the compacting states or territories. Consent shall be manifested by passage and signature in the usual manner of legislation expressing such consent by the legislature and governor of such terminating state. Any state or territory may at any time withdraw from this compact by means of appropriate legislation to that end. Such withdrawal shall not become effective until two (2) years after written notice thereof by the governor of the withdrawing state or territory accompanied by a certified copy of the requisite legislative action as received by the commission. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state or territory from its obligation hereunder accruing prior to the effective date of withdrawal. The withdrawing state or territory may rescind its action of withdrawal at any time within the two (2) year period.</p>
                  <p>Thereafter, the withdrawing state or territory may be reinstated by application to and the approval by a majority vote of the commission.</p>
                  <p>Article XII</p>
                  <p>(a) If any compacting state or territory shall at any time default in the performance of any of its obligations assumed or imposed in accordance with the provisions of this compact, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact or agreements hereunder shall be suspended from the effective date of such default as fixed by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless such default shall be remedied within a period of two (2) years following the effective date of such default, this compact may be terminated with respect to such defaulting state or territory by affirmative vote of three-fourths of the other member states or territories.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any such defaulting state may be reinstated by:</p>
                  <p>(i) Performing all acts and obligations upon which it has heretofore defaulted; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Application to and the approval by a majority vote of the commission.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-16-202. When binding; notice of ratification; power of governor to appoint commissioners; powers of commissioners generally; appropriation of monies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The compact shall become operative and binding at the time provided, and in accordance with article X of the compact. The governor of Wyoming shall give notice of the approval, ratification and adoption of the compact by the legislature of the state of Wyoming, to the governors of each of the states and territories named in article X of the compact. The governor shall appoint the commissioners for which provision is made in the compact and the commissioners shall have the power and authority specified in the compact, and such other power and authority as may hereafter be prescribed by law.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to those powers granted to the commissioners in the compact, the commissioners are directed and empowered:</p>
                  <p>(i) To control and authorize the expenditure of any funds appropriated for carrying out the provisions of the compact;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To ratify any contracts entered into by the western interstate commission for higher education or its officers which are deemed to be in the best interest of the state of Wyoming and its qualified students;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To impose residency requirements on admission to compact programs. Applicants may appeal any admission decisions rendered pursuant to this paragraph directly to the commission; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the interest of recruiting health care professionals to Wyoming, to impose a repayment program for participating students in dentistry, medicine, podiatry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, optometry, physician assistant programs and osteopathic medicine and obtain an agreement from each student first admitted as a WICHE program student to a participating institution of higher education for the 2013-2014 academic year and thereafter, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The student agrees to:</p>
                  <p>(I) Actively engage in full-time professional practice in Wyoming in the field in which he was educated for not less than three (3) years as the commission requires. The taking of a medical residency program in the state shall be credited toward the practice requirements at the rate of one-third (1/3) year of full-time practice for each year of service in a medical residency program in the state; or</p>
                  <p>(II) Repay all amounts expended by the state of Wyoming on the student's education through the WICHE program, together with interest which shall begin accruing after the student's graduation or residency, whichever is later, but in no event later than eight (8) years after the student enters into an agreement, upon terms specified by the commission. However, interest shall begin to accrue when the student has withdrawn from the professional school or a residency program as determined by the commission or is otherwise not making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree program as determined by the commission. Money expended under this paragraph shall accrue at an annual interest rate equal to that charged for federal Stafford loans at the time interest begins to accrue, which rate shall be adjusted annually to equal the federal Stafford loan rate. In no event shall the interest rate be greater than eight percent (8%).</p>
                  <p>(B) Upon application of the student, the commission may relieve a student of the obligation to repay amounts expended under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, in whole or in part, where repayment would cause undue hardship. The commission shall annually report the number of students relieved from repayment under this subparagraph to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee not later than October 1;</p>
                  <p>(C) Any amounts paid by medical, podiatry, osteopathic, occupational therapy, physical therapy, optometry, physician assistant or dental students in accordance with the contractual arrangements authorized under this paragraph shall be credited to a WICHE program repayment account which shall be expended upon appropriation by the legislature;</p>
                  <p>(D) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to the field of veterinary medicine.</p>
                  <p>(c) All monies appropriated for the purposes of the compact shall be appropriated to the board of trustees of the University of Wyoming for administration as directed by the commissioners.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-16-301. Generally.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The Interstate Compact for Education is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining herein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>COMPACT FOR EDUCATION</p>
                  <p>Article I</p>
                  <p>(a) It is the purpose of this compact to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Establish and maintain close cooperation and understanding among executive, legislative, professional, educational and lay leadership on a nationwide basis at the state and local levels.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide a forum for the discussion, development, crystallization and recommendation of public policy alternatives in the field of education.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide a clearinghouse of information on matters relating to educational programs and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Facilitate the improvement of state and local educational systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society which requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advance in educational opportunities, methods and facilities.</p>
                  <p>(b) It is the policy of this compact to encourage and promote local and state initiative in the development, maintenance, improvement and administration of educational systems and institutions in a manner which will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states.</p>
                  <p>(c) The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the nation, and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.</p>
                  <p>Article II</p>
                  <p>As used in the compact, "state" means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
                  <p>Article III</p>
                  <p>(a) The education commission of the states, hereinafter called "the commission", is hereby established. The commission shall consist of seven (7) members representing each party state. One (1) of such members shall be the governor; two (2) shall be members of the state legislature selected by its respective houses and serving in such manner as the legislature may determine, Wyoming's legislative members are to be appointed one (1) by the president of the senate and one (1) by the speaker of the house; and four (4) shall be appointed by the governor and may be removed by the governor as provided in W.S. 9-1-202. If the laws of a state prevent legislators from serving on the commission, six (6) members shall be appointed and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. In addition to any other principles or requirements which a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the commission from each party state shall be that the members representing such state shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge or affiliations be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education, lay and professional, public and nonpublic educational leadership. Of those appointees, one (1) shall be the head of a state agency or institution, designated by the governor, having responsibility for one (1) or more programs of public education. In addition to the members of the commission representing the party states, there may be not to exceed ten (10) nonvoting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one (1) year. Such commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or persons concerned with educational administration.</p>
                  <p>(b) The members of the commission shall be entitled to one (1) vote each on the commission. No action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission are cast in favor thereof. Action of the commission shall be only at meetings at which a majority of the commissioners are present. The commission shall meet at least once a year. In its bylaws, and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the commission may delegate the exercise of any of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director, except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to article IV and adoption of the annual report pursuant to subsection (k) of this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall have a seal.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, who shall be a governor, a vice-chairman and a treasurer. The commission shall provide for the appointment of an executive director. Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the commission may deem appropriate shall be bonded in such amount as the commission shall determine. The executive director shall be secretary.</p>
                  <p>(e) Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director subject to the approval of the steering committee shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. The commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the commission.</p>
                  <p>(f) The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any party jurisdiction, the United States, or any subdivision or agency of the aforementioned governments, or from any agency of two (2) or more of the party jurisdictions or their subdivisions.</p>
                  <p>(g) The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, foundation, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission. Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed, and the identity of the donor or lender.</p>
                  <p>(h) The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.</p>
                  <p>(j) The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.</p>
                  <p>(k) The commission annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year. The commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.</p>
                  <p>Article IV</p>
                  <p>(a) In addition to authority conferred on the commission by other provisions of the compact, the commission shall have authority to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Collect, correlate, analyze and interpret information and data concerning educational needs and resources.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Encourage and foster research in all aspects of education, but with special reference to the desirable scope of instruction, organization, administration, and instructional methods and standards employed or suitable for employment in public educational systems.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Develop proposals for adequate financing of education as a whole and at each of its many levels.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Conduct or participate in research of the types referred to in this article in any instance where the commission finds that such research is necessary for the advancement of the purposes and policies of this compact, utilizing fully the resources of national associations, regional compact organizations for higher education, and other agencies and institutions, both public and private.</p>
                  <p>(v) Formulate suggested policies and plans for the improvement of public education as a whole, or for any segment thereof, and make recommendations with respect thereto available to the appropriate governmental units, agencies and public officials.</p>
                  <p>(vi) Do such other things as may be necessary or incidental to the administration of any of its authority or functions pursuant to this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article V</p>
                  <p>(a) If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefor within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the commission by not to exceed ten (10) representatives. Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, and may be drawn from any one (1) or more branches of the federal government, but no such representative shall have a vote on the commission.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission may provide information and make recommendations to any executive or legislative agency or officer of the federal government concerning the common educational policies of the states, and may advise with any such agencies or officers concerning any matter of mutual interest.</p>
                  <p>Article VI</p>
                  <p>(a) To assist in the expeditious conduct of its business when the full commission is not meeting, the commission shall elect a steering committee of thirty-two (32) members which, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall be constituted and function as provided in the bylaws of the commission.</p>
                  <p>One-fourth of the voting membership of the steering committee shall consist of governors, one-fourth shall consist of legislators, and the remainder shall consist of other members of the commission. A federal representative on the commission may serve with the steering committee, but without vote. The voting members of the steering committee shall serve for terms of two (2) years, except that members elected to the first steering committee of the commission shall be elected as follows: sixteen (16) for one (1) year and sixteen (16) for two (2) years. The chairman, vice-chairman, and treasurer of the commission shall be members of the steering committee and, anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, shall serve during their continuance in these offices. Vacancies in the steering committee shall not affect its authority to act, but the commission at its next regularly ensuing meeting following the occurrence of any vacancy shall fill it for the unexpired term. No person shall serve more than two (2) terms as a member of the steering committee; provided that service for a partial term of one (1) year or less shall not be counted towards the two (2) term limitation.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one (1) or more of its functions. Any advisory or technical committee may, on request of the states concerned, be established to consider any matter of special concern to two (2) or more of the party states.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may provide.</p>
                  <p>Article VII</p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall advise the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state of its budget and estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state. Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.</p>
                  <p>(b) The total amount of appropriation requests under any budget shall be apportioned among the party states. In making such apportionment, the commission shall devise and employ a formula which takes equitable account of the populations and per capita income levels of the party states.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party states. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it pursuant to article III(g) of this compact, provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring an obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it pursuant to article III (g) thereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established by its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual reports of the commission.</p>
                  <p>(e) The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII</p>
                  <p>(a) This compact shall have as eligible parties all states, territories, and possessions of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In respect of any such jurisdiction not having a governor, the term "governor", as used in this compact, shall mean the closest equivalent official of such jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any state or other eligible jurisdiction may enter into this compact and it shall become binding thereon when it has adopted the same; provided that in order to enter into initial effect, adoption by at least ten (10) eligible party jurisdictions shall be required.</p>
                  <p>(c) Adoption of the compact may be either by enactment thereof or by adherence thereto by the governor; provided that in the absence of enactment adherence by the governor shall be sufficient to make his state a party only until December 31, 1967. During any period when a state is participating in this compact through gubernatorial action, the governor shall appoint those persons who, in addition to himself, shall serve as the members of the commission from his state, and shall provide to the commission an equitable share of the financial support of the commission from any source available to him.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except for a withdrawal effective on December 31, 1967, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this article, any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>Article IX</p>
                  <p>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p>(i) Payments received on student loans including principal, interest and penalties and other income rendered in connection with student loans;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Proceeds of insurance, earnings and profits on investments of funds and from sales, purchases, endorsements of student loans and other contract rights;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any funds, rights, proceeds of insurance or other benefits acquired pursuant to any federal law or contract to the extent not in conflict therewith;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Money recovered through the enforcement of any remedies or rights; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Any other funds or things of value becoming the property of the authority, which in the determination of the authority, may enhance the marketability of its revenue obligations.</p>
                  <p>(b) The holders of obligations shall not look to any general or other fund for payment of the obligations except the revenues pledged or assigned under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Revenue obligations shall not constitute an indebtedness or a debt of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision or limitation. The obligations shall not be considered or held to be general, special or limited obligations of the state but shall constitute the special obligations of the authority for which the state shall not pledge its full faith and credit for payment on the obligations.</p>
                  <p>(d) The resolution or trust indenture under which the revenue obligations are authorized and any other instrument may contain agreements and provisions for:</p>
                  <p>(i) The creation and maintenance of special funds from revenues; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The rights and remedies available in the event of default.</p>
                  <p>(e) Each pledge, agreement or other instrument made for the benefit or security of any obligations of the authority is valid and binding from the time made. The revenues, receipts, monies and assets pledged are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without delivery or further act. The lien is valid and binding against persons having claims of any kind against the authority whether or not the persons have actual notice of the lien. Neither the resolution nor the indenture or other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any resolution or trust indenture under which obligations of the authority are authorized may contain provisions for vesting in a trustee the properties, rights, powers and duties in trust as the authority determines.</p>

                  <p>(i) Payment of the principal of obligations of the authority secured by the reserve fund, as the obligations mature or are redeemed prior to maturity;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Purchase of the obligations of the authority;</p>

                  <p>(b) The interest earned on the amount deposited in any reserve fund may be used for defraying the cost of the operations of the authority. Money in any debt service reserve fund shall not be withdrawn if it would reduce the amount of the fund to less than the amount which is pledged in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the obligations secured by the debt service reserve fund, except for paying principal and interest on obligations maturing and becoming due and for the payment of which other monies of the authority are not available.</p>

                  <p>(a) The authority shall establish and at all times maintain one (1) or more adequate reserve funds to provide for defaults on student loans financed pursuant to this article. All financial institutions offering loans to be financed pursuant to this article and the authority, on all loans made directly to students pursuant to this article, shall charge a loan reserve fee of not more than five percent (5%) of the total face amount of the loan. The authority may from time to time decrease this percentage in furtherance of this plan. In order for a loan to qualify for default coverage by the authority under this article, the financial institution shall deposit the loan reserve fee into reserve funds established by the authority under this section. The authority shall establish procedures for the collection and deposit of the loan reserve fee and for the payment of defaults on secured loans. The loan reserve fee is not a finance charge for purposes of any state or federal consumer credit law.</p>
                  <p>(b) In the event of a default on any loan owned by the authority or security obligation of the authority, the authority shall take all lawful steps to collect on all loans acquired, administered or financed pursuant to this article and in accordance with commercially reasonable terms and subject to any applicable state or federal statutes, may contract with a private collection agent for loan collection.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event of a default on any loan not owned by the authority but administered or financed pursuant to this article, the authority shall as soon as practicable after receipt of demand by a financial institution containing a statement of the nature and the reason for the default, pay, from the loan reserve funds established pursuant to this article, to the financial institution one hundred percent (100%) of the unpaid balance of the principal on the note. Upon payment, the financial institution shall endorse, without recourse or warranty, and deliver to the authority the note, together with all of the rights of the financial institution under any guaranty or endorsement of the note and with respect to any security for the payment of the note.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to approval of the governor and advice of the attorney general, the state treasurer may enter into standby commitment agreements for a commercially reasonable fee with the authority under which the state agrees to purchase loans held by the authority at any time the authority is unable to pay interest on or principal of any of its outstanding obligations on any regularly scheduled interest or principal payment date, or at maturity, whether by acceleration, redemption or otherwise. One (1) condition of the agreement shall require the loan program to be designed for statewide participation and benefits. If the commitment is incurred, the investment shall be made from the Wyoming permanent mineral trust fund or permanent land fund and shall not exceed one hundred seventy-five million dollars ($175,000,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) If loans are sold, the authority shall, as partial consideration for the sale, retain the responsibility for collection and procedural processing of the loans at its sole expense with the exception of servicing fees as specified in the standby commitment agreement. In no case shall the state be obliged to administer loans purchased from the authority. The portion of any payment reflecting a return of corpus shall be credited to the permanent mineral trust fund or permanent land fund and the balance of the payment shall be credited to the general fund or the permanent land income fund, as applicable.</p>

                  <p>(iii) "Substantial endowment gift" means an irrevocable gift or transfer to the University of Wyoming foundation of money or other property by a donor where:</p>
                  <p>(A) The gift or the foundation's interest in the property is conditioned on it being used by the foundation exclusively for endowment purposes;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-16-904. Endowment challenge fund matching fund program; matching payments; agreements with university foundation; annual reports; reversions of appropriations; legislative oversight.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The state treasurer shall administer the matching fund program established under this section. The following shall apply to the program:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent that funds are available in the challenge account, the state treasurer shall match each substantial endowment gift actually received by the University of Wyoming foundation by transferring from the challenge account to the university an amount equal to the amount of the substantial endowment gift. Prior to the receipt of any substantial endowment gift, the donor shall be notified by the foundation that there may or may not be any state matching funds available for the gift. If funds are not available within the account, the amount of substantial endowment gifts to the foundation may be accumulated until such time as matching funds become available. Endowment gifts made directly to the university shall be endowment gifts to the foundation for purposes of this section. The university shall manage both the endowment gifts and the matching funds in the same manner as other endowment funds, but otherwise subject to the provisions of this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The state treasurer shall make transfers to the university under this section not later than the end of the calendar quarter following the quarter during which the gift is received. Matching funds shall only be available for expenditure to the extent cash or cash equivalent contributions are actually received by the University of Wyoming. Where a gift is made through a series of payments or transfers, except as provided in paragraph (ix) of this subsection, no matching funds shall be transferred by the state treasurer until the total value of all payments or transfers actually received toward the gift totals at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). Thereafter, matching funds shall be transferred as payments or transfers toward that gift are received by the foundation. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the university foundation from accumulating substantial endowment gifts until such time as state matching funds become available;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The university shall immediately transfer all matching funds received to the university foundation to be permanently invested. The university shall enter into a new agreement or modify its existing agreement with the University of Wyoming foundation under which the foundation shall manage the matching funds it receives in the same manner as other permanent endowment funds managed by the University of Wyoming foundation subject to the provisions of this section.</p>
                  <p>Expenditures may be made from that portion of the funds attributable to endowment gifts received in accordance with the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding that act, only the earnings from the investment of state matching funds may be expended for purposes other than reasonable costs of administration. All expenditures shall be used exclusively for the purposes of the endowment, including reasonable costs of administration. Earnings also may be reinvested to increase the balance of the corpus. Reasonable costs of administration shall not exceed an annual rate of one percent (1%) of the fair value of each state matching fund account held by the foundation that is associated with a substantial endowment gift received by the foundation under W.S. 21-16-902(a)(iii). The costs of administration shall be assessed quarterly at one-fourth (1/4) the annual rate as specified in this subsection or as otherwise specified by law. The fair value of each state matching fund account held by the foundation shall be determined by the foundation as of the last day of the preceding quarter. Any modification of costs of administration allowed shall be effected through a footnote to the University of Wyoming's general appropriation in the general government appropriations bill or in a 300 section of the general government appropriations bill. Upon the modification of any costs of administration to an amount above one percent (1%), the University of Wyoming foundation shall submit to the joint appropriations interim committee a detailed financial accounting of all costs of administration incurred during the fiscal year;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The state treasurer shall distribute funds or encumber funds for future distribution in the case of a written commitment, to match a substantial endowment gift based on the order in which each substantial endowment gift is actually received or in which a written commitment to make a substantial endowment gift is received by the foundation. Matching funds shall not be distributed or encumbered in excess of the amount in the challenge account. In no event shall matching funds be transferred to the university except to match substantial endowment gifts actually received or to match gifts actually received and accumulated. The state treasurer shall rescind an encumbrance if the university notifies him that a donor who made a commitment will not make a substantial endowment gift that qualifies for matching funds under this section;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the president of the university determines that the purpose of a substantial endowment gift to the foundation is not consistent with mission or capability of the university, the gift shall not qualify for the matching program under this section;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For the purpose of calculating the matching amount only, the state treasurer shall use the value of a substantial endowment gift based on its fair market value at the time the gift is received by the university foundation. The university shall provide evidence of fair market value as the state treasurer requires for each substantial endowment gift. The state treasurer's office shall not bear any costs associated with providing evidence;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The University of Wyoming shall on or before October 1 of each year submit a report to the state treasurer from the foundation regarding the endowment matching program established under this section for the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include a financial summary and a review of the accomplishments resulting from endowment program expenditures. The state treasurer shall distribute the report to the governor and the legislature;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 52, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(ix) To the extent funds are available in the challenge account, the state treasurer shall distribute matching funds not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each fallen heroes endowment as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for the first one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) actually received in a fallen heroes endowment; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) for an additional one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) received in a fallen heroes endowment, excluding any funds deposited in a fallen heroes endowment pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any funds appropriated to a university endowment fund by the legislature shall be credited to the university fund endowment challenge account under W.S. 21-16-903.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this section obligates the legislature to match accumulated substantial endowment gifts as authorized under subsection (a) of this section. The legislature reserves the right to modify or terminate the matching program at any time.</p>
                  <p>(d) As used in this section "earnings from the investment of state matching funds" means that amount of net appreciation, realized and unrealized, in the fair value of assets of the endowment fund attributable to all state matching funds which exceeds the total amount of those state matching funds when distributed by the state treasurer to the university.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state treasurer shall administer the university athletics challenge account established under this article. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent that funds are available in the challenge account, the state treasurer shall match each qualifying contribution actually received by the University of Wyoming foundation by transferring from the challenge account to the university an amount equal to the amount of the qualifying contribution. Qualifying contributions made directly to the university shall be considered qualifying contributions to the foundation for purposes of this article. The university shall expend both the qualifying contributions and the matching funds solely for the cost of establishing new or renovating existing university intercollegiate athletics facilities consistent with the 2003 intercollegiate athletics plan approved by the university board of trustees. Authorized expenditures for intercollegiate athletic facilities include but are not limited to all expenditures necessary for planning, designing, procuring contractors, construction management and actual construction;</p>

Thereafter, matching funds shall be transferred as payments or transfers toward that qualifying contribution are received by the foundation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The state treasurer shall distribute funds or encumber funds for future distribution in the case of a written commitment, to match a qualifying contribution based on the order in which each qualifying contribution is actually received or in which a written commitment to make a qualifying contribution is received by the foundation. Matching funds shall not be distributed or encumbered in excess of the amount within the challenge account. No matching funds shall be transferred to the university except to match qualifying contributions actually received. The state treasurer shall rescind an encumbrance if the university notifies him that a donor who made a commitment will not make a qualifying contribution that is eligible for matching funds under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For the purpose of calculating the matching amount only, the state treasurer shall use the value of a qualifying contribution based on its fair market value at the time the contribution is received by the university foundation. The university shall provide evidence of fair market value as the state treasurer requires for each qualifying contribution. The state treasurer's office shall not bear any costs associated with providing evidence;</p>

                  <p>(a) To the extent funds are available in the separate account of any community college within the endowment challenge fund, the state treasurer shall match endowment gifts actually received by that community college's foundation. Except as provided in subsection (k) of this section, a match shall be paid under this subsection by the state treasurer at the time any accumulated amounts actually received by a community college foundation total ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more. Matching funds shall only be available for expenditure to the extent cash or cash equivalent contributions are actually received by the community college. Endowment gifts actually received by a community college foundation may also be accumulated until such time as state matching funds become available. The match shall be made by transferring from the separate challenge fund account to the appropriate community college an amount equal to the amount accumulated by its foundation. The recipient community college shall immediately transfer matching funds received under this subsection to the community college foundation.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each community college district shall enter into an agreement with its foundation under which the foundation shall manage the matching funds received under subsection (a) of this section in the same manner as other permanent endowment funds are managed by its foundation, including the permanent investment of funds, maintenance of the fund corpus as inviolate and the expenditure of fund earnings for endowment purposes only.</p>

Prior to the receipt of any substantial endowment gift, the donor shall be notified by the foundation that there may or may not be any state matching funds available for the gift. If funds are not available for any community college account, the amount of gifts to that foundation may be accumulated until such time as matching funds become available.

The community college shall provide evidence of fair market value for any gift if requested by the state treasurer and shall fund the cost of providing any requested evidence.</p>
                  <p>(j) Each community college shall on or before October 1 of each year submit a report from its foundation to the state treasurer and the community college commission on the endowment matching program under this section for the preceding fiscal year.

                  <p>(m) Nothing in this section obligates the legislature to match accumulated endowment gifts authorized under this section. The legislature reserves the right to modify or terminate the matching program at any time.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Upon request of a student applying to an eligible institution and initially applying for a Hathaway scholarship, each school district shall provide to the eligible institution an official transcript of the student's academic record through the student's most recent semester of attendance. Following graduation and upon the student's request the school district shall also provide to the eligible institution an official transcript of the student's complete academic record.</p>
                  <p>All transcripts provided pursuant to this paragraph shall designate each course which satisfies the success curriculum requirements established under W.S. 21-16-1307;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For students transferring from an eligible institution to another eligible institution and making application for continuance of a scholarship, the institution from which the student is transferring shall at the student's request provide an official transcript to the new institution and shall provide a list of all semesters of attendance in which a Hathaway scholarship was received by the student and, if applicable, a list of all semesters for which a student previously qualifying for a Hathaway scholarship was determined ineligible for the Hathaway scholarship;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Each eligible institution receiving an application from a student applying for a Hathaway scholarship shall preliminarily determine the student's eligibility for the scholarship. For students initially applying for a scholarship, unless the student's complete academic record is available, the GPA used to preliminarily determine eligibility shall be based upon the student's official high school transcript after either the end of the first semester of a student's senior year or the second semester of a student's junior year, at the sole discretion of the eligible institution. For students graduating prior to their senior year the GPA used to preliminarily determine eligibility shall be based upon the student's official high school transcript as of the end of the semester immediately prior to the last semester before the student's graduation. High school GPAs for final eligibility determinations for students initially applying for a scholarship under this article shall be based upon the student's complete high school academic record. Upon final determination of scholarship eligibility, each community college shall certify to the community college commission not later than thirty (30) days after the semester commences, a list of students enrolled at the institution who qualify for a scholarship under this article, including the amount of each scholarship. The university shall certify to the department within forty-five (45) days after the semester commences a like list for students enrolled at the university.

                  <p>(v) The department shall determine and certify to the state treasurer the amount which is equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the total amount the eligible institution received during the preceding semester under this subsection. Not later than September 1 for the fall semester and not later than January 15 for the spring semester, the state treasurer shall pay from the scholarship expenditure account the amount certified by the department. The department shall review the lists provided under paragraph (iv) of this subsection, determine whether there is any duplication of students, and determine and certify to the state treasurer the balance of the amount due under this article to each institution for the semester. For any duplication, the department shall determine whether the student is attending more than one (1) eligible institution. If the student is attending multiple eligible institutions payment of the Hathaway scholarship for which the student qualifies shall be made only to the institution designated as the home institution by the student. The state treasurer shall pay from the scholarship expenditure account the balance of the amount due. Payments of the balance due under this paragraph shall be made not later than seventy-five (75) days after the institution's semester has commenced. Payments to the university shall be made directly to the university. Payments to the community colleges shall be made directly to each college and be reported by the state treasurer to the community college commission. Should a prepayment under this paragraph exceed the amount actually due the institution for any semester, the excess amount shall be calculated by the department and deducted from the next payment made. For purposes of this subsection, payments due for summer terms shall be included within the calculations and payments for the subsequent fall semester.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Funds available for scholarships under W.S. 21-16-1306 shall be used for scholarships under W.S. 21-16-1304 and 21-16-1305 after all scholarships under W.S. 21-16-1306 have been paid;</p>
                  <p>(iii) After all funds within the expenditure account have been expended, funds within the Hathaway student scholarship reserve account shall be used to fund any remaining scholarships awarded under this article;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If no funds remain available in the expenditure account or reserve account at the time payment is required to be made to an institution for any semester, the payment to the eligible institutions shall be reduced on a first come first served basis using the student's application date for the scholarship.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created the Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship. The scholarship shall be administered by the department in accordance with this section and rules adopted by the department. Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship recipients shall be selected by a committee comprised of the governor, state superintendent of public instruction, president of the University of Wyoming and executive director of the community college commission, or their designees.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each year up to two (2) students from each state contiguous to Wyoming may be awarded a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship, not to exceed an aggregate of twenty-four (24) active awards at any time. Awards of Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarships shall be contingent on available funds and anticipated revenue to the Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship expenditure account. Minimum initial qualifications for a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship shall be all initial requirements applicable to a Hathaway honor scholarship, other than Wyoming residency and graduation from a high school located in Wyoming. In addition to those requirements, recipients shall have:</p>
                  <p>(i) A minimum cumulative high school GPA of 3.75 and a score equal to or greater than the 2015-2016 national percentile rank of ninety-seven (97) on an examination administered throughout the United States and relied upon by institutions of higher education to determine acceptance of students for attendance;</p>
                  <p>(ii) At the time of graduation, be a resident of a state contiguous to Wyoming and have successfully completed a curriculum at least as stringent as that imposed under W.S. 21- 16-1307 for Hathaway honor scholarships.</p>
                  <p>(c) A Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship shall be for the student's cost of attendance at an eligible institution, but not to exceed the maximum dollar amount provided to students receiving a trustee scholarship at the University of Wyoming and subject to reduction in accordance with W.S. 21-16-1309(a). No student shall be eligible for a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship for more than the equivalent of eight (8) full-time semesters. Minimum continuing eligibility and reinstatement eligibility requirements for a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship shall be the same as requirements for a Hathaway honors scholarship. These minimum requirements may be increased by rule of the department to requirements no more stringent than those imposed by the University of Wyoming for recipients of a trustee scholarship. Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarships may be reduced in the same manner and to lower levels as provided for Hathaway honor scholarships for failure to meet continuing eligibility requirements.</p>
                  <p>(d) Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarships shall not be subject to the provisions of W.S. 21-16-1308, but shall be administered by the department in accordance with the provisions of this section and the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The department shall, in consultation with University of Wyoming and community college admissions officers and financial aid officers, promulgate rules necessary to implement this section. The consultation shall include development of a means for informing students in contiguous states of the availability of Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarships;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Eligible institutions shall provide information required by the department as necessary to fulfill its duties under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Students shall apply for Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarships with the department at the time of applying for admission or at an earlier time as established by rule of the department. The application shall contain information required by rule of the department. The application shall require each applicant to verify under penalty of false swearing under W.S. 6-5-303, that the applicant has not been convicted of a felony in this state or another jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The department shall determine and certify to the state treasurer the amount of scholarships awarded under this section for attendance at each eligible institution not later than September 1 for the fall semester and not later than January 15 for the spring semester. Upon receipt of the certification the state treasurer shall pay from the scholarship expenditure account the amount certified by the department;</p>
                  <p>(v) The same information required to be reported under W.S. 21-16-1308 for Hathaway opportunity, performance and honor scholarships shall be reported for Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarships awarded.</p>
                  <p>(e) Before awarding a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship, the department shall obtain an agreement from each student, or the student's guardian, under which the student agrees to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Actively engage in work in Wyoming for one (1) year or attend graduate school at the University of Wyoming for one (1) year, for every four (4) academic semesters or portions thereof in which a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship was received. The department shall establish by rule the commencement of the period for undertaking the requirements of this paragraph, which period shall begin not later than one (1) year after the completion of the last semester in which a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship was received; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repay all Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship amounts, together with interest which shall begin accruing four (4) years after execution of the agreement. However, interest shall begin to accrue immediately upon the department determining that the student has withdrawn from the Wyoming institution of higher education or is otherwise not making satisfactory academic progress toward completion of a degree or program. Money expended under this section shall accrue at an annual interest rate equal to that charged for federal direct student loans at the time interest begins to accrue, which rate shall be adjusted annually to match the federal direct student loan rate. In no event shall the interest rate be greater than eight percent (8%). Any amounts repaid by Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship recipients shall be deposited to the Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship endowment fund created by W.S. 9-4-204(u)(viii).</p>
                  <p>(f) The Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship expenditure account is created to consist of earnings from the Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship endowment fund created by W.S. 9-4- 204(u)(viii) and such other funds appropriated by the legislature to the expenditure account. No state funds shall be appropriated to the expenditure account or used for scholarships under this section. The monies deposited to the expenditure account under this subsection shall be available for scholarships under this section. Monies within the expenditure account are continuously appropriated to the state treasurer for distribution to eligible institutions based on scholarships awarded under this section. All unexpended and unencumbered monies within the expenditure account at the end of each fiscal year shall be deposited by the state treasurer to the Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship endowment fund.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state treasurer shall administer the university academic facilities challenge account established under this article. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent that funds are available in the challenge account, the state treasurer shall match each qualifying contribution actually received by the University of Wyoming foundation by transferring from the challenge account to the university an amount equal to the amount of the qualifying contribution. Qualifying contributions made directly to the university shall be considered qualifying contributions to the foundation for purposes of this article. The university shall expend both the qualifying contributions and the matching funds solely for the cost of establishing new or renovating existing university academic facilities as approved by the university president and board of trustees for which private fundraising is deemed to be feasible. Authorized expenditures for academic facilities include but are not limited to all expenditures necessary for planning, designing, procuring contractors, construction management and actual construction;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The state treasurer shall make transfers to the university under this section not later than the end of the calendar quarter following the quarter during which the qualifying contribution is received. Matching funds shall only be available for expenditure to the extent cash or cash equivalent contributions are actually received by the University of Wyoming. If a qualifying contribution is made through a series of payments or transfers, no matching funds shall be transferred by the state treasurer until the total value of all payments or transfers actually received toward the contribution totals at least twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). Thereafter, matching funds shall be transferred as payments or transfers toward that qualifying contribution are received by the foundation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The state treasurer shall distribute funds or encumber funds for future distribution in the case of a written commitment, to match a qualifying contribution based on the order in which each qualifying contribution is actually received or in which a written commitment to make a qualifying contribution is received by the foundation. Matching funds shall not be distributed or encumbered in excess of the amount within the challenge account. No matching funds shall be transferred to the university except to match qualifying contributions actually received. The state treasurer shall rescind an encumbrance if the university notifies him that a donor who made a commitment will not make a qualifying contribution that is eligible for matching funds under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For the purpose of calculating the matching amount only, the state treasurer shall use the value of a qualifying contribution based on its fair market value at the time the contribution is received by the university foundation. The university shall provide evidence of fair market value as the state treasurer requires for each qualifying contribution. The state treasurer's office shall not bear any costs associated with providing evidence;</p>
                  <p>(v) The University of Wyoming shall on or before October 1 of each calendar year submit a report to the state treasurer from the university foundation regarding the matching program established under this section for the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include a financial summary and a review of the accomplishments resulting from program expenditures. The state treasurer shall distribute the report to the governor and the joint education interim committee.</p>

If the surviving dependent first enrolls in a community college and then transfers to another community college or the University of Wyoming, the free tuition and fees shall continue until the dependent has completed a cumulative total of ten (10) semesters at the community college level and the university.</p>
                  <p>(b) In order to qualify for the benefit under this section, a person claiming eligibility for free tuition and fees under this section shall be under twenty-two (22) years of age at the time of the death of the parent or legal guardian described in subsection (g) of this section or at the time of the qualifying disability described in subsection (j) of this section, and at the time of first enrollment claiming eligibility for benefits under this section. No person shall be eligible for the benefits provided under this section for any semester commencing more than eight (8) academic years after the semester in which the person initially receives benefits under this section. The institution in which the student enrolls shall grant exceptions to the requirements of this subsection for military service, religious service or other good cause shown, which exceptions shall be consistent with rules promulgated by the Wyoming department of education for the Hathaway scholarship program under W.S. 21-16-1303(b)(iii)(B) and (d).</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon application by a person claiming eligibility for free tuition and fees under this section because of the death or qualifying disability of a parent or legal guardian, the University of Wyoming or the Wyoming community college where the person applied for enrollment shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Determine whether the deceased or disabled person was an individual specified in subsection (g) or (h) of this section;</p>

                  <p>(d) A person who had qualified for free tuition and fees under subsection (b) of this section, shall be deemed eligible for the free tuition and fees at any Wyoming community college or the University of Wyoming up to the maximum number of semesters of study allowed under subsection (a) of this section, if the person transfers to another institution specified in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) For purposes of paragraph (c)(ii) of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed that the decedent died while acting within the scope of duties if death benefits were paid as a result of the death to any person pursuant to the Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act.</p>

                  <p>(i) A peace officer who has qualified pursuant to W.S. 9-1-701 through 9-1-709 and who died while acting within the scope of his duties in the service of a law enforcement agency in the state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A paid or volunteer fire fighter who died while acting within the scope of his duties in the service of a paid or volunteer fire department or district in the state;</p>

                  <p>(h) The benefits provided in subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall be provided to the dependents of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) A peace officer who has qualified pursuant to W.S. 9-1-701 through 9-1-709 and who suffered a qualifying disability while acting within the scope of his duties in the service of a law enforcement agency in the state;</p>

For purposes of subsection (h) of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed that the person suffered a qualifying disability if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person's disability was caused by a specific injury or disease which results primarily from a specific act or occurrence determinable by a definite time or place, from a physical or mental trauma which arises from the nature and in the course of the person's scope of employment;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-16-1603. University reclamation and restoration challenge account matching program; matching payments; conditions; annual reports; reversion of appropriations.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The university shall administer the university reclamation and restoration challenge account established under this article. The following shall apply to the administration of the challenge account:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent that funds are available in the challenge account, the university shall match each qualifying contribution actually received by the University of Wyoming foundation by authorizing expenditures from the challenge account in an amount equal to the amount of the qualifying contribution. Qualifying contributions made directly to the university shall be considered qualifying contributions to the foundation for purposes of this article. The university shall expend both the qualifying contributions and the matching funds solely for the Wyoming reclamation and restoration center. Any investment earnings credited to the account shall be separately accounted for and may be expended by the university to support the center without a qualifying contribution. To the greatest extent practicable, expenditures for the center shall be made for energy related reclamation projects so that qualifying contributions and matching funds support the work of the center through June 30, 2019. All grants shall be subject to the approval and oversight of an ad hoc committee of industry company representatives appointed by the dean of agriculture;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a qualifying contribution is made through a series of payments or transfers, no matching funds shall be authorized for expenditure from the challenge account until the total value of all payments or transfers actually received toward the contribution totals at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). Thereafter, matching funds shall be authorized for expenditure as payments or transfers toward that qualifying contribution are received by the foundation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The university shall authorize matching funds for expenditure, or encumber funds for future authorization in the case of a written commitment, to match a qualifying contribution based on the order in which each qualifying contribution is actually received or in which a written commitment to make a qualifying contribution is received by the foundation. Matching funds shall not be authorized for expenditure or encumbered in excess of the amount within the challenge account. The university shall rescind an encumbrance if a donor who made a commitment will not make a qualifying contribution that is eligible for matching funds under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For the purpose of calculating the matching amount only, the university shall use the value of a qualifying contribution based on its fair market value at the time the contribution is received by the university foundation;</p>
                  <p>(v) The university shall on or before October 1 of each calendar year submit a report to the governor, joint appropriations interim committee and the joint education interim committee from the university foundation regarding the matching program established under this section for the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include a financial summary and a review of the accomplishments resulting from expenditures.</p>

                  <p>(v) At the time of enrollment and in accordance with requirements of the enrolling institution, the person, his spouse or any child of that person submits to the university or community college a notarized affidavit attesting to the requirements of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) An applicant for resident tuition who is a veteran, eligible individual or covered individual as described in 38 U.S.C. 3679(c)(2), shall qualify as a resident for purposes of tuition at the University of Wyoming or Wyoming community college if the applicant provides:</p>
                  <p>(i) A certificate or other evidence of the veteran's or uniformed service member's qualifying service in the uniformed services of the United States;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Documented evidence before or at the time of enrollment that:</p>

                  <p>(B) The veteran was discharged or released from a qualifying period of service in the active military, naval or air service before the date of enrollment or the uniformed service member is currently on active duty;</p>
                  <p>(C) The applicant is a veteran, eligible individual or covered individual as described in 38 U.S.C. 3679(c)(2).</p>
                  <p>(f) For purposes of subsection (e) of this section, "uniformed services of the United States" means service in the United States army, navy, air force, marine corps, coast guard, United States public health service commissioned corps, national oceanic and atmospheric administration commissioned corps, national guard or any reserve or auxiliary component thereof.</p>
                  <p>(g) A person who has qualified for resident tuition under subsection (e) of this section shall remain qualified in subsequent years if the person pursues one (1) or more courses of education while remaining continuously enrolled, other than during regularly scheduled breaks, lives in the state during the term of enrollment and, if the person is eligible through a transfer of eligibility pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3319, the transfer has not been validly revoked. A spouse or child of a uniformed service member who is eligible for resident tuition under subsection (e) of this section at the time of admittance to the University of Wyoming or a Wyoming community college shall not lose eligibility for resident tuition before the time of enrollment at the university or college because the uniformed service member is transferred on military orders outside of this state.</p>
                  <p>(h) Trustees shall through regulation provide that students receiving a Hathaway expand Wyoming scholarship in any amount shall qualify for resident tuition at the university each semester the student receives the scholarship.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to other powers granted to the trustees of the University of Wyoming, the board may offer and provide at other institutions, universities or colleges, a course of training and education in the field of dentistry.</p>
                  <p>(b) To accomplish the purposes of this section, the board of trustees may enter into contracts with other institutions, universities or colleges outside the state that maintain schools for the training and education of students in dentistry and to expend funds appropriated for this purpose in connection therewith.</p>
                  <p>(c) In entering into contracts with institutions, the board of trustees shall give preference to institutions that agree to provide students with a training rotation or externship in Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(d) Students desiring to avail themselves of the opportunities under this section, before enrolling for such courses and having completed the admissions process into the dental education program at a school of dentistry with which the university has an agreement under subsection (a) of this section, must be approved by the president of the university acting with the advice of the state board of dentistry. No student shall be approved by the president unless the student or the student's father, mother or lawful guardian are residents of Wyoming and have been residents for not less than five (5) years immediately prior thereto.</p>
                  <p>(e) In addition to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, before expending any funds the board of trustees shall obtain an agreement from each student whereby the student agrees to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Authorize the state of Wyoming to pay all or a portion of cost of attendance incurred in his dentistry education as determined by any contract between the state of Wyoming and the school of dentistry providing that education: and</p>
                  <p>(A) Actively engage in professional practice or other professional pursuits in dentistry in Wyoming for a period of three (3) years; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Repay all amounts expended by the state of Wyoming under this paragraph on the student's education, together with interest which shall begin accruing after the student's graduation, but in no event later than five (5) years after the student enters into an agreement, upon terms specified by the board. However, interest shall begin to accrue if the board finds that the student has withdrawn from the school of dentistry or is otherwise not making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree or program. Money expended under this paragraph shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to that charged for federal Stafford loans at the time interest begins to accrue, which rate shall be adjusted annually to match the federal Stafford loan rate. In no event shall the interest rate be greater than eight percent (8%).</p>
                  <p>(ii) During the time required to practice under subparagraph (i)(A) of this subsection, treat under terms and conditions specified in the agreement Wyoming patients eligible for services under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act or the child and parent health insurance program pursuant to Wyoming Statutes title 35, chapter 25. All contract provisions established under this paragraph shall be developed in consultation with the state board of dentistry and the department of health.</p>
                  <p>(f) Upon recommendation of the president of the university, the board of trustees may relieve a student of the obligation to repay amounts expended under paragraph (d)(i) of this section, in whole or in part, where repayment would cause undue hardship. The university shall annually report the number of students relieved from repayment under this subsection to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee not later than October 1.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any amounts other than fees and tuition payments, paid by dentistry students in accordance with the contractual arrangements authorized under this section shall be deposited into a special account designated the Dentistry School Student Account, maintained and separately accounted for by the University of Wyoming, which account may be added to by specific contributions from other sources. The account may be invested, at the discretion of the president of the University of Wyoming, for the production of income. The investment income shall be expended by the University of Wyoming solely for direct assistance for relocation costs associated with practice in Wyoming, fees and materials for dental board examinations, rural training, dislocation, student development and scholarships to dentistry students as authorized by the president of the University of Wyoming and the dean of the college of health sciences. The principal of the fund established shall remain unimpaired and only the income derived therefrom may be collected and expended from year to year. The amount of income expended annually pursuant to this section shall not exceed an amount equal to four percent (4%) of the previous five (5) year average market value of the account, calculated from the first day of the fiscal year. Any unexpended income shall remain in the fund. On or before October 1 of each year, the university shall submit a report to the joint appropriations committee and the joint labor, health and social services interim committee on income to the fund and expenditures from fund earnings during the prior fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>(h) Tuition and fees received by the University of Wyoming from students participating in the program under this section, shall be separately accounted for by the university. These funds are to be used by the university solely for the support of education and training conducted at the university pursuant to this section and other graduate courses in the college of health sciences. The receipt and expenditure of these funds shall be identified in the university's biennial budget request.</p>

The securities shall not constitute an indebtedness or a debt within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision or limitation, if any limitation appertains thereto. The bonds or other securities shall not be considered or held to be general obligations of the board but shall constitute its special obligations and the board shall not pledge its full faith and credit for payment of the bonds or securities.</p>

                  <p>(c) Before any securities are actually issued payable from any net pledged revenues, except for any securities issued solely for the purpose of funding or refunding or both funding and refunding outstanding securities, any net pledged revenues for the next preceding twelve (12) months, for the next preceding calendar year, or for the next preceding fiscal year, as defined and otherwise determined by the board, shall be sufficient to pay an amount representing one hundred ten percent (110%) of the combined maximum annual principal and interest requirements to be paid during the twelve (12) months, calendar year or fiscal year of any outstanding securities payable from and constituting a lien upon the net pledged revenues and the securities proposed to be issued excluding any reserves therefor except as otherwise expressly provided in this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) In any determination of whether or not any proposed securities meet the earnings test limiting their issuance as provided in subsection (c) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) There shall be deducted from or added to any gross pledged revenues any estimated decrease or increase in the revenues resulting from any decreased or increased or additional fees, rates or charges fixed by the board, whether or not appertaining to any additional facilities for which the proposed securities are authorized to be issued; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) There shall be deducted from or added to any operation and maintenance expenses any estimated decrease or increase in the expenses, whether or not resulting from any additional facilities for which the proposed securities are authorized to be issued.</p>
                  <p>(e) The respective annual principal and interest requirements including as an interest requirement the amount of any prior redemption premiums due on any prior redemption date as of which any outstanding securities have been called or have been ordered by the board to be called for prior redemption shall be reduced to the extent the requirements are scheduled to be paid with any monies held in trust or escrow for that purpose in any trust bank subject to any limitations appertaining thereto in section 7, article 15, Wyoming constitution, including without limitation the known minimum yield from any investment or reinvestment of the money under W.S. 21-17-426.</p>

                  <p>(d) and (e) of this section and the calculations required by subsection (c) of this section shall be made by the treasurer of the university which shall be conclusively presumed to be accurate. This section does not prohibit the issuance of securities merely because there were no pledged revenues nor operation and maintenance expenses, in the absence of such adjustments, in the next preceding twelve (12) months, calendar year, or fiscal year, as the case may be.</p>
                  <p>(g) This section does not prevent the board from providing an earnings test in any resolution authorizing the issuance of securities or in any other proceedings appertaining thereto which test limits the issuance of any additional securities.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, the University of Wyoming board of trustees is authorized to acquire the facility housing the national center for atmospheric research supercomputer center constructed and operated in accordance with the memorandum of understanding and final contract entered into pursuant to 2007 Wyoming Session Laws, Chapter 136, Section 336. The acquisition may be made by:</p>
                  <p>(i) Pursuant to subsection (b) of this section notwithstanding W.S. 21-17-408(b), pledging and, as required, using federal mineral royalties distributed to the university pursuant to W.S. 9-4-601(a)(iv) to fund the principal amount and accrued interest remaining to be paid on industrial development revenue bonds issued by Laramie County, Wyoming, and purchased by the state treasurer to fund the construction of the center facility; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the issuance of revenue bonds under the University Securities Law, W.S. 21-17-402 through 21-17-450.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any action taken by the board pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) of this section shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) All final agreements have been executed for construction and operation of the center as required in 2007 Wyoming Session Laws, Chapter 136, Section 336(d);</p>
                  <p>(ii) The final agreements in paragraph (i) of this subsection include binding provisions as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) If the national science foundation ceases to fund the center on or after July 1, 2019, the national center for atmospheric research shall provide written notice to the University of Wyoming at least one (1) year in advance of the date upon which funding will cease;</p>
                  <p>(B) If the national science foundation ceases to fund the center as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the university consortium for atmospheric research, which is the parent organization for the national center for atmospheric research, shall transfer ownership of all its interest in the center to the University of Wyoming so that the university holds one hundred percent (100%) ownership interest in the center facility.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the national science foundation ceases to fund the center as provided in subparagraph (b)(ii)(A) of this section, to the extent the board of trustees determines that the issuance of revenue bonds under the University Securities Law may more economically or otherwise better accomplish the purposes of this section, and no other source of revenue other than the pledge under paragraph (a)(i) of this section has been committed to meet the repayment obligations required by the industrial development revenue bonds, the board may issue its revenue bonds to repay the industrial development revenue bonds if the state treasurer still owns them.</p>
                  <p>(d) The university shall report any notification from the national center for atmospheric research under subparagraph (b)(ii)(A) of this section to the governor, state treasurer, joint appropriations interim committee and joint minerals, business and economic development interim committee of the legislature.</p>

A request for an enrollment adjustment to the standard budget for state aid to community colleges shall be submitted every four (4) years commencing in the fiscal biennium beginning July 1, 2018. The enrollment adjustment shall be based solely upon the calculation under subsection (e) of this section. The budget requests shall be made upon forms and in a format to be determined by the budget division of the department of administration and information.</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed By Laws 2000, Ch. 33, § 2.</p>

An enrollment adjustment request for a percentage increase or decrease to a standard budget base amount for annual weighted average enrollment shall be calculated as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The variable cost percentage determined pursuant to W.S. 21-18-205(c) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference in the annual weighted average enrollment for the three (3) most recent academic years and the annual weighted average enrollment at the time of last enrollment adjustment request submitted pursuant to this subsection, the denominator of which is the annual weighted average enrollment at the time of the last enrollment adjustment request submitted pursuant to this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The standard budget enrollment adjustment request submitted for the fiscal biennium commencing July 1, 2018 shall apply the formula in paragraph (i) of this subsection, with the substitution of annual weighted average enrollment for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 in lieu of the "annual weighted average enrollment at the time of the last enrollment adjustment request submitted pursuant to this subsection";</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any funding increase or decrease as determined by the state legislature shall be distributed in proportion to the funding amounts determined in W.S. 21-18-205(c).</p>

                  <p>(a) As part of its administrative functions, the community college commission shall identify community college building needs and develop a prioritized list of community college capital construction projects. The prioritized community college capital construction projects shall be reported by the commission to the state construction department in accordance with subsection (g) of this section. Following review, analysis and study, the state construction department shall forward recommendations for community college capital construction projects to the state building commission. The state construction department shall also submit major maintenance budget requests for college buildings to the legislature in accordance with this section. Major maintenance budget requests shall be based upon the square footage submitted by the commission under subsection (f) of this section and upon a formula adopted by the state building commission, and upon forms and in a format specified by the budget division of the department of administration and information. College building maintenance budget requests submitted by the state construction department to the legislature and capital construction budget requests forwarded by the state building commission to the legislature shall include only necessary building square footage:</p>
                  <p>(i) Required for provision of those education programs comprising the statewide college system strategic plan developed and maintained under W.S. 21-18-202(a)(v); and</p>
                  <p>(ii) For major maintenance, exclude student housing, student unions and auxiliary services areas funded exclusively through college generated revenues.</p>
                  <p>(b) To carry out this section and in accordance with rules and regulations of the state building commission promulgated under W.S. 9-5-107(d) and (e) serving as guidelines for implementation and administration of this section, the commission shall establish and maintain:</p>
                  <p>(i) A statewide community college building data base comprised of building inventory, specific building condition, square footage, usage, space utilization and building capacity data;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Statewide planning and reporting criteria and guidelines for use by community college districts in developing and maintaining comprehensive long-range plans for district building needs as required under W.S. 21-18-304(a)(xi), providing necessary guidance to college districts for separating future building space needs and requests attached to the statewide college system strategic plan from other district space requests;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Methodologies for use by community college districts in computing future student enrollments, building space demands and future building needs in establishing long- range plans addressing district building needs;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Methodologies which require a seven (7) year phase-in period for major maintenance following the new construction of a community college facility. The phase-in period shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Year one (1) - zero percent (0%);</p>
                  <p>(B) Year two (2) - ten percent (10%);</p>
                  <p>(C) Year three (3) - ten percent (10%);</p>
                  <p>(D) Year four (4) - forty percent (40%);</p>
                  <p>(E) Year five (5) - sixty percent (60%);</p>
                  <p>(F) Year six (6) - eighty percent (80%);</p>
                  <p>(G) Year seven (7) and thereafter - one hundred percent (100%).</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall conduct and maintain a comprehensive assessment of community college buildings and future space requirements as defined by the statewide strategic plan. The comprehensive building assessment shall be designed and maintained to provide timely and uniform statewide data on building condition and building longevity and future space requirements. The needs assessment shall be revised annually to reflect current conditions and shall be capable of providing data sufficient to accommodate a five (5) year planning cycle.</p>
                  <p>(d) On or before November 1 of each year, the commission shall, based upon the assessment performed under subsection (c) of this section and upon facility plans and annual reports submitted by each college pursuant to W.S. 21-18-304(a)(xi), prioritize community college construction needs for the current fiscal year and the succeeding four (4) fiscal years based upon:</p>
                  <p>(i) Criteria for statewide capacity for education programs aligned to the statewide college system strategic plan;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Analysis of student enrollment changes based upon commission approved enrollment projection methodology, to determine the need for changes in statewide building capacities over time for delivering statewide education program needs identified within the strategic plan;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A methodology and process established by the commission for identifying the most critical building needs.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commission may modify construction needs prioritized under subsection (d) of this section in any subsequent fiscal year as necessary to address statewide needs as substantiated by data, condition assessments, needs analysis and other information assembled by the commission under this section. Needs receiving a lower priority than previously assigned may be removed or reprioritized by the commission. Construction needs modified under this subsection shall be reported to the state construction department.</p>
                  <p>(f) In addition to subsection (d) of this section and on or before June 1 of each odd-numbered year, the commission shall report college building square footage to the state construction department as necessary for computation of major maintenance funds for community college buildings. The reported square footage shall be restricted to that square footage necessary for the delivery of education programs comprising the statewide college system strategic plan and exclude student housing, student unions and auxiliary services areas funded exclusively through college generated revenues.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon prioritizing community college construction needs under subsection (d) of this section, the commission shall not later than June 1 of each year, report the prioritized list to the state construction department. In accordance with W.S. 9-5-108(a)(ii), the state construction department shall review, analyze and study construction needs prioritized under subsection (d) of this section and conduct necessary value engineering analysis, schematic design review, safety and security assessments and other analysis and review prior to submission of recommendations to the state building commission. The state building commission shall consider and incorporate prioritized construction needs recommendations into legislation requesting necessary funding, developed under W.S. 9-5-108(a)(ii)(J), for submission to the legislature for review, authorization and approval. The legislation shall also include a separate appropriation for contingency costs associated with recommended construction projects and a separate appropriation for administrative costs of the state construction department for management of the recommended construction projects as required by subsection (j) of this section. The state construction department shall submit a separate budget request for project design and planning funds to be available to assist community colleges with costs incurred in developing and providing necessary plans, designs and other information to the state construction department for purposes of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>This request shall also include funds for major maintenance for the square footage reported by the commission under subsection</p>
                  <p>(f) of this section. The state construction department shall consult with the community college commission in developing recommendations under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(h) The community college commission shall provide copies of the needs assessment, construction priorities and major maintenance square footage established under this section to members of the legislature on or before December 1 of each year.</p>
                  <p>(j) Subject to amounts made available by legislative appropriation and to any conditions which may be attached to appropriation expenditures, the state construction department shall distribute state funds for building construction approved and authorized by the legislature. Distributions of state funds for any approved and authorized construction project shall be in accordance with payment schedules established by rule and regulation of the department. Payments by the department shall be contingent upon the receipt of any local district funding as may be required by legislative authorization, or upon receipt of other documentation which may be required by the program certifying the timely receipt of required local district funds for the capital construction project. Payments to districts shall also be attached to prescribed phases of the construction project and the completion of certain project phases.</p>
                  <p>Construction phases for which approval of the program is required shall be specified by the state construction department rule and regulation, clearly prescribing a process for program review and approval of project plans and specifications, project development and project changes and change orders. In carrying out duties under this subsection, the department may execute powers prescribed under W.S. 9-5-108(a)(iii) in coordination with the state building commission and the appropriate community college district. No scheduled payment shall be made by the department without compliance with the prescribed process.</p>
                  <p>(k) Appropriations for major maintenance shall be distributed by the state construction department to community colleges in equal quarterly installments in amounts determined by the funding formula developed by the state building commission, subject to restrictions imposed on qualifying square footage pursuant to this section. The state construction department shall distribute the first quarterly payment on July 1 of each fiscal year, with the remaining payments distributed on October 1, January 2 and April 1.</p>
                  <p>(m) Notwithstanding any provision of law enacted prior to January 1, 2014, biennial budget requests submitted for major maintenance funding for community college capital construction facilities authorized by the legislature shall be calculated as provided in this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) Established community college districts may be enlarged by annexing additional counties as provided in this section. A county may be annexed under this section to an existing community college district with which it is contiguous or any other community college district approved by the community college commission.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon receipt of a petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the qualified electors residing within the county sought to be annexed requesting that the county be annexed to the community college district or upon receipt of a resolution calling for annexation by the board of county commissioners of the county sought to be annexed, the community college district board shall within ten (10) days following receipt, approve or deny the petition or resolution. If approved, the district board shall request an election to be held in the county seeking annexation in accordance with the dates and procedures provided by W.S. 22-21-103 through 22-21-110. The number of electors required for a petition shall be determined by the number of votes cast at the last general election.</p>

                  <p>Annexation and mill levy YES</p>

                  <p>(e) Only qualified voters residing within the county to be annexed shall be allowed to vote in the election.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the annexation is approved by the voters of the county to be annexed:</p>
                  <p>(i) The county clerk shall immediately notify the county commissioners and the county commissioners shall levy the special mill tax in the manner provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The community college district board shall immediately and by resolution partition the enlarged district into election subdistricts to provide for board representation based upon population and shall designate the number of board members to be elected from each subdistrict in accordance with the population of the enlarged district and the respective election subdistricts. In accordance with W.S. 21-18-308(a), the board of the enlarged district shall be comprised of not more than seven (7) members;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An election of members of the board of trustees of the enlarged community college district shall be held as determined by the board of county commissioners, on a date which is not less than sixty (60) days following the date annexation is approved based upon the apportionment by the board under paragraph (f)(ii) of this section.

                  <p>(i) The county clerk shall immediately notify the county commissioners and the special mill levy imposed upon the assessed value of the county for the operation and maintenance of the community college shall terminate effective the end of that calendar year.

                  <p><shortTitle>21-18-313. Bond issues; revenue bonds.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The community college district board of any community college having a daytime enrollment of at least two hundred (200) students may issue negotiable coupon bonds of the community college for the purpose of acquiring, erecting, and equipping student dormitories, dining halls, and recreational facilities, and acquiring sites therefor.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided bonds shall be payable solely out of a special fund to contain the net revenues to be derived from the operation of the dormitories, dining halls, and recreational facilities, the revenues being defined as those remaining after paying the cost of maintaining and operating the facilities. Bonds shall contain an irrevocable pledge of and lien on net revenues and are not general obligations of the districts issuing the bonds within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provisions, and the face of each bond issued shall so state. Bonds shall not be secured by mortgage on property but the net income on such property may be pledged for the payment of principal and interest thereon. The governing board of said community college district may, by resolution, pledge and pay into the special fund any or all of the revenue of the district, excluding the revenue derived from ad valorem taxes and student fees paid as tuition, and including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all other fees, rates, and charges in any manner derived from the operation of the college district to the extent necessary to provide for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds authorized to be issued.</p>
                  <p>(c) Bonds shall be authorized by a resolution adopted by the community college district board, shall mature serially within a period not exceeding forty (40) years from their date and shall bear interest payable annually or semiannually. The resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds shall provide the details thereof, including provisions for their disposition, payment and redemption. The resolution shall provide for the accumulation of net revenue for a reserve fund of not less than seven percent (7%) of bond proceeds in addition to any amounts accumulated under subsection (e) of this section, for the maintenance and repair and for facility obsolescence and depreciation of any building or facility to be constructed or otherwise acquired through the bond issue, and it shall contain other or further covenants and agreements as may be determined by the governing board for the protection of bondholders.</p>
                  <p>(d) Before issuing any revenue bonds, the governing board shall by resolution declare the purpose for which the proceeds of the bonds proposed to be issued shall be expended and shall specify the maximum amount of bonds to be issued or sold for that purpose. The governing board may not issue or sell bonds in an amount exceeding the specified maximum amount except with the consent of the bondholders and by amendment or modification of the indenture. The governing board may amend the resolution prior to the issuance of the bonds authorized thereby to increase or decrease the maximum amount of bonds to be issued or sold. The governing board may include in a single resolution or authorization the issuance of bonds for one (1) or more projects.</p>
                  <p>(e) The governing board of a community college district shall establish and collect charges and rentals for services and facilities furnished, acquired, constructed, or purchased from the proceeds of the bonds, sufficient to pay the principal or the interest on the bonds as they become due and payable, together with such additional sums as may be deemed necessary for accumulating a reserve pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, providing for obsolescence and depreciation and paying the expenses of operating and maintaining the facilities. The governing board shall establish all other charges, fees and rates to be derived from the operation of the facilities.</p>
                  <p>(f) The governing board of a community college district may insure against the loss of revenues from any cause. The proceeds of the insurance shall be used exclusively for the payment of bonds and the interest thereon. If loss of revenue is brought about as a result of the destruction of one (1) or more of the facilities constructed, acquired, or purchased from the proceeds of the bonds, then and in that event the proceeds of insurance may be used for the replacement of the facilities.</p>
                  <p>(g) The governing board of a community college district may enter into agreements and contracts with the United States government and any of its agencies for the construction and operation of facilities and revenue bonds to be issued therefor. The governing board of the community college may comply with conditions that the federal government may impose to secure the full benefits of federal statutes pertaining to loans or grants to educational institutions for housing and other facilities, all other provisions of this act to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
                  <p>(h) Bonds issued pursuant to this act are eligible for investment by banking institutions and for estate, trust, and fiduciary funds, and the bonds and the interest thereon shall be exempt from taxation by this state and any subdivision thereof. The state treasurer of the state of Wyoming, with the approval of the governor and the attorney general, may invest any permanent state funds available for investment in the bonds to be issued hereunder.</p>
                  <p>(j) The governing board of a community college district has plenary powers and responsibility for the acquisition, construction, and completion of all projects authorized by the governing board by the resolution to issue revenue bonds.</p>
                  <p>(k) The governing board of a community college district may insure such facilities authorized by the governing board against public liability or property damage.</p>
                  <p>(m) The governing board may provide for the replacement of destroyed, lost, or mutilated bonds or coupons.</p>
                  <p>(n) All costs and expenses incident to the issuance and sale of the revenue bonds may be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds. Interest on bonds may be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds during the actual construction of any facilities for which the bonds were issued. Provision for the payment of interest under such circumstances shall be made in the indenture.</p>
                  <p>(o) Revenue bonds may be sold at either public or private sale. The community college district board may establish terms and conditions for the sale or other disposition of an authorized issue of bonds. The board may authorize, by resolution, the sale of bonds at less than their par or face value.</p>
                  <p>(p) The governing board may provide for the execution and authentication of revenue bonds by the manual, lithographed, or printed facsimile signature of officers of the governing board of the community college district if at least one (1) signature shall be manually inscribed.</p>
                  <p>(q) Revenue bonds are callable upon such terms, conditions, and notice as the governing board may determine and upon the payment of such premium as may be fixed by the board in the proceedings for the issuance of the bonds. No bond is subject to call or redemption prior to its fixed maturity date unless the right to exercise the call is expressly stated on the face of the bond.</p>
                  <p>(r) The community college district board may provide for the issuance, sale, or exchange of refunding bonds issued under the provisions authorizing the board to issue revenue bonds. All provisions of this act applicable to the issuance of revenue bonds by community college districts are applicable to the funding or refunding of revenue bonds and to the issuance, sale, or exchange thereof.</p>
                  <p>(s) The governing board of a community college district may issue funding or refunding bonds in a principal amount sufficient to provide funds for the payment of all bonds funded or refunded thereby, and in addition for the payment of all expenses incident to the calling, retiring, or paying of the outstanding bonds, and the issuance of the funding or refunding bonds.</p>
                  <p>(t) Any balance remaining in any fund established to pay the principal and interest on bonds after payment of all charges, costs and expenses authorized to be expended therefrom may be allocated and used for the acquisition, construction, equipping, and furnishing of buildings and sites for community college purposes.</p>
                  <p>(u) The obligation and liability of the community college district board, severally and individually, to the holders of the bonds is limited to applying proceeds of the special fund to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds and the bonds shall contain a provision to that effect. In the event of default in the payment of bonds or the interest thereon, and in the event that the board is misusing special funds or not using them as provided by this act, then the holders, or any of them, may bring suit against the board in the district court of the county wherein the community college is located for the purpose of restraining the board from using the funds for any purpose other than the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds as provided by this act.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>21-18-314. Bond issues; general obligation bonds; bond elections; bond tax levy.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A majority of the community college district board may submit to the electors of the district the question of whether the board shall issue bonds of the district not to exceed four percent (4%) of the assessed valuation of the community college district:</p>
                  <p>(i) For the purchase, erection, remodeling, or completion of a building or buildings for community college purposes and the equipment and suitable site therefor;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For the purchase of equipment and facilities, including laboratories, libraries, and other such facilities as may be deemed necessary and proper for the college;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For fees and costs attendant to the services of attorneys, architects, and engineers, and for the cost of publications, the printing of bonds and prospectus.</p>
                  <p>(b) Bonds may run for a period of twenty-five (25) years or less and bear interest. In addition, not less than seven percent (7%) of the bond proceeds shall be used for the maintenance and repair and for facility obsolescence and depreciation of any building or facility to be constructed or otherwise acquired through the bond issue. The four percent (4%) limitation in subsection (a) of this section shall be separate and apart from and in addition to the ten percent (10%) limitation of indebtedness as provided for by the constitution and laws of Wyoming for school districts. The levy for payment thereof is separate and apart from and in addition to the operating levy of not to exceed four (4) mills, and additional levy imposed under W.S. 21-18-303(b) and any additional operating levy imposed under W.S. 21-18-311(f) of not to exceed five (5) mills, unless the bond election question provides otherwise.</p>
                  <p>(c) An election on the question of the issuance of bonds by a community college district shall be held on the dates and in the manner prescribed in the Political Subdivision Bond Election Law, W.S. 22-21-101 through 22-21-112.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the proposed issue of bonds is approved in the election and issuance thereof is authorized by the community college district board the bonds may be sold at either public or private sale. All costs and expenses incident to the issue and sale of the bonds made may be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds. If the bonds are sold at public sale the community college district board must give at least one (1) notice by publication in some newspaper of general circulation in the community college district, and also in some newspaper published in the capital of this state, of its intention to sell the bonds, briefly describing same, and the time and place where the sale will take place. The publication shall be made not less than fifteen (15) days, nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date designated for the sale of the bonds.</p>
                  <p>(e) After ascertaining the best terms upon, and the lowest interest at which the bonds can be sold, the community college district board shall cause the bonds to be suitably printed or lithographed, with coupons, if any, attached, and thereafter shall have the bonds consecutively numbered and otherwise properly prepared and executed. Bonds may be in such form as the board may direct but must bear the signature of the president of the community college board of trustees, be countersigned by the secretary of the board, bear the district seal and be countersigned by the county treasurer. Bond coupons, if any, must be signed by the president and secretary of the board and by the county treasurer. The secretary of the community college board shall endorse a certificate upon every bond that it is issued pursuant to law and is within the debt limit of the issuer. Bonds shall be registered by the county treasurer in a public book provided for that purpose stating the number, date, amount, time and place of payment, rate of interest, number of coupons attached, if any, for each bond so entered and any other proper description thereof for future identification.</p>
                  <p>(f) Bonds issued by community college districts pursuant to this section shall bear interest payable annually or semiannually, and evidenced by one (1) or two (2) sets of coupons, if any, except that the first coupon may evidence interest for a period not in excess of one (1) year, and the bonds may be in one (1) or more series, may bear a date or dates, may mature in an amount or amounts, serially or otherwise, at a time or times not exceeding twenty-five (25) years from their respective dates, may be in a denomination or denominations, may be payable in a medium of payment, in a place or places, within or without the state, including, but not limited to the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the college is located, may carry such registration privileges, may be subject to terms or prior redemption in advance of maturity in order, or by lot, or otherwise, at a time or times with or without premium, may bear privileges for reissuance in the same or other denominations, may be so reissued without modification of maturities and interest rates and may be in a form, either coupon or registered, as may be provided by resolution of the community college district board. Except as the board may otherwise provide, bonds and interest coupons attached thereto, if any, are fully negotiable, within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, W.S. 34.1-8-101 through 34.1-8-603. A holder of each bond, by accepting the bond, shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that the bond is and shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, W.S. 34.1-8-101 through 34.1-8-603.</p>
                  <p>(g) Whenever the issuance of bonds by a community college district may be lawful, the community college district board having authority to issue said bonds may, at its discretion, divide such issues into series so that substantially equal amounts of the indebtedness shall mature annually, or so that substantially equal tax levies shall be required for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds, or that substantially equal tax payments shall be required for the payment of principal and interest of all outstanding bonds of the district issuing said bonds, the bonds of each such series being made due and payable at a definite date within the period permitted by law for the discharge of such indebtedness.</p>
                  <p>(h) The sale of bonds must be conducted by the community college district board. All proceeds from the sale of bonds shall be paid to the treasury of the county in which the college is located to the credit of the community college district and shall be made immediately available to the community college district upon order of the community college district board. Bonds shall not be sold for less than par value, and the board is authorized to reject any bids. The faith, credit, and all property lying within the community college district are solemnly pledged for the payment of the interest and the redemption of the principal of all bonds issued pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(j) The board of county commissioners shall cause to be levied annually upon all taxable property of the community college district, in addition to other authorized taxes, a sufficient sum to pay the principal and interest on bonds as the payments thereon become due to be levied, assessed, and collected in the same manner as other taxes for school purposes. The tax shall be known as "District bond tax of Community College District" and shall be levied until the principal and interest of the bonds are fully paid. If the tax for the payment of interest on any bonds issued under this act at any time is not levied or collected in time to meet payment, the interest shall be paid out of any monies in the general fund of the district and the monies so used for payment shall be repaid to the fund from which taken out of the first monies collected from district taxes.</p>
                  <p>(k) The county treasurer shall pay out of any monies belonging to the community college district tax fund, the interest upon any bonds issued under this section by the college district when due upon presentation at his office of the proper coupon, which must show the amount due, and the number of the bond to which it belonged. All coupons paid must be reported to the community college district board at its meeting thereafter.</p>
                  <p>(m) If any member of the community college district board fraudulently fails or refuses to pay into the proper county treasury the money arising from the sale of any bonds provided for by this act, he is guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for a term of not less than one (1) year nor more than ten (10) years.</p>
                  <p>(n) The community college district board shall require the county treasurer to give the district a separate bond in such sum as the board deems proper, with two (2) or more sufficient sureties, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties required of him by this section and the faithful accounting for the monies deposited with him and realized from the sale of said bonds, as herein provided for. Bonds shall be approved by the board and shall be and remain in the custody of the district board.</p>
                  <p>(o) The bonds and any coupons bearing the signatures of the officers in office at the time of the signing thereof are valid and binding obligations of the community college district board, notwithstanding that before delivery or payment thereof, any or all of the persons whose signatures or facsimiles appear thereon have ceased to fill their respective offices.</p>
                  <p>(p) Any officer of the board authorized or permitted to sign any bonds, including revenue bonds, refunding bonds, and bonds specified in this section, or interest coupons at the time of its execution, upon the execution and filing of a signature certificate, may execute or cause to be executed with a facsimile signature in lieu of his manual signature any bonds and coupons, if any, issued pursuant to the provisions of this act and may adopt as and for his own signature the facsimile signature of his predecessor in office in the event that the facsimile signature, having been executed by an officer then authorized to do so, appears upon the bonds or coupons.

                  <p>(a) No ownership rights to any electronic writing or other electronic communication created by a student shall be conveyed, transferred or otherwise affected solely as a result of the writing or other communication being stored on an electronic device paid for in whole or in part by a community college within the state or transmitted or stored on a community college's network.</p>
                  <p>(b) Students at a community college in the state shall have an expectation of privacy in the electronic writings and other electronic communications created by the student regardless of whether the writing or other communication is stored on an electronic device paid for in whole or in part by the community college or transmitted or stored on the community college's network.

                  <p>(a) The state loan and investment board may negotiate and make loans from the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund to community college districts for capital construction of student dormitories, including the purchase of land, buildings, facilities and necessary rights-of-way. The aggregate sum of all outstanding loans made under this section shall not exceed sixty million dollars ($60,000,000.00). The board shall adopt rules as it deems advisable or necessary to administer the loans authorized in this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) In making loans authorized in this section, the board shall establish in rule the requirements and standards which it determines to be advisable or necessary and in accordance with the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) To qualify for a loan a community college district shall demonstrate in its application:</p>
                  <p>(A) A commitment to adequately maintain the student dormitory for which the loan is requested for the full term of the loan or for the period in which there remains an outstanding loan balance;</p>
                  <p>(B) That all costs for the construction of the student dormitory will be funded at the time of receipt of the loan, with funding sources specified in the application.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The determination of whether to make a loan shall include consideration of:</p>
                  <p>(A) The community college district's need for the student dormitory and the financial needs of the community college district in relation to the student dormitory;</p>
                  <p>(B) The ability of the community college district to repay the loan.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any community college district with a significant demonstrated need to increase student dormitory capacity on campus shall be granted first priority for loans;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Loans shall be at an interest rate of one percent (1%) plus seventy-five thousandths of one percent (.075%) for each year of the loan term in excess of five (5) years;</p>
                  <p>(v) Loans shall be for an initial term of not fewer than five (5) years and not greater than twenty-five (25) years for repayment;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Adequate security for loans shall be required and may include:</p>
                  <p>(A) A pledge of the revenues from the student dormitory for which the loan was granted;</p>
                  <p>(B) A pledge of other revenues available to the community college district receiving the loan;</p>
                  <p>(C) Any other security device or requirement deemed advantageous or necessary by the board.</p>
                  <p>(vii) Annual financial statements shall be required from any community college district receiving a loan. In addition, the expenditures and progress of the project related to the loan shall be reported to the board at least annually or more frequently if deemed advisable by the board. At the end of the term of the loan, the community college district shall provide to the board a comprehensive report that shall, at minimum, include a financial review and a list of the accomplishments as a result of the loan;</p>
                  <p>(viii) No loan shall be made without the written opinion of the attorney general certifying the legality of the transaction and all documents connected therewith. An election by the qualified electors of the community college district approving the construction of student dormitories and borrowing of funds under this section shall be required only if the attorney general determines an election is otherwise required by law;</p>
                  <p>(ix) A loan origination fee of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the loan amount shall be paid by the community college district to the board to be credited to a loss reserve account, which is hereby created:</p>
                  <p>(A) Revenues received by the board for deposit in the loss reserve account shall be transmitted to the state treasurer for deposit to the account;</p>
                  <p>(B) Funds in the loss reserve account shall be used to pay the administrative and legal expenses of the board in making collections and foreclosing on loans made pursuant to this section;</p>
                  <p>(C) If, as a result of default in the payment of any loan made under this section there occurs a nonrecoverable loss either to the corpus of, or interest due to the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, the board shall restore the loss to the fund using any funds available in the loss reserve account. If the funds in the loss reserve account are insufficient to restore the full amount of the loss, the board shall submit a detailed report of the loss to the legislature and shall request an appropriation to restore the balance of the loss to the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund.</p>
                  <p>(x) The board, whenever it deems necessary for the better protection of the permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, may refinance any delinquent loan made under this section and reamortize the loan over not more than twenty-five (25) years from the date of refinancing. All costs of refinancing the loan shall be paid by the community college district that is delinquent on the original loan and no loan shall be refinanced where it appears refinancing will jeopardize the collection of the loan. A fee of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the refinanced loan amount shall be paid by the community college district to the board to be credited to a loss reserve account created by paragraph (ix) of this subsection. The rate of interest for any refinanced loan shall be at the same rate specified under paragraph (iv) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) Loans to a community college district under this section shall not be used for any other infrastructure need of the community college district that is not directly associated with the development and construction of student dormitories.</p>
                  <p>(d) On or before June 30 of each year, the board shall report information on the administration of loans made pursuant to this section to the joint appropriations committee, the joint minerals, business and economic development interim committee and the joint education interim committee. The report shall include a list of all loan requests made in the previous twelve (12) months, the amount approved by project, expenditures by project and the progress of each project as of the date of the report, including outstanding loan amounts, repayment schedules and any delinquencies.</p>

                  <p>(vii) For students attending more than one (1) community college the commission may distribute any student grant funds provided on a proportionate basis as determined by rule of the commission;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Following each spring semester, each college shall refund to the commission the difference, if any, between the amounts distributed to colleges for student grants under this section for the spring term and the previous fall and summer terms and the amount actually expended by colleges on those student grants. Colleges shall refund the difference not later than August 1. The commission shall deposit all payments under this paragraph to the Wyoming works student grant account.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission, in consultation with each community college, shall by rule designate a date or dates for each academic year upon which each college shall make the final computation for unmet need for students eligible to receive a grant under this section, consistent with each college's schedule for determining actual cost of attendance for students at that college.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall, in consultation with community college admissions officers and financial aid officers, promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement student grant provisions under this article, including:</p>

                  <p>(a) From monies within the Wyoming works program account the commission shall distribute to colleges funds for instructor positions and to acquire instructional and resource materials and classroom equipment necessary to support the Wyoming works program. The community colleges may collaborate on the use of funds received from the Wyoming works program account, including entering into consortium agreements for operation of credential programs.</p>
                  <p>(b) Funds distributed under this section shall be subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The funds shall be designated as Wyoming works program funding, accounted for separately from funding provided under the allocation model under W.S. 21-18-205(c) and special purpose funding under W.S. 21-18-205(e) and shall not be transferred to or expended for any other purpose;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The funds shall be expended only for credential programs approved by the commission. The commission shall develop by rule criteria under which to approve credential programs and to determine the amount of funding provided. The process for approving programs for funding shall reflect the primary goals of the Wyoming works program to develop technical skills most in demand in a college's service area or colleges' combined service areas and to fund programs which are most able to immediately respond to that demand by making grant funds available to students able to acquire the credential needed. The criteria for funding amounts shall include, at a minimum, the need for the program in the community, the region's workforce needs and the contribution of the program to the state's overall economic development. Priority shall be given to programs developed and delivered through consortiums and partnerships of colleges, to those programs which, based upon enrollment and projected enrollment, are most able to respond to industry training needs in the community and region. Colleges shall make application for funding of credential programs to the commission at times determined by rule of the commission;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Funds shall only be distributed if matched in the ratio of two dollars ($2.00) of Wyoming works program account funds to not less than one dollar ($1.00) of matching nonstate funds. The commission shall distribute matching funds at the time any accumulated matching funds actually received by or pledged to the community college or consortium of community colleges total ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more. Matching nonstate funds under this paragraph include but are not limited to the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) Cash or cash equivalents;</p>
                  <p>(B) The fair market value, as determined by the commission, of in-kind donations of facilities, equipment or services to support approved credential programs, including donations actually received prior to the effective date of this section but after June 30, 2018.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any amount of funding distributed under this section which remains unexpended or unencumbered at the end of the biennial budget period for which it was distributed shall revert to the Wyoming works program account.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the governing body of any lawfully established community college or of the University of Wyoming may establish and administer a retirement plan for the benefit of certain employees of its institution by the use of a portion of the employer and employee contributions required under the provisions of the Wyoming Retirement Act.</p>
                <p>(b) Except for participation on and after January 1, 1994, pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, any employee who is initially employed by an institution after June 30, 1985, shall elect to participate in either the institution's retirement plan or the Wyoming retirement system but shall not participate in any manner in both retirement plans.</p>
                <p>(c) Prior to January 1, 1994, any employee participating in a retirement plan pursuant to this chapter but who is not a member of the Wyoming retirement system, by written notice to his employer, may elect to discontinue participation under the institution's plan and become a member of the Wyoming retirement system, or if an employee is participating in the Wyoming retirement system as a limited member, he may elect to transfer his limited contributions and matching employer contributions, plus regular interest, from the Wyoming retirement system to one (1) of the plans authorized by this section.</p>
                <p>(d) Prior to January 1, 1994, any employee of an institution shall elect to participate in either the retirement plan offered by the employing institution or the Wyoming retirement system. Each employee shall prior to January 1, 1994, provide written notice to the employing institution and the Wyoming retirement board of his election under this subsection. If an employee fails to notify the employing institution which retirement plan he selects, the institution shall notify the retirement board of this omission and the retirement board shall serve notice on the employee by registered mail return receipt requested that participation in the retirement system shall be cancelled effective January 1, 1994. All retirement contributions made on and after January 1, 1994 by any employee, together with matching employer contributions on his behalf, shall be made to the elected plan.

                  <p>(a) If two (2) or more boards of trustees desire to establish a board of cooperative services for the purpose of providing cooperative educational services and if the services can be provided more effectively through a cooperative effort, the boards of trustees of the interested districts, a majority of whose members respectively vote in favor of doing so, may enter into an agreement to form a board of cooperative educational services. The agreement shall specify among other things the length of term of the agreement, the rights, responsibilities and obligations of each participating district, the types of services to be rendered, the procedure for the establishment of additional services and the procedure for the inclusion of additional districts within the cooperative educational services program. The agreement shall also provide a method for the amendment and dissolution of the agreement with the consent of each participating district. Any agreement to form a board of cooperative educational services entered into between the participating districts shall be approved by the state board of education.</p>
                  <p>(b) The boards of trustees agreeing to participate in the board of cooperative educational services shall appoint members of the participating boards of trustees to a board of cooperative educational services.

Each participating board of trustees shall have at least one (1) member appointed to the board of cooperative educational services. The terms of office of each of the members of the board of cooperative educational services shall be coterminous with their respective terms of office upon their boards of trustees. As the terms of office expire, or as vacancies occur, new members of the board of cooperative educational services shall be appointed by the board of trustees of the participating district.</p>

Board of Cooperative Educational Services".</p>
                  <p>(f) If the proposition to impose or continue the increased tax is defeated, the proposition shall not again be submitted to electors of the member school districts for at least eleven (11) months. If the proposition is defeated at any general election following initial adoption of the additional tax, the tax is repealed effective December 31 of that calendar year in which defeated and the levy imposed by the county commissioners for the following calendar year shall not exceed the levy authorized under W.S. 21-20-109.</p>

Any levy imposed under this subsection shall be used solely for purposes of maintaining programs offered by the board of cooperative educational services of which the district is a participant and when combined with any levy imposed under subsection (a) of this section, shall not exceed two (2) mills. A determination by the board to impose the levy shall be made at a regular or special meeting following a public hearing announced by the board. Any tax imposed under this subsection may be renewed by the board for an additional two (2) years subject to public hearing requirements specified under this subsection.

                  <p>(a) To provide a post secondary education enrollment options program under this section, a Wyoming school district board of trustees and a Wyoming community college district board of trustees or the University of Wyoming shall enter into an agreement whereby students resident of the participating district may attend post secondary education programs offered by the university or a participating community college. Effective for the 2011-2012 school year and each school year thereafter, the post secondary education enrollment options agreement shall comply with minimum educational standards defined by the commission in consultation with the department of education, community colleges and the University of Wyoming, including post secondary education enrollment options provided by means of distance education. Additional student eligibility requirements for program participation shall be based upon criteria established by the university or the community college in collaboration with the department of education, which address the high school grade level, uniform prior curricula requirements, academic achievement levels and national examination performance indicators.</p>
                  <p>(b) An eligible student may, according to the agreement between the school district and the university or community college, enroll in a postsecondary education program offered at:</p>
                  <p>(i) The university, a community college, an off-campus center or at a site meeting safety and accessibility requirements under the instruction of a faculty member;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A higher education center which is part of a college outreach cooperative education services agreement entered into by one (1) or more community college districts and one (1) or more school districts under W.S. 21-20-104; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) A high school or other facility maintained by the participating district, under the instruction of a certified teacher employed by the district or by a faculty member of the institution entering into an agreement with the district.</p>
                  <p>(c) A student participating in a postsecondary education enrollment options program pursuant to this section shall upon successfully completing any course offered under the program, receive academic credit by the resident school district which shall be counted towards the graduation requirements of the district. Evidence of successful completion of each course, the secondary credits granted and a statement that the credits were earned through program participation shall be made a part of the participating student's records maintained by the district. In addition, the participating student shall receive postsecondary education credit for any course successfully completed under the program.</p>
                  <p>(d) The school district and the university or community college district entering into an agreement for purposes of this section shall, if there are any fees within the agreement, establish fees to be assessed to the school district for student participation under the program, the payment schedule for the established fees and other necessary arrangements to facilitate fee payment and collection. Any textbooks, materials or equipment purchased under the established fees shall be addressed within the agreement entered into between the university or college and the school district. The university or community college shall not directly assess and collect any fee from the participating student for textbooks, materials, student services or any other fees otherwise assessed and collected from students attending the institution.</p>
                  <p>(e) A student participating in the program shall be counted within the average daily membership of the resident school district as defined under W.S. 21-13-101(a)(i) and concurrently by the participating higher education institution for its full-time equivalent enrollment count. Effective September 1, 2012 and each September 1 thereafter, any school district or institution participating in an enrollment options program agreement under this section, including any board of cooperative educational services established under W.S. 21-20-104 and involved in the program, shall file a report with the community college commission on student participation and completion and on revenues and expenditures attributable to program activities for the immediately preceding school year.</p>
                  <p>The report shall be based upon policy and guidelines developed by the statewide discussions conducted pursuant to section 2 of 2010 Senate File 39 as enacted into law. Not later than October 1 of each school year, the commission shall report to the joint education interim committee, the community colleges, the department of education and the University of Wyoming on statewide program revenues, expenditures and student participation and completion.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the postsecondary education options program is offered at a facility operated by the university or participating community college which is located at a reasonable distance from the high school at which the participating student is enrolled, the district may provide for the transportation of the student between the high school and the location at which the program is offered. Costs incurred by the district under this subsection shall be included as part of the district transportation expenses as used in computing the district foundation program amount under W.S. 21-13-309.</p>
                  <p>(g) Nothing in this section prohibits a high school student from taking a college or university course apart from agreements outlined in this section if the student bears the cost.</p>
                  <p>(h) Each school district board of trustees shall in conjunction with the University of Wyoming, community college district boards of trustees or other post secondary education institutions accredited by recognized and accepted accrediting agencies, make post secondary education options programs pursuant to this section reasonably accessible to eligible students.</p>

                <p>(a) In the event that official education records cannot be released to the parents for the purpose of transfer, the custodian of the records in the sending state shall prepare and furnish to the parent a complete set of unofficial educational records containing uniform information as determined by the interstate commission to the extent feasible. Upon receipt of the unofficial education records by a school in the receiving state, the school shall enroll and appropriately place the student based on the information provided in the unofficial records pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>(b) Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student, the school in the receiving state shall request the student's official education record from the school in the sending state. Upon receipt of this request, the school in the sending state will process and furnish the official education records to the school in the receiving state within ten (10) days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the rules promulgated by the interstate commission.</p>
                <p>(c) Compacting states shall give thirty (30) days from the date of entry, for students to obtain and provide proof of any immunization required by the receiving state. For a series of immunizations, initial vaccinations shall be obtained within thirty (30) days and the child shall be permitted to attend school while receiving continuing immunization if the school administrator receives notification or a waiver is granted in accordance with W.S. 21-4-309.</p>
                <p>(d) Students shall be allowed to continue their enrollment at grade level in the receiving state commensurate with their grade level, including kindergarten, from a local education agency in the sending state at the time of transition with the exception of children that have not yet met the age requirements as required by W.S. 21-4-301 and 21-4-302. A student that has satisfactorily completed the prerequisite grade level in the local education agency in the sending state shall be eligible for enrollment in the next highest grade level in the receiving state.

Course placement includes but is not limited to honors, international baccalaureate, advanced placement, vocational, technical and career pathways courses. Continuing the student's academic program from the previous school and promoting placement in academically and career challenging courses should be paramount when considering placement. This subsection does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued enrollment of the student in the courses.</p>
                <p>(b) The receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational programs based on current educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state or participation-placement in like programs in the sending state, provided that the program exists in the school and there is space available, as determined by the school district. Such programs include, but are not limited to gifted and talented programs and English as a second language (ESL). This subsection does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.</p>
                <p>(c) In compliance with the federal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.A. section 1400 et seq., the receiving state shall initially provide comparable services to a student with disabilities based on his current individualized education program (IEP).

This subsection does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student.</p>
                <p>(d) Local education agency administrative officials shall have flexibility in waiving course-program prerequisites or other preconditions for placement in courses-programs offered under the jurisdiction of the local education agency.</p>
                <p>(e) A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined by the compact and has been called to duty for, is on leave from or immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences at the discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with his parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.</p>

                <p>(i) Local education agency administrative officials shall use best efforts to waive specific courses required for graduation if similar course work has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial.

                <p>(iii) Should a military student transferring at the beginning or during his senior year be ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies shall to the extent possible ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local education agency, if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In the event that one (1) of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with paragraphs (a)(i) and (ii) of this subsection.</p>

The executive director shall serve as secretary to the interstate commission, but shall not be a member of the interstate commission. The executive director shall hire and supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate commission.</p>
                <p>(d) The interstate commission's executive director and its employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided, that such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person:</p>
                <p>(i) The liability of the interstate commission's executive director and employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors or omissions occurring within such person's state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person;</p>
                <p>(ii) The interstate commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person;</p>
                <p>(iii) To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state or the interstate commission, the representatives or employees of the interstate commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney's fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>21-24-112. Rulemaking functions of the interstate commission.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this act or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</p>
                <p>(b) Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Model State Administrative Procedure Act," of 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the interstate commission.</p>
                <p>(c) Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule, provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>21-24-113. Oversight, enforcement and dispute resolution.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Oversight:</p>
                <p>(i) The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state governments in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact shall have standing as statutory law;</p>
                <p>(ii) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission;</p>
                <p>(iii) The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact or promulgated rules.</p>
                <p>(b) If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default;</p>
                <p>(ii) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default;</p>
                <p>(iii) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default;</p>
                <p>(iv) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states;</p>
                <p>(v) The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination;</p>
                <p>(vi) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state;</p>
                <p>(vii) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
                <p>(c) Dispute resolution:</p>
                <p>(i) The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and nonmember states;</p>
                <p>(ii) The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</p>
                <p>(d) Enforcement:</p>
                <p>(i) The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact;</p>
                <p>(ii) The interstate commission, may by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees;</p>
                <p>(iii) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.</p>

                <p>(b) In accordance with the funding limit established in subsection (e) of this section, the interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.</p>
                <p>(c) The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.</p>
                <p>(d) The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission.</p>
                <p>(e) The interstate commission may not assess, levy or collect more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per year from Wyoming legislation appropriations. Other funding sources may be accepted and used to offset expenses related to the state's participation in the compact.</p>
