If the joint business council of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Indian tribes, the business council of the Eastern Shoshone Indian tribe or the business council of the Northern Arapaho Indian tribe participates in a joint powers board under this act with political subdivisions and special districts of Wyoming, the powers of the joint business council, the powers of the business council of the Eastern Shoshone Indian tribe, the powers of the business council of the Northern Arapaho Indian tribe, Wyoming political subdivisions and Wyoming special districts are neither increased or decreased by that participation. Rather the participation of the joint business council, the business council of the Eastern Shoshone Indian tribe or the business council of the Northern Arapaho Indian tribe is intended to facilitate implementation of programs and projects designed to more effectively benefit Wyoming's citizens.</p>
                  <p>(b) A county may enter into and operate under a joint powers agreement with one (1) or more counties, cities, school districts or community college districts for the performance of any function that the county, city, school district or community college district is authorized to perform, except the planning, expansion, creation, financing or operation of municipally owned electrical facilities.</p>
                  <p>(c) Specifically, without limiting but subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, two (2) or more agencies may jointly plan, own, lease, assign, sell, create, expand, finance and operate:</p>
                  <p>(i) Water including surface water drainage, sewerage, water and soil conservation or solid waste facilities;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Recreational facilities;</p>

                  <p>(xii) Rights-of-way for electric transmission systems, oil and natural gas pipelines, telecommunications and utilities. Any right-of-way acquired under the provisions of this subsection shall follow an existing utility corridor whenever practical;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Municipal natural gas facilities and systems.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any city-county airport board heretofore organized and operating pursuant to W.S. 10-5-101 through 10-5-204 shall be deemed a joint powers board, and shall not be required to reorganize as provided for by W.S. 16-1-106(a) but is subject to all other provisions of this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) A governing body of an eligible senior citizen center may enter into a joint powers agreement under this act in order to participate in the local government self-insurance program as provided in W.S. 1-42-201 through 1-42-206. An eligible senior citizen center which enters into a joint powers agreement pursuant to this subsection shall be bound by all provisions of the agreement, but shall not be entitled to participate as a member of the joint powers board.</p>
                  <p>(f) An agency may enter into an agreement with any governmental entity of another state, as defined in W.S. 1-39-103(a)(viii), for purposes of operating a cooperative public transportation program to transport passengers on one (1) or more routes beginning in, ending in or passing through Wyoming. Any agreement entered into under this subsection shall only apply to the operation of a cooperative public transportation program and shall be conditioned upon the other state extending or agreeing to extend its governmental immunity or other limitations of liability to any governmental entity of Wyoming while operating a cooperative public transportation program. As used in this subsection, "cooperative public transportation program" means a not-for-profit program designed to transport passengers to and from work or to another location on a regularly scheduled basis using vehicles operated by an agency or a governmental entity of another state.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>16-1-106. Joint powers boards; fiscal manager.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An agreement pursuant to this act may create a joint powers board to conduct a joint or cooperative undertaking. A joint powers board shall consist of not fewer than five (5) members, all of whom shall be qualified electors of the counties in which the board operates. Members of a joint powers board shall be appointed by the governing bodies of the participating agencies in any proportion or number the bodies feel would adequately reflect their interest. The initial appointments shall be by mutual agreement with staggered terms of one (1), two (2) and three (3) years and are subject to reappointment. Thereafter, appointments for a full term shall be for three (3) year staggered terms. Vacancies for unexpired terms shall be filled by appointment by the governing bodies of the participating agencies. Members of the board may be removed by the governing bodies of the participating agencies. It is not incompatible office holding for an officer or legal representative of a county, municipal corporation, school district, special district, public institution, agency, board, commission or political subdivision to be a member of a joint powers board.</p>
                  <p>(b) Promptly following appointment of its members, a joint powers board shall meet, organize and elect from its membership a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer. The secretary of a joint powers board shall notify the participating agencies of the board's organization and shall file a certificate with the county clerk and the secretary of state showing its organization. Upon filing the certificate, the joint powers board shall automatically become a body corporate and politic, and a public corporation with power to sue and be sued. The corporation has perpetual existence unless otherwise specified by the agreement providing for the corporation. No individual member of a joint powers board shall be personally liable for any actions or procedure of a joint powers board. When actually engaged in the performance of their duties, members of a joint powers board shall receive no compensation but shall be reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses as provided to state employees.</p>
                  <p>(c) A joint powers board shall meet at least once every three (3) months at the call of the chairman or within five (5) days after an oral or written request of a majority of the board members.</p>
                  <p>(d) Within the limits of its authorized and available funds, a joint powers board may employ technical, legal, administrative and clerical assistance and engage the services of research and consulting agencies. In the performance of its duties a joint powers board may utilize the services of any officer or employee of a participating agency with the approval of the governing body of the agency. Upon request of a joint powers board elected and appointed officers and employees of participating agencies shall promptly furnish the board information, statistics and reports under their control and shall otherwise cooperate with a joint powers board.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any agency participating in a joint powers project may appoint a joint powers board created by the agreement or any of the other agencies participating in the project as its agent to manage the project or to manage the finances of the project. The joint powers agreement may create a single fiscal manager to receive monies and make disbursements for the entire project. The fiscal manager may set up any necessary sinking funds, reserve funds or building funds for the use of the project.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any joint project consisting of property or improvements or an interest therein to be owned by participating agencies or a joint powers board undertaken pursuant to this act may be financed:</p>
                  <p>(i) By the contribution of funds from one (1) or more participating agencies which would be available to each agency if proceeding individually;</p>
                  <p>(ii) By bond issues by one (1) or more participating agencies to construct, improve or acquire an interest in any facility in the same manner as bonds may be issued by the agency for its individual construction, improvement or acquisition of such a facility;</p>
                  <p>(iii) By revenue bonds issued by a joint powers board to be repaid solely from revenues provided by this section or any revenue received by a joint powers board from the ownership, lease or operation of property or interest in property owned, leased or controlled by the board. Revenue securities may be issued upon majority approval of the members of a joint powers board and may be executed and delivered at any time, in the form, denominations and amounts, and may be redeemed or repurchased prior to maturity with or without premium, and may bear interest as provided by resolution of a joint powers board authorizing the issue. These securities shall meet the procedural requirements and provisions of W.S. 35-2-425 through 35-2-428 as provided for the issuance of bonds by hospital districts;</p>
                  <p>(iv) By facilities privately owned and leased to two (2) or more agencies or a joint powers board if the lease agreement provides that upon termination of the lease agreement title to the facilities vests in the participating agencies;</p>

                  <p>(vi) By industrial development project bonds issued pursuant to W.S. 15-1-701 et seq.</p>

                  <p>(a) No participating agency nor any legal entity created pursuant to this act shall construct, operate or maintain any facility or improvement other than for service to and use by the participating agencies and their resident customers, except for undertakings pursuant to W.S. 16-1-104(c)(xii).</p>
                  <p>(b) No agreement pursuant to this act shall relieve any participating agency of any obligation or responsibility imposed upon it by law except to the extent of actual and timely performance thereof by a joint powers board or other legal or administrative entity created by an agreement hereunder, the performance may be offered in satisfaction of the obligation or responsibility.</p>
                  <p>(c) After April 1, 1998, any legal entity created pursuant to this act or any of its participating agencies, which owns, constructs, operates or maintains a municipal or rural domestic water supply system funded in whole or in part by state grants or loans, shall not assess public entities or individual water users in the cooperating agencies' service area water rate charges which exceed the actual costs of providing and delivering water to the point of connection to the public entities' or individual water users' water system. The governing body of the entity may establish one (1) or more service areas in each of which an average water rate may be used for all customers. A one time connection fee or system investment fee reasonably calculated to permit recovery of a proportionate share of the system infrastructure cost necessary to treat and convey the water may also be charged. A one-time fee may also be charged to recover reasonable expenses incurred by the public entity in determining the actual costs of treating and delivering water to the point of connection. Charges for special services such as customer's line maintenance shall be in addition to the water rate. As used in this subsection, "actual costs of providing and delivering water" shall include a proportionate share of the following costs related to the water system:</p>
                  <p>(i) Fees, interest charges and principal payments on all bonds issued and other indebtedness incurred to construct, purchase or improve the utility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Salaries and wages of employees;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The cost of materials, supplies, utilities and outside services;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Other costs directly related to the delivery system;</p>
                  <p>(v) The cost for providing and maintaining a depreciation fund, a fund for emergencies and a fund for acquisition and development of new water rights and water sources;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Administrative and overhead expenses; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) The cost of acquiring, transporting, processing and treating water.</p>
                  <p>(d) If requested by the party seeking water service who resides outside the public entity's service area and upon approval of the public entity, subsection (c) of this section shall not apply if the ratio of the established rate charged to customers outside the area to the rate within the public entities service area is less than one and one-quarter (1.25) to one (1).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>16-1-109. State loan and investment board loans; amount; interest; security; conditions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The state loan and investment board may negotiate and make loans to one (1) or more agencies, the University of Wyoming, or joint powers boards presently existing, permitted or created pursuant to the statutes, from the permanent mineral trust funds and other permanent funds of Wyoming not otherwise obligated, not to exceed sixty million dollars ($60,000,000.00) including all loans previously made and outstanding, and not to exceed a term of forty (40) years for repayment. The board shall set rates of interest on all such loans according to the current rates of interest for similar securities on the commercial market upon a basis which will not be less than the average rate of return realized on all permanent mineral trust fund investments as determined by the state treasurer for the five (5) calendar years immediately preceding the year in which the loan is made. For all loans under this section approved after July 1, 1996, a loan origination fee of one percent (1%) of the loan shall be paid to the state loan and investment board by the borrowing agency, university or joint powers board. The revenue produced by this fee shall be credited to the loss reserve account as provided by W.S. 16-1-110.</p>
                  <p>(b) In making loans pursuant to this act, the state loan and investment board shall establish requirements and standards which it determines to be necessary and advisable.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon approval of a loan, an agency, the university, participating agencies, or a joint powers board shall transfer title or its interest to the property upon which facilities are to be constructed, including later improvements, to the state loan and investment board, or the state loan and investment board may require the security it deems necessary. The recipient of the loan shall make reasonable annual rental charges or loan payments as specified by the state loan and investment board. Upon repayment of the loan, title to or interest in the property and improvements shall be reconveyed to the appropriate agency, university, participating agencies or joint powers board. Where the transfer of title or interest in the property would preclude the obtaining of federal grants or where transfer of title or interest is prohibited by or would be in violation of existing grant-in-aid agreements, the state loan and investment board may waive the requirements of transfer of title or transfer of any interest in the property, and substitute other security of sufficient value as it deems necessary.</p>
                  <p>(d) Loans under this section shall be made only under the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Loans shall be made only for facilities generating user fees only to the extent that the user fees will repay the loan such that the loan can be considered a reasonable and prudent investment of state permanent funds. Any portion of the revenue generating facility unable to be financed by user fees may be financed by a grant under W.S. 9-4-604(g) and (h) to agencies and joint powers boards otherwise authorized to receive grants under those provisions;</p>
                  <p>(ii) No security other than a lien on the facilities used to generate user fees to repay the loan and pledges of user fees shall be taken to secure the loan except that the entity or joint powers board receiving the loan may also be required to issue revenue bonds to the state to evidence the loan if statutory authority exists for the entity to issue revenue bonds for the facility. No property shall be taken as security unless the property is owned by the entity to which the loan will be made. Upon repayment of the loan, liens against the property and revenue shall be released by the state loan and investment board;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Loans shall be made to the governmental entity or entities whose inhabitants receive a direct service or benefit from the revenue generating facility;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The state loan and investment board shall receive annual financial statements from entities receiving loans under this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(v) No loan shall be made without the written opinion of the attorney general certifying the legality of the transaction and all documents connected therewith;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The board shall request a review and recommendation from the aeronautics commission on all applications for loans for the construction, development and improvement of airport facilities generating user fees and shall make any loan recommended by the aeronautics commission unless, based upon the credit worthiness of the project, the board determines the loan would not be a prudent investment.</p>
                  <p>(e) The board, whenever it deems necessary for the better protection of permanent funds of the state invested in loans under this section, may refinance any delinquent loan and reamortize the loan over not more than thirty (30) years from the date of refinancing. All costs of refinancing the loan shall be paid by the borrowing entity and no loan shall be refinanced where it appears refinancing will jeopardize the collection of the loan. An additional fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of the reamortized loan shall be paid by the borrowing entity to the board to be credited to the loss reserve account created by W.S. 16-1-110 as provided by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

Funds in the account shall be used for the purposes specified in subsection</p>

If at the end of any fiscal year, the amount in the loss reserve account exceeds five percent (5%) of the total amount of permanent funds invested by the state in loans pursuant to W.S. 16-1-109, the amount in excess of the five percent (5%) shall be transferred and credited to the general fund.</p>
                  <p>(b) If, as a result of default in the payment of any loan made pursuant to W.S. 16-1-109, there occurs a nonrecoverable loss either to the corpus of, or interest due to, any permanent fund of the state, the state loan and investment board shall restore the loss to the permanent fund account entitled thereto using any funds available in the loss reserve account created by subsection (a) of this section. If the funds in the loss reserve account are insufficient to restore the full amount of the loss, the board shall submit a detailed report of the loss to the legislature and shall request an appropriation to restore the balance of the loss to the permanent fund account entitled thereto.</p>

                <p>(i) Give at least forty-five (45) days notice of its intended action.

                <p>(G) A statement whether the proposed rule change meets minimum substantive state statutory requirements or whether the proposed rule change exceeds minimum substantive state statutory requirements. If the rule change exceeds minimum substantive state statutory requirements, the agency shall include a statement explaining the reason why the rule exceeds minimum substantive statutory requirements;</p>
                <p>(H) A statement that the agency has complied with the requirements of W.S. 9-5-304 and the location where an interested person may obtain a copy of the assessment used to evaluate the proposed rule pursuant to W.S. 9-5-304;</p>

                <p>(ii) Afford all interested persons reasonable opportunity to submit data, views or arguments, orally or in writing, provided this period shall consist of at least forty- five (45) days from the later of the dates specified under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, and provided:</p>
                <p>(A) In the case of substantive rules, opportunity for oral hearing shall be granted if requested by twenty-five (25) persons, or by a governmental subdivision, or by an association having not less than twenty-five (25) members.

                <p>(iii) Comply with the requirements of W.S. 9-5-304.</p>
                <p>(b) When an agency finds that an emergency requires the agency to proceed without notice or opportunity for hearing required by subsection (a) of this section, it may adopt emergency rules. An emergency rule is effective when filed. A state agency emergency rule shall bear the endorsement of the governor's concurrence on the finding of emergency before the registrar of rules accepts the rule for filing. The rule so adopted shall be effective for no longer than one hundred twenty (120) days but the adoption of an identical rule under W.S. 16-3-103(a) or of an emergency rule under this subsection is not precluded. In no case shall identical or substantially similar emergency rules be effective for a total period of more than two hundred forty (240) days. A local agency may proceed with the emergency rule when notice of the emergency is filed with the local registrar of rules.</p>
                <p>(c) No rule is valid unless submitted, filed and adopted in substantial compliance with this section. A proceeding to contest any rule on the ground of noncompliance with the procedural requirements of this section must be commenced within two (2) years from the effective date of the rule.</p>
                <p>(d) No state agency rule or any amendment, repeal, modification or revision of the rule may be filed with the registrar of rules unless the rule has been submitted to the governor for review and the governor has approved and signed the rule. Except in the case of emergency rules and rules adopted by the game and fish commission fixing general hunting or fishing regulations, season or bag limits or establishing hunting areas, the governor shall not approve any rule until the date of receipt of the legislative management council's recommendation under W.S. 28-9-106(a) or until forty (40) days after the rule is filed with the legislative service office pursuant to W.S. 28-9-103(b), whichever is sooner. During the process of approving rules, the governor may disapprove any portion of a rule not conforming to paragraphs (d)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section by clearly indicating the portion of the rule disapproved and the basis for the disapproval. Only those portions of a rule approved by the governor shall be filed with the registrar of rules as provided by W.S. 16-3-104(a). Any portion of a rule disapproved by the governor shall be returned to the agency and shall be null and void and shall not be filed, implemented or enforced. The governor shall report his disapproval of any rule or portion thereof to the management council within fifteen (15) days. The governor shall not approve any rule or any amendment, repeal, modification or revision of the rule unless it:</p>
                <p>(i) Is within the scope of the statutory authority delegated to the adopting agency;</p>
                <p>(ii) Appears to be within the scope of the legislative purpose of the statutory authority; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Has been adopted in compliance with the procedural requirements of this act. For the purposes of this subsection, an "agency" means any authority, bureau, board, commission, department, division, officer or employee of the state, excluding the state legislature and the judiciary.</p>
                <p>(e) If a state agency created as a licensing or regulatory board or commission for any profession or occupation regulated under title 33 regularly publishes a newsletter, memorandum or other written or electronic communication which serves as a medium to provide information to members of the regulated profession or occupation, then in addition to the notice requirements of subsection (a) of this section, the agency shall publish within that medium the proposed rules in a format conforming to any requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection</p>
                <p>(f) of this section. If the agency determines publication in such manner is not practicable, it shall publish within the chosen medium at least once prior to taking final action to adopt, amend or repeal any rule notice of its intended rulemaking proceedings and make available the full text of all proposed changes in the format conforming to any requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. This subsection shall not apply to emergency rules adopted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(f) The state registrar of rules shall prescribe a format for state agencies to follow in preparing proposed amendments to existing rules which shall ensure that additions to and deletions from existing language are clearly indicated.</p>
                <p>(g) Upon receipt of a notice of intended action from a state agency under paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the secretary of state's office shall maintain a file of these notices and make them available for public inspection during regular business hours. A notice shall remain in the file until the rules are adopted or until the agency determines not to take action to adopt the proposed rules. To the extent that resources enable the office to do so, the secretary of state's office shall make these notices available to the public electronically. The secretary of state may promulgate rules specifying the format of notices submitted by state agencies under this subsection. Compliance with this subsection shall not affect the validity of rules promulgated by state agencies.</p>
                <p>(h) An agency may incorporate, by reference in its rules and without publishing the incorporated matter in full, all or any part of a code, standard, rule or regulation that has been adopted by an agency of the United States or of this state, another state or by a nationally recognized organization or association, provided:</p>
                <p>(i) The agency determines that incorporation of the full text in agency rules would be cumbersome or inefficient given the length or nature of the rules;</p>
                <p>(ii) The reference in the rules of the incorporating agency fully identifies the incorporated matter by location, date and otherwise, and states that the rule does not include any later amendments or editions of the incorporated matter;</p>
                <p>(iii) The agency, organization or association originally issuing the incorporated matter makes copies of it readily available to the public;</p>
                <p>(iv) The incorporating agency maintains and makes available for public inspection a copy of the incorporated matter at cost from the agency and the rules of the incorporating agency state where the incorporated matter is available on the internet as defined in W.S. 9-2-1035(a)(iii); and</p>
                <p>(v) The incorporating agency otherwise complies with all procedural requirements under this act and the rules of the registrar of state agency rules governing the promulgation and filing of agency rules.</p>
                <p>(j) Each state agency shall adopt as much of the uniform rules promulgated pursuant to the following provisions as is consistent with the specific and distinct requirements of the agency and state or federal law governing or applicable to the agency:</p>
                <p>(i) W.S. 16-3-102(d);</p>
                <p>(ii) W.S. 16-4-204(e).</p>

State agencies shall file each rule within seventy-five (75) days of the date of agency action adopting the rule or it is not effective. There shall be noted upon the rule a citation of the authority by which it or any part of it was adopted.

The notice shall contain a citation to the rule and the date it was filed. Failure to send the notice required under this subsection does not affect the effectiveness of the rule.</p>
                <p>(b) Each rule and any amendment or repeal adopted after June 1, 1982 is effective after filing in accordance with subsection (a) of this section and W.S. 28-9-108 except:</p>
                <p>(i) If a later date is required by statute or specified in the rule, the later date is the effective date;</p>
                <p>(ii) Where the agency finds that an emergency exists and the finding is concurred in by the governor, a rule or amendment or repeal may be effective immediately upon filing with the registrar of rules and if a state agency, also with the legislative service office. Existing rules remain in effect unless amended or repealed, subject to this section or W.S. 28-9-105 or 28-9-106.</p>
                <p>(c) Rules shall be prepared in the manner and form prescribed by the state registrar of rules. The registrar of rules may refuse to accept for filing any rule that does not conform to the prescribed form.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>16-3-107. Contested cases; general procedure.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) In any contested case, all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice served personally or by mail. Where the indispensable and necessary parties are composed of a large class, the notice shall be served upon a reasonable number thereof as representatives of the class or by giving notice by publication in the manner specified by the rules or an order of the agency.</p>
                <p>(b) The notice shall include a statement of:</p>
                <p>(i) The time, place and nature of the hearing;</p>
                <p>(ii) The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held;</p>
                <p>(iii) The particular sections of the statutes and rules involved;</p>
                <p>(iv) A short and plain statement of the matters asserted. If the agency or other party is unable to state the matters in detail at the time the notice is served, the initial notice may be limited to a statement of the issues involved, and thereafter upon application a more definite and detailed statement shall be furnished.</p>
                <p>(c) In all contested cases, depositions and discovery relating thereto, agencies shall have the authority to administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses and require the production of any books, papers or other documents relevant or material to the inquiry. In case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued by the agency in a contested case, deposition or discovery relating thereto, to any person, the district court for the district in which the hearing or deposition or other proceeding is being conducted, or for the district where the person may be served, may upon application by the agency issue to the person refusing to obey the subpoena an order requiring the person to show cause for the refusal or to appear before the agency or other person designated by it there to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or there to give evidence touching the matter in question. Any failure to show cause or obey the order of court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.</p>
                <p>(d) In all contested cases the agency shall as part of its rules of practice provide that the agency or one (1) of its presiding officers designated by it upon application of any party shall issue a subpoena requiring the appearance of witnesses for the purpose of taking evidence or requiring the production of any books, papers or other documents relevant or material to the inquiry.</p>
                <p>(e) The agency upon motion made promptly and in any event at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance therewith, may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive, or in the event issued pursuant to subsection (g) of this section may condition denial of the motion upon the advancement by the person in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost of producing the books, papers, documents or tangible things.</p>
                <p>(f) If a subpoena issued pursuant to this section is disobeyed and if the agency fails to apply pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for enforcement any party may apply to the district court for the district having venue under subsection (c) of this section for enforcement pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                <p>(g) In all contested cases the taking of depositions and discovery shall be available to the parties in accordance with the provisions of Rules 26, 28 through 37 (excepting Rule 37(b)(1) and 37(b)(2)(A)(vii) therefrom) of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure in effect on the date of the enactment of this act and any subsequent rule amendments thereto. All references therein to the "court" shall be deemed to refer to the appropriate "agency"; all references to the use of the subpoena power shall be references to subsection (c) of this section; all references to "trial" shall be deemed references to "hearing"; all references to "plaintiff" shall be deemed references to "a party". If a party or other witness refuses to be sworn or refuses to answer any question after being directed to do so by the agency in which the action is pending, the refusal to obey the agency order shall be enforced in the same manner as is provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                <p>(h) Any agency which is a party to the contested case is subject to the discovery provisions of this section but neither the agency, nor any member, officer or employee shall be required to disclose information which is confidential or privileged under the law and no member of the presiding agency shall be compelled to testify or give a deposition in a contested case. Discovery sought from the agency initially shall be by written application. If the agency refuses to allow discovery in whole or in part the aggrieved party may apply to the presiding officer for an order compelling discovery. If the presiding officer fails or refuses to compel discovery, the aggrieved party may apply to the district court for the district in which the hearing, deposition or other proceeding is being or is to be conducted for an order directed to the agency compelling discovery. The presiding officer or district court shall enter such order as may be appropriate.</p>
                <p>(j) Opportunity shall be afforded all parties to respond and present evidence and argument on all issues involved. Any person compelled to appear in person before any agency or representative thereof shall be accorded the right to be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative.</p>
                <p>(k) Every party shall be accorded the right to appear in person or by or with counsel or other duly qualified representative in any agency proceeding in accordance with such rules as the agency prescribes and the pertinent rules of the supreme court of Wyoming. So far as the orderly conduct of public business permits, any interested person may appear before any agency or its responsible officers or employees for the presentation, adjustment or determination of any issue, request or controversy in any proceeding (interlocutory, summary or otherwise) or in connection with any agency function. Every agency shall proceed with reasonable dispatch to conclude any matter presented to it except that due regard shall be had for the convenience and necessity of the parties or their representatives. Any person representing an agency at a hearing in a contested case in which the agency is a party shall not in the same case serve as presiding officer or provide ex parte advice regarding the case to the presiding officer or to the body or any member of the body comprising the decision makers.</p>
                <p>(m) No process, requirement of a report, inspection, or other investigative act or demand shall be issued, made or enforced in any manner or for any purpose except as authorized by law. Every person compelled to submit data or evidence is entitled to retain or, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, procure a copy of a transcript thereof, except that in a nonpublic investigatory proceeding the witness may for good cause be limited to inspection of the official transcript of his testimony.</p>
                <p>(n) Unless precluded by law, informal disposition may be made of any contested case by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default.</p>
                <p>(o) The record in a contested case must include:</p>
                <p>(i) All formal or informal notices, pleadings, motions and intermediate rulings;</p>
                <p>(ii) Evidence received or considered including matters officially noticed;</p>
                <p>(iii) Questions and offers of proof, objections and rulings thereon;</p>
                <p>(iv) Any proposed findings and exceptions thereto;</p>
                <p>(v) Any opinion, findings, decision or order of the agency and any report by the officer presiding at the hearing.</p>
                <p>(p) In all contested cases the proceeding including all testimony shall be reported verbatim stenographically or by any other appropriate means determined by the agency or the officer presiding at the hearing.</p>
                <p>(q) Oral proceedings or any part thereof shall be transcribed on request of any party upon payment of the cost thereof.</p>
                <p>(r) Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence and matters officially noticed.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>16-4-202. Right of inspection; rules and regulations; unavailability; training.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) All public records shall be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times, during business hours of the governmental entity, except as provided in this act or as otherwise provided by law, but the governmental entity may make rules and regulations with reference to the inspection of the records as is reasonably necessary for the protection of the records and the prevention of unnecessary interference with the regular discharge of the duties of the governmental entity. All applications for public records shall be made to the designated public records person.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the public records requested are not in the custody or control of the governmental entity to whom application is made, the designated public records person shall notify the applicant within seven (7) business days from the date of acknowledged receipt of the request of the unavailability of the records sought and provide the name and contact information of the appropriate designated public records person if known.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the public records requested are in the custody and control of the governmental entity to whom application is made, the following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the records are in active use or in storage, and therefore not available at the time an applicant asks to examine them, the designated public records person shall immediately forward the request to the custodian or authorized person having personal custody and control of the public records and shall notify the applicant of this situation within seven (7) business days from the date of acknowledged receipt of the request;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a public record is readily available, it shall be released immediately to the applicant so long as the release does not impair or impede the governmental entity's ability to discharge its other duties;</p>
                  <p>(iii) All public records shall be released not later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of acknowledged receipt of the request unless good cause exists preventing release as authorized by paragraph (iv) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If good cause exists preventing release within the time period specified in paragraph (iii) of this subsection, the public records shall be released on a specified date mutually agreed to by the applicant and the governmental entity. If a release date cannot be agreed upon, the applicant may file a complaint with the ombudsman as provided by paragraph (v) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(v) The applicant may at any time file a complaint with an ombudsman designated by the governor or may petition the district court for a determination as to whether the custodian has demonstrated good cause. In determining whether good cause existed, the ombudsman or district court may consider whether the records are privileged or confidential by law or whether release of the records impairs or impedes the governmental entity's ability to discharge its other duties. The ombudsman or the district court shall review the records in camera and determine whether redaction of privileged or confidential information would permit release of the records.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a public record exists primarily or solely in an electronic format, the custodian of the record shall so inform the requester. Electronic record inspection and copying shall be subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The reasonable costs of producing a copy of the public record shall be borne by the party making the request. The costs may include the cost of producing a copy of the public record and the cost of constructing the record, including the cost of programming and computer services;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A governmental entity shall provide an electronic record, if requested, in alternative electronic file types unless doing so is impractical or impossible;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A governmental entity shall not be required to compile data, extract data or create a new document to comply with an electronic record request;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A governmental entity shall not be required to allow inspection or copying of a record in its electronic format if doing so would jeopardize or compromise the security or integrity of the original record or of any proprietary software in which it is maintained;</p>
                  <p>(v) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the governor from enacting any rules pursuant to his authority under W.S. 19-13-104(c)(i).</p>
                  <p>(e) Each governmental entity shall designate a person to receive all applications for public records. The designated public records person shall be an employee, officer, contractor or agent of the governmental entity. The governmental entity shall submit the name, business email address and business mailing address of the designated public records person to the department of administration and information for publication on the department of administration and information official website. The designated public records person shall serve as a point of contact between the governmental entity and applicants seeking public records.</p>

                  <p>(a) In all cases in which a person has the right to inspect and copy any public records he may request that he be furnished copies, printouts or photographs for a reasonable fee to be set by the official custodian. Where fees for certified copies or other copies, printouts or photographs of the record are specifically prescribed by law, the specific fees shall apply. Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing a fee to be charged as a condition of making a public record available for inspection.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the custodian does not have the facilities for making copies, printouts or photographs of records which the applicant has the right to inspect, then the applicant shall be granted access to the records for the purpose of making copies, printouts or photographs. The copies, printouts or photographs shall be made while the records are in the possession, custody and control of the custodian thereof and are subject to the supervision of the custodian. When practical the copy work shall be made in the place where the records are kept, but if it is impractical to do so, the custodian may allow arrangements to be made for this purpose. If other facilities are necessary the cost of providing them shall be paid by the person desiring a copy, printout or photograph of the records. The official custodian may establish a reasonable schedule of time for making copies, printouts or photographs and may charge a reasonable fee for the services rendered by him or his deputy in supervising the copying, printing out or photographing as he may charge for furnishing copies under this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) After July 1, 2003, any fees or charges assessed by a custodian of a public record shall first be authorized by duly enacted or adopted statute, rule, resolution, ordinance, executive order or other like authority.</p>

                  <p>(b) Special meetings may be called by the presiding officer of a governing body by giving verbal, electronic or written notice of the meeting to each member of the governing body and to each newspaper of general circulation, radio or television station requesting the notice. The notice shall specify the time and place of the special meeting and the business to be transacted and shall be issued at least eight (8) hours prior to the commencement of the meeting. No other business shall be considered at a special meeting. Proof of delivery of verbal notice to the newspaper of general circulation, radio or television station may be made by affidavit of the clerk or other employee or officer of the agency charged or responsible for distribution of the notice of the meeting.</p>
                  <p>(c) The governing body of an agency may recess any regular, special, or recessed regular or special meeting to a place and at a time specified in an order of recess.

                  <p>(d) The governing body of an agency may hold an emergency meeting on matters of serious immediate concern to take temporary action without notice. Reasonable effort shall be made to offer public notice.

In such case the governing body may reconsider and act upon the temporary action at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the agency, but in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of the emergency action.</p>
                  <p>(e) Day-to-day administrative activities of an agency, its officers and its employees shall not be subject to the notice requirements of this section.</p>

Following the hearing or executive session, the governing body may deliberate on its decision in executive sessions;</p>

                  <p>The proceeds of refunding public securities shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the public securities to be refunded or be placed in escrow in any state or national bank within the state which is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation and which has trust powers, to be applied to the payment of the public securities being refunded upon their presentation. Any accrued interest and any premium appertaining to a sale of refunding public securities may be applied to the payment of the principal and interest, or both may be deposited in a reserve account, or may be used to defray incidental costs, as the governing body may determine. Any escrow shall not be limited to proceeds of refunding public securities, but may include other monies available for its purpose. Any escrowed proceeds, may be invested or reinvested in federal securities. Escrowed proceeds and investments, together with any interest or other yield to be derived from any investment, shall be in an amount at all times sufficient to cover principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due, and any charges of the escrow agent, to pay the public securities being refunded as they become due at their respective maturities or due at designated prior redemption dates in connection with which the governing body of the issuer shall exercise a prior redemption option. The computations made in determining sufficiency shall be verified by a certified public accountant certificated to practice in this state or in any other state.</p>
                  <p>Any purchaser of any refunding public security is not responsible for the application of the proceeds thereof by the issuer or any of its officers, agents or employees.</p>

In the alternative, the governing body may, in its discretion, designate appropriate public officials to sign, countersign, execute or attest any refunding public security or appurtenant coupon. Any officer so authorized may utilize a facsimile signature in lieu of his manual signature in the manner provided by law, provided that compliance with any law other than this act is not a condition of execution with a facsimile signature of any interest coupon. The clerk may cause the seal or a facsimile of the seal of the issuer to be printed, stamped or otherwise placed on any refunding public security.</p>
                  <p>The facsimile seal shall have the same legal effect as the impression of the seal.

Any officer authorized to sign, countersign, execute or attest any refunding public security or interest coupon, at the time of its execution or of the execution of a signature certificate, may adopt for his facsimile signature the facsimile signature of his predecessor in office in the event the facsimile signature appears upon the refunding public security or coupons, or upon both the public security and coupons.</p>

The indebtedness of any public body outstanding at the time a part or parts of the public body are detached therefrom by any lawful means, and which public body has retained its lawful corporate existence subsequent to the detachment of the land from the public body may be refunded by action of the governing body of the public body from which land has been detached with or without concurrence or action by the governing board of the public body, if any, within which the detached land is included.</p>

                  <p>The governing body shall cause to be levied annually, without limitation of rate or amount, upon all taxable property of the issuer, in addition to other authorized taxes, a sufficient sum to pay the principal of and interest on the refunding public securities until the refunding public securities issued pursuant to this act are fully paid. The governing body may apply any other funds that are in the treasury of the issuer and available for payment of the interest or principal as it respectively matures, and the levy or levies provided for may be diminished. Should the tax for the payment of the principal and interest on any refunding public security at any time not be levied or collected in time to meet the payment, or if the refunding public securities are issued at a time which makes it impossible to levy a tax for the initial installments of principal or interest, the principal or interest so maturing shall be paid out of the general fund of the issuer, or from any other funds available for that purpose. For the purpose of reimbursing the fund or funds the money so used may be repaid from the first monies collected from taxes thereafter levied. The full faith and credit of the issuer shall be pledged for the punctual payment of the principal and interest on the refunding public securities. If the public securities to be refunded and the interest accruing would have been paid from taxes levied upon only part of the taxable property within the boundaries of the issuer, the taxes levied for payment or redemption of the refunding public securities, and the interest accruing shall be levied in the same manner and upon only the same taxable property as would have been levied for the payment of the public securities to be refunded if no refunding of the public securities had been accomplished. Any tax levied to retire any refunding public security issued by a hospital district is subject to the limitations set forth in W.S. 35-2-414, provided any refunding securities issued under this act to refund local improvement bonds shall be payable solely from and secured by the pledge of special assessments under W.S. 15-6-401 through 15-6-448.</p>

                  <p>(a) For all public works awarded by the state, the University of Wyoming, a community college or a school district pursuant to W.S. 16-6-101 through 16-6-206 estimated to cost one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) or more, a contractor who commits to ensure that not less than ten percent (10%) of the labor hours shall be worked by apprentices shall have his bid considered as if his bid were one percent (1%) lower than the actual dollar value of his bid. The contractor awarded a contract under this section, after consideration of all other applicable preferences under this chapter, shall be awarded the contract at the actual dollar value of his bid under this section. This subsection shall not apply to those state agencies that have a recognized or approved apprenticeship training program requirement by the United States department of labor or other appropriate federally funded program.</p>
                  <p>(b) Following award of a contract under subsection (a) of this section, the department may, upon a demonstration of good cause shown by the contractor, excuse the contractor from the requirement that not less than ten percent (10%) of the labor hours on a specific project be performed by apprentices.</p>
                  <p>(c) A contractor awarded a contract under this section shall make reasonable efforts to comply with the apprentice utilization preference provisions in this section so that the appropriate percentage of total labor hours is performed by apprentices. The contractor shall report to the department within fifteen (15) days after completion of the project, providing a statement describing compliance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section if he received preferential consideration of his bid based on a commitment to ensure the specified total labor hours on the project would be performed by apprentices. The department shall report to the agency that awarded the contract, any contractor who received preferential consideration of his bid based on a commitment to ensure the specified total labor hours would be performed by apprentices on a project and who fails to file such report, or who fails to meet the total labor hours commitment for apprentices specified in his bid. Any contractor failing to file a report or failing to meet the total labor hours requirement for apprentices specified in his bid shall forfeit one percent (1%) of the total project cost to the state agency that awarded the contract, which amount shall be credited to the account from which the project was funded, unless good cause is shown as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department shall provide necessary assistance to an agency awarding a contract subject to the provisions of this section. The department shall collect the following data from each affected contractor for each project covered by this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) The number of apprentices and labor hours worked by them;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>16-6-1001. Capital construction projects restrictions; preference requirements; waivers.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by federal law, any funds appropriated to or authorized for expenditure by a public entity for capital construction projects shall be subject to the restrictions of this section which shall be construed where possible as complimentary and consistent with other statutory requirements relating to competitive bidding and contractor preferences. To the extent the restrictions in this section are inconsistent with other state statutes, this section shall supersede all such inconsistent provisions and shall govern. This section shall be applied as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) This paragraph shall apply to any alternate design and construction delivery method as defined in W.S. 16-6-701(a)(v):</p>
                  <p>(A) All contracts shall require the construction manager at risk or design builder to conduct an open bid process in compliance with Wyoming contractor preference laws before awarding any subcontracts for work covered under the contract;</p>
                  <p>(B) Unless exempted pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph the construction manager at risk or design builder shall award to responsible Wyoming resident contractors not less than seventy percent (70%) of the work covered by the manager's or builder's contract. As used in this subparagraph "work covered" shall be calculated using the total contract price and the total of payments made to all subcontractors under the contract, including materials but excluding from both amounts the price for any part of the contract for which a waiver is provided under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(C) The requirement of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may be waived for any part of the subcontract work to be performed under the contract. If waived in part, the remaining value of the total subcontract work to be performed under the contract is subject to and shall be used to calculate compliance with the requirement of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. A waiver shall require a written determination that:</p>
                  <p>(I) The work to be performed is specialized or of such a scale that it can be more suitably performed by out-of-state contractors;</p>
                  <p>(II) The bid amounts submitted by responsible Wyoming subcontractors exceed one hundred five percent (105%) of the costs of out-of-state providers for equivalent quality of work or services;</p>
                  <p>(III) The enforcement of the requirement would unreasonably delay completion of construction; or</p>
                  <p>(IV) There were insufficient responsible Wyoming contractors submitting bids to make the seventy percent (70%) requirement.</p>
                  <p>(V) Repealed by Laws 2012, Ch. 106, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(D) Any waiver shall be approved in writing by the following persons:</p>
                  <p>(I) For projects to be completed by the state of Wyoming, by the director of the state construction department;</p>
                  <p>(II) For projects to be completed by the University of Wyoming, by the president of the university and the chairman of the board of trustees;</p>
                  <p>(III) For projects subject to review by the state construction department under title 21 of Wyoming statutes, by the director of the state construction department and the chairman of the board of the school facilities commission;</p>
                  <p>(IV) For projects completed by a community college, by the community college president and its chairman of the board of trustees;</p>
                  <p>(V) For all other projects, by the respective governing body.</p>
                  <p>(E) Any approved waiver shall be documented in writing and provided to the governor. Notice of all approved waivers shall also be published on a website maintained by the state construction department, including a statement of the grounds for the waiver.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Unless exempted pursuant to subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, this paragraph shall apply to all construction delivery methods:</p>
                  <p>(A) The procurement of furniture and movable equipment shall be done by competitive bid based upon:</p>
                  <p>(I) Specifications written for products that are available from Wyoming resident suppliers; or</p>
                  <p>(II) If specified products are not available from any Wyoming resident supplier, specifications addressing performance standards and functional requirements determined by the public entity. The public entity may specify suggested individual brands or manufacturers, provided that similar products that meet or exceed specifications shall be accepted as substitute products. Specified products that are not available to any responsible Wyoming resident suppliers shall not be used in any group or package within the bid documents which would exclude responsible Wyoming resident suppliers from submitting a bid on the final bid package.</p>
                  <p>(B) No person who was employed by the public entity to prepare the bid documents, whether with or without compensation, shall be eligible to bid on the final bid package;</p>
                  <p>(C) A five percent (5%) preference shall be granted to responsible Wyoming resident suppliers for procurements by public entities and that are used in and incorporated into a capital construction project;</p>
                  <p>(D) The requirements of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may be waived by a political subdivision of the state for furniture or movable equipment upon a written determination that the furniture or movable equipment requirements of the project are so specialized or that an item or type of furniture or movable equipment is so unique or uncommon that failure to waive the requirements would materially impair the functionality of the project. Waivers under this subparagraph shall be approved by the governing body of the political subdivision.</p>
                  <p>(iii) All bids shall be opened in public at a location designated by the public entity soliciting the bid. This paragraph shall apply to all construction delivery methods;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Contractor progress payments shall be made only in accordance with this paragraph. If a public entity determines that a general contractor in good standing on a project requires a progress payment due for work completed in a workmanlike manner in order to pay a materialman, subcontractor or laborer for their work performed to date, the entity may issue the progress payment upon verification that all materialmen, subcontractors and laborers have been paid for completed work through the date of the most recent previous progress payment, less any contracted amounts lawfully held for retainage. If a progress payment has been withheld by a general contractor due to a reasonable dispute between a general contractor and a materialman or subcontractor, the claimant may present a claim in the disputed amount against the general contractor's surety bond under the provisions of W.S. 16-6-117. A person submitting false information regarding a progress payment subject to this paragraph shall be subject to the provisions of W.S. 16-6-120.</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 31, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(c) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 31, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 31, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(e) Repealed by Laws 2013, Ch. 134, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(f) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Capital construction project" means new construction, demolition, renovation and capital renewal of or to any public building or facility and any other public improvement necessary for the public building or facility, major maintenance as defined in W.S. 16-6-101(a)(v) and major building and facility repair and replacement as defined in W.S. 21-15- 109(a)(iii);</p>

                <p>(a) Any agency which acquires real property for a program or project for which federal financial assistance will be available to pay all or any part of the cost of the program or project shall comply with the following policies:</p>
                <p>(i) Every reasonable effort shall be made to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation;</p>
                <p>(ii) Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his inspection of the property. The agency may prescribe a procedure to waive the appraisal in cases involving the acquisition by sale or donation of property with a low fair market value;</p>
                <p>(iii) Before the initiation of negotiations for real property, an amount shall be established which is reasonably believed to be just compensation therefor, and that amount shall be offered for the property. In no event shall the amount be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property. Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property, prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which the property is acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for the improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, shall be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The owner of the real property to be acquired shall be provided with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount established as just compensation. If appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated;</p>
                <p>(iv) No owner is required to surrender possession of real property before the agreed purchase price is paid or before there is deposited with the court, in accordance with applicable law, for the benefit of the owner, an amount not less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property, or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding of the property;</p>
                <p>(v) The construction or development of a program or project for which federal financial assistance will be available to pay all or any part of the cost of the program or project shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling (assuming a replacement dwelling will be available) or to move his business or farm operation without at least ninety (90) days written notice of the date by which the move is required;</p>
                <p>(vi) If an owner or tenant is permitted to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term or for a period subject to termination by the acquiring agency on short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier;</p>
                <p>(vii) In no event shall the time of condemnation be advanced, or negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner be deferred, or any other action coercive in nature be taken to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property;</p>
                <p>(viii) If an interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, formal condemnation proceedings shall be instituted. The acquiring agency shall not intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his real property;</p>
                <p>(ix) If the acquisition of only a portion of the property would leave the owner with an uneconomic remnant, the agency shall offer to acquire the remnant;</p>
                <p>(x) A person whose real property is being acquired in accordance with this section may, after the person has been fully informed of his right to receive just compensation for the property, donate the property, any part of the property, any interest in the property, or any compensation paid for the property to an agency, as the person shall determine;</p>

                <p>(c) Payment for buildings, structure [structures] or improvements as set forth in this section shall not result in duplication of any payments otherwise authorized by state law. No payment shall be made unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive the tenant of any rights to reject payment and to obtain payment for the property interests in accordance with other laws of the state.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, on and after July 1, 2016, there is imposed a 911 emergency tax of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) on every retail sale of prepaid wireless communications access in Wyoming. The tax shall not be imposed on sales of prepaid wireless communications access intended for resale or upon any state or local governmental entity.</p>
                  <p>(b) A service supplier who sells prepaid wireless communications access shall collect the tax imposed by subsection (a) of this section from each purchaser of prepaid wireless communications access, which purchaser shall be considered a service user. The amount of the tax shall be either separately stated on an invoice, receipt or other similar document that is provided to the service user by the service supplier or shall be otherwise disclosed to the service user.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of this section, a retail sale of prepaid wireless communications access occurs in Wyoming if the transaction would be sourced to Wyoming under W.S. 39-15-104(f)(xi)(C).</p>
                  <p>(d) The tax imposed by subsection (a) of this section is the liability of the service user and the service supplier. The service supplier shall be liable to remit all taxes due or collected as provided in subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the tax collected pursuant to this section is separately stated on an invoice, receipt or similar document provided to the service user by the service supplier, the tax shall not be included in the base for calculating any other tax, fee, surcharge or other charge imposed by this state, any political subdivision of the state or any intergovernmental agency.</p>
                  <p>(f) When prepaid wireless communication access is sold with one (1) or more other products or services for a single, nonitemized price, the tax authorized by subsection (a) of this section shall not be applied to a retail sale of prepaid wireless communications access of ten (10) or fewer minutes or which has a value of five dollars ($5.00) or less.</p>
                  <p>(g) All taxes collected under subsection (a) of this section shall be remitted by the service supplier who collected them to the department of revenue as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) A service supplier shall remit to the department of revenue all monies collected at the times and in the manner provided by W.S. 39-15-107(a). The department of revenue may establish by rule procedures reasonably necessary to facilitate the transfer of these monies. The service supplier shall be subject to the penalty and enforcement provisions provided by W.S. 39-15-108 for any failure to collect or remit funds;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A service supplier remitting collected taxes may deduct and retain three percent (3%) of the taxes collected as the cost of administration for collecting the taxes;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The audit and appeal procedures applicable to the collection of state sales taxes shall apply to the collection and remittance of taxes authorized by this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Pursuant to rules adopted for this purpose, the department of revenue shall establish a procedure by which service suppliers shall document that a transaction is not a retail sale subject to the tax imposed by this section. The procedure shall be substantially similar to the procedure used to document a sale for resale transaction for purposes of sales tax.</p>
                  <p>(h) The monies collected by the department of revenue under this section shall not be general revenues of the state and shall be held by the department in a separate account for distribution as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The department shall deduct one percent (1%) of the total monies collected to cover its administrative expenses and costs, which amount shall be remitted to the treasurer for credit to the general fund;</p>
                  <p>(ii) After deduction of the amount authorized by paragraph (i) of this subsection, the department shall pay all remaining amounts collected to each county that imposes and collects the 911 emergency tax authorized by W.S. 16-9-103;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The payment authorized by paragraph (ii) of this subsection shall be remitted to the county no later than fifteen (15) days after the close of the calendar quarter and is subject to the requirements of paragraph (iv) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Each county receiving payment pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subsection shall receive three percent (3%) of the total amount distributed pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subsection. Each county shall receive the remaining balance of the amount distributed under paragraph (ii) of this subsection in proportion to the percentage that the county’s total population relates to the state’s total population;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a governing body other than a county imposes a 911 emergency tax pursuant to W.S. 16-9-103, the county in which that governing body is located shall divide all monies received by the county pursuant to paragraph (iv) of this subsection equally between the county and the governing body;</p>
                  <p>(vi) All funds received by any governing body pursuant to this subsection shall be expended only for the purposes authorized by W.S. 16-9-105;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Amounts collected by any governing body pursuant to this subsection in excess of necessary expenditures within any fiscal year shall be carried forward to subsequent years and shall be used only for the purposes authorized by W.S. 16-9-105;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The department of revenue may promulgate rules necessary to implement this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(j) The department of revenue and the Wyoming public service commission shall jointly report to the joint corporations, elections and political subdivisions committee on or before July 1, 2019 and every four (4) years thereafter. The report required by this subsection shall contain an analysis of the tax rate imposed by subsection (a) of this section and shall determine whether that tax rate places a tax burden on purchasers of prepaid wireless communication access which is substantially equivalent to the tax burden imposed by W.S. 16-9-103(b). If the tax burden imposed by this section is not substantially equivalent to the tax burden imposed by W.S. 16-9-103(b), the department and the commission shall advise the committee on the tax rate that would make the burden imposed by the two (2) taxes equivalent. The department of revenue and the Wyoming public service commission may adopt rules requiring the reporting of sales data or other information necessary to complete the analysis required by this subsection.</p>
