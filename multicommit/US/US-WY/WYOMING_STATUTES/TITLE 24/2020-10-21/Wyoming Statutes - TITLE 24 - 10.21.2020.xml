                <p><shortTitle>24-1-101. Public highways defined and established; creation by adverse possession.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) On and after January 1, 1924, all roads within this state shall be highways, which have been or may be declared by law to be state or county highways. It shall be the duty of the several boards of county commissioners, within their respective counties, prior to said date, to determine what, if any, such roads now or heretofore traveled but not heretofore officially established and recorded, are necessary or important for the public use as permanent roads, and to cause such roads to be recorded, or if need be laid out, established and recorded, and all roads recorded as aforesaid, shall be highways. No other roads, except roads located on federal public lands prior to October, 1976 which provide access for a private residence or agricultural operation shall be highways upon acceptance by the board of county commissioners of the county where the road is located, shall be highways unless and until lawfully established as such by official authority. Except, nothing contained herein shall be construed as preventing the creation or establishment of a public highway right-of-way with reference to state and county highways under the common-law doctrines of adverse possession or prescription either prior to or subsequent to the enactment hereof. If any such board shall resolve the creation or establishment of a public highway right-of-way based upon the common-law doctrines of adverse possession or prescription, it shall, following the filing of a plat and accurate survey required in accordance with the terms and provisions of W.S. 24-3-109, proceed with the publication of the proposed road for three (3) successive weeks in three (3) successive issues of some official newspaper published in the county, if any such there be, and if no newspaper be published therein, such notice shall be posted in at least three (3) public places along the line of the proposed road, which notice shall be exclusive of all other notices and may be in the following form:</p>
                <p>To all whom it may concern: The board of county commissioners of .... county has resolved the creation and establishment of a public highway right-of-way under the common-law doctrine of prescription in that the road was constructed or substantially maintained by the (either the state or county) for general public use for a period of (ten years or longer) said road commencing at .... in .... county, Wyoming, running thence (here describe in general terms the points and courses thereof), and terminating at .... All objections thereto must be filed in writing with the county clerk of said county before noon on the .... day of........... A.D., ...., or such road will be established without reference to such objections.</p>
                <p>....</p>
                <p>County Clerk</p>
                <p>Dated.......... A.D.</p>
                <p>(b) The county commissioners shall cause a copy of the above notice to be mailed by registered or certified mail to all persons owning lands or claiming any interest in any lands over or across which the road is proposed to be created or established. The publication, posting and mailings of such notice shall be a legal and sufficient notice to all persons owning lands or claiming any interest in lands over which the proposed road is to be created or established. No viewers or appraisers shall be appointed, nor shall any damage claims be considered or heard, and the sole objections to be heard by the board shall be directed against the creation or establishment of such right-of-way under the common-law doctrines of adverse possession or prescription. Any objector may appeal from the final decision of the board of the county commissioners to the district court of the county in which the land is situated. Notice of such appeal must be made to the county clerk within thirty (30) days after such decision has been made by the board, or such claim shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Within ten (10) days after the notice of an appeal is filed in his office, the county clerk shall make out and file in the office of the clerk of the district court, in his county, a transcript of the papers on file in his office, and the proceedings of the board in relation to such creation and establishment. The proceedings on appeal shall be governed by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. If the appeal is upheld the appellant shall be reimbursed by the county for all reasonable costs of asserting his claim.</p>
                <p>(c) Only that portion of the state highways actually used, travelled or fenced, which has been used by the general public for a period of ten (10) years or longer, either prior to or subsequent to the enactment hereof, shall be presumed to be public highways lawfully established as such by official authority and unavailability of records to show such to have been lawfully established shall not rebut this presumption.</p>
                <p>(d) Only that portion of county highways, not to exceed sixty-six (66) feet in width, which was actually constructed or substantially maintained by the county and travelled and used by the general public for a period of ten (10) years or longer, either prior to or subsequent to the enactment hereof, shall be presumed to be public highways lawfully established as such by official authority.</p>

Said board of county commissioners shall take into consideration the climate, soil, and materials to be had in the vicinity, and the extent and nature of the probable traffic on said highway with a view to the most economical construction thereof consistent with efficiency. The expense of locating, surveying, and constructing such county highways shall be paid by the county in which such highway is constructed.</p>

                <p>(a) The department of transportation may restrict the use of, or close, any state highway whenever the department considers the closing or restriction of use necessary:</p>
                <p>(i) For the protection of the public;</p>
                <p>(ii) For the protection of the highway from damage during storms or during construction, improvement or maintenance operations thereon; or</p>
                <p>(iii) For a special event or athletic event pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
                <p>(b) The department of transportation may authorize the complete or partial closure of designated portions of any state highway for the purpose of conducting a special event or athletic event. The director of the department may use equipment and personnel as necessary. The closure may be authorized only if:</p>
                <p>(i) A written application for the event is submitted to the department, containing information the department deems necessary and the application is approved by the director;</p>
                <p>(ii) A county government approves the closure if the closure would restrict the use of any county road in the unincorporated area of the county; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The closure is implemented in a manner consistent with the rules and regulations of the department and will cause the least inconvenience to the driving public consistent with the requirements of the special event or athletic event.</p>

                <p>(i) "Special event" or "athletic event" means any event which is held outside the corporate limits of any city or town on a state highway but cannot comply with all applicable traffic statutes or ordinances. This shall include, but not be limited to, parades, fairs, exhibitions, motion picture filming, bicycle races and foot races. This definition does not include an event taking place away from a highway which, due to the number of persons attending the event, creates traffic congestion on a highway before and after the event; and</p>
                <p>(ii) "Partial or complete closure of designated portions of any state highway" means the closing to traffic of any roadway, lane or other portion of a state roadway or highway or any other restriction of the normal use of a highway.</p>

Within ninety (90) days of the bridge being opened to traffic the board of county commissioners or governing body of the city or town shall notify and provide the design, plans, specifications and load rating for the bridge to the chief engineer of the department of transportation so that the department may comply with national bridge inspection standards.</p>
                <p>(g) Whenever an emergency arises requiring expenditure of funds for the repair or rebuilding of bridges or approaches to bridges the board of county commissioners or governing body of any city or town may enter into contract for any building or rebuilding of bridges or approaches without advertising for the letting of any contract. An emergency is an occasion requiring repair or rebuilding of a bridge or a portion of a bridge when, on short notice, the bridge has become unsafe or impassable due to events which are beyond the control of the county, city or town.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>24-1-133. Posting notice of restrictions to public roads and adjacent lands; restrictions; penalties.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) No person shall post a notice purporting to restrict access over a public road unless the restriction has been approved by the governing body having jurisdiction over the road.</p>
                <p>(b) For purposes of this section "public road" means any passageway to which there is a duly recorded instrument from the landowner or his predecessor in interest conveying to the public unrestricted legal right to use the passageway or to which a governing body has acquired unrestricted legal right for the public to use the passageway.</p>
                <p>(c) The governing body or its authorized representative having jurisdiction over the public road shall issue a written demand to any person who unlawfully posts a notice in violation of subsection (a) of this section directing that the notice be removed within three (3) days following receipt of the notice. The demand shall be delivered in person by a peace officer or mailed by both first class mail and certified mail return receipt requested to the person's last known mailing address. Any person who knowingly posts an illegal notice or who fails to remove an illegal notice within three (3) days after receiving the demand from the governing body is guilty of a misdemeanor. If the person cannot be personally served because he deliberately made himself unavailable for service, or refused to accept delivery of the demand by certified mail, then he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor if he fails to remove the illegal notice within five (5) days after the demand was mailed to him by the governing body. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under this section shall be punished by a fine up to six hundred dollars ($600.00) for each day the person fails to remove the illegal notice. For a second or subsequent offense, the penalty shall be a fine of not more than six hundred dollars ($600.00) per day, and up to six (6) months in jail, or both.</p>
                <p>(d) It shall be a defense to any charge under this section, that severe weather or other circumstance not within control of the person charged prevented removal of the notice.</p>

                <p>(a) The transportation commission shall designate public highways to be known as state highways, which may coincide in whole or in part with previously established county roads. When the state highway is defined and designated by resolution entered in the records of the commission, all title and interest of the respective counties, in the road and right-of-way designated, shall pass to and vest in the transportation commission of Wyoming.</p>

                <p>(a) The board of county commissioners of each county shall establish a separate road construction and maintenance fund solely for the construction and maintenance of county roads, bridges and culverts. Work using funds from the road construction and maintenance fund of a county shall be performed under contract awarded after competitive bidding if the estimated cost of the work exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). All work shall be performed under the immediate control and supervision of the board of county commissioners or its authorized representative and in accordance with county road standards as established by the Wyoming county road standards committee. The road construction and maintenance fund program is a supplement to federal aid, primary and secondary road programs in each county. The term "construction and maintenance" as used in this section means construction, reconstruction, surveys, mapping, right-of-way costs, bridges, culverts, general road maintenance and fencing. The county shall use existing grades, bridges and other physical items or facilities in order to minimize or avoid more costly relocation.</p>
                <p>(b) All expenses of maintaining the road after its construction is completed shall be paid by the county.</p>
                <p>(c) The gasoline license tax revenues distributed by the department of transportation under W.S. 39-17-111(d)(ii) shall be sent to the county treasurers of the various counties and placed in a separate fund in each county earning its own interest and be expended by the board of county commissioners solely for the road construction and maintenance fund program and as otherwise provided in this subsection. This money shall be allocated as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) To the highway fund, an amount equal to the counties' contribution for the cost of the university's technology transfer program under W.S. 21-17-115(a)(ii) or thirty-one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($31,250.00), whichever is less;</p>
                <p>(ii) The remainder to the counties and the share allocated to each county shall be based fifty percent (50%) upon the percentage ratio which the rural population including the population within the cities and towns with less than one thousand four hundred (1,400) of each county bears to the total rural population of the state and fifty percent (50%) based upon the percentage ratio which the area of each county bears to the area of the state. Any interest earned on the investment of monies in the fund created by this subsection shall be retained by each county and shall be used for project costs as authorized by this section.</p>
                <p>(d) Repealed by Laws 2008, Ch. 24, § 2.</p>
                <p>(e) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 170, § 2.</p>
                <p>(f) There is created a Wyoming county road standards committee appointed by the governor consisting of:</p>
                <p>(i) Three (3) members nominated by the Wyoming county commissioners association, one (1) of whom shall be a registered professional engineer;</p>
                <p>(ii) Two (2) members nominated by the Wyoming association of consulting engineers and surveyors;</p>
                <p>(iii) One (1) member nominated by the Wyoming contractors association; and</p>
                <p>(iv) One (1) member nominated by the Wyoming association of county engineers and road superintendents.</p>
                <p>(g) It shall be the responsibility of the Wyoming county roads standards committee to furnish standards for the construction and maintenance of county roads to any board of county commissioners upon request, and to advise boards of county commissioners with respect to highway construction, maintenance and improvements. The committee shall meet as necessary, but at least annually.</p>
                <p>(h) Whenever an emergency arises requiring construction or maintenance work using funds from the road construction and maintenance fund of a county, the board of county commissioners may enter into contract for the work without advertising for the letting of the contract. An emergency is an occasion requiring construction or maintenance work, on short notice, because the road has become unsafe or impassable due to events which are beyond the control of the county.</p>

                <p>(a) The transportation commission may cooperate with incorporated cities and towns in the construction of public streets and highways, including bridges and culverts, but excepting bypass routes, if the streets or highways constitute direct connections between sections of established state highways. All cooperative work shall be performed under the immediate control and supervision of the director of the department of transportation in accordance with plans and specifications prepared under the supervision of the director or the chief engineer, but no contract shall be let nor work commenced until sixty (60) days after the plans for the work have been submitted and approved by the legislative body of the incorporated city or town. The failure of the legislative body of the incorporated city or town to take official action approving or disapproving the plans within sixty (60) days shall constitute approval for the purpose of this section. The entire cost of construction of the streets and highways and the maintenance, including streets and highways currently in existence, shall be paid by the transportation commission with the following exceptions:</p>
                <p>(i) The cost of construction of storm sewers along streets designated as state highways shall be paid by the transportation commission. If the city decides to connect other storm sewers with the one constructed by the commission, the commission shall only pay for the cost of a storm sewer needed to provide drainage for the street. If additional costs are incurred, the cities shall pay these additional costs. The city or town, if the population is over fifteen hundred (1,500) or more, shall pay all costs of, and be responsible for, the cleaning and maintenance of the storm sewers;</p>
                <p>(ii) The city or town, if it has a population of fifteen hundred (1,500) or more, shall pay all costs of, and be responsible for, the cleaning, sweeping and washing of, and snow removal from the streets and highways. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the transportation commission may contribute financial assistance to any city or town with a population between fifteen hundred (1,500) and five thousand (5,000) that is performing its duties under this paragraph in a total amount not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00) per capita annually to the city or town;</p>
                <p>(iii) The entire cost to the state of the construction, maintenance and acquisition of the necessary right-of-way for any highway route, which constitutes a bypass of any incorporated city or town, and which is constructed for the purpose of satisfying the highway construction standards established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and approved by the federal highway administration including access control, regardless whether any portion lies within the corporate limits of any city or town, shall be paid by the transportation commission.</p>

                <p>The legislature of the state of Wyoming assents to the provisions of the act of congress approved July 11, 1916, entitled "an act to provide that the United States shall aid the states in the construction of rural post roads, and for other purposes," together with all acts and legislation, amendatory or supplementary, or which shall grant or authorize aid for the construction, improvement, maintenance or repair of public roads or highways. The transportation commission is authorized to enter into all contracts and agreements with the United States government relating to the construction and maintenance of roads under the provisions of the act or acts of congress to submit the scheme or program or construction or maintenance as may be required by the federal highway administration and to do all other things necessary fully to carry out the cooperation contemplated and provided for by the act or acts, for the construction or improvement of highways under the act, the good faith of the state is pledged to make available funds sufficient to equal the sums apportioned to the state by or under the United States government during each of the years for which federal funds are appropriated by section 3 of the act and to maintain the roads so constructed with the aid of funds appropriated and to make adequate provisions for carrying out maintenance. Cooperative agreements under the provisions of the act shall be entered into with the federal highway administration only by the commission, but may be for the construction or improvement of either a state highway or a county road. If the road to be improved under such cooperative agreement is a state highway, the state's share of the expense shall be borne entirely by the state; if the highway to be improved or constructed under such cooperative agreement is not a state highway, the state's share of the cost of the work shall be divided between the state and the county upon such basis as the commission shall determine, and before an agreement is entered into with the federal highway administration the county must furnish the right-of-way and shall have entered into an agreement with the commission whereby it shall agree to pay its share of the cost and to pay the cost of all subsequent maintenance, work which shall be performed by and under the supervision of the director of the department of transportation, and the county also shall pay into the state highway fund its share of the estimated cost of the construction.</p>

                  <p>(a) The transportation commission may abandon or relinquish any portion of state highways upon the reconstruction or relocation of any portion of an existing state highway.</p>
                  <p>(b) Prior to abandonment of any portion of a state highway, the transportation commission shall offer the highway to the governing body of any county or city in which the highway is located. Upon being notified of the transportation commission's intent to abandon any portion of a state highway, the governing body of the county or city shall comply with the procedures provided for in paragraph (c)(ii) of this section in order to initiate transfer of the state highway.</p>
                  <p>(c) The abandonment or relinquishment of any portion of state highways shall be conclusively evidenced by the resolution entered in the minute record of the commission. A certified copy of the resolution shall be recorded by the secretary of the transportation commission in the office of the county clerk of any county in which abandoned or relinquished highway right-of-way is located. Abandonment or relinquishment shall not affect the rights of corporations or their successors in interest acquired under the provisions of W.S. 1-26-813 to continue the operation and maintenance of transmission and distribution lines constructed upon the right-of-way and shall not affect the rights of any corporation or successors in interest to continue to maintain any facility lawfully in the highway right-of-way at the time of any abandonment or relinquishment. Corporations shall have the right to go upon these lands for the purposes associated with maintenance or use of their facility. Specific rules regarding relinquishment and abandonment are:</p>
                  <p>(i) Upon the entry of the resolution of abandonment in the minute record of the commission, all title and interest, except as herein provided, to the highway right-of-way shall pass to and vest in the present adjacent landowner according to the portion contributed by adjacent landowner or his predecessor in interest;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Instead of abandonment, the transportation commission may, upon written request, relinquish to any county or city any portion of a state highway within the county or city proposed to be removed from the state highway system. The request shall be in the form of a resolution adopted by the governing body of the county or city, indicating that the portion of the state highway sought by the governing body will be used for a local public purpose enumerated in the resolution and expressing the agreement of the county or city to assume all responsibility with regard thereto. Relinquishment by the transportation commission shall be by entry of the resolution of relinquishment in the minute record of the commission and by quitclaim deed effective upon recordation in the office of the county clerk and recorder of any county in which the real property is located.</p>

                  <p>The legislature finds that due to inaccurate and inconsistent records, there exist roads which are seldom used, not maintained and are not identified as or believed by the public to be county roads but are, in fact, county roads. Recognizing the numerous difficulties resulting from the existence of such county roads, the legislature finds it in the best interest of the public to create a procedure to identify county roads, thereby altering and vacating these abandoned or unnecessary county roads without survey.</p>

                <p>(b) In any incorporated city or town when the decision is to be made, the proposal to move or relocate a highway shall be submitted at any regular or special election in the municipality to the qualified electors thereof. The ballot question shall set forth a concise and accurate summary of the proposed change and shall permit and direct each voter to vote either "For the Proposed Change" or "Against the Proposed Change".

                <p>(a) Any person whose land has no outlet to, nor connection with a public road, may commence an action in district court in any county in which any part of the land is located for a private road leading from his land to some convenient public road. The plaintiff shall join as defendants the owners of record, owners of recorded easements and rights of way and any lessee, mortgagee or occupant of the land over which any proposed road would cross. The complaint shall contain a short and plain statement of:</p>
                <p>(i) The legal description of the land owned by the plaintiff to which access is sought and a statement that all or some of the land is located within the county;</p>
                <p>(ii) A specific statement as to why the land has no legally enforceable access, other than a waterway, and whether the land is surrounded on all sides by land owned by another person or persons or a natural or man-made barrier making access unreasonably costly;</p>
                <p>(iii) A description of the plaintiff's efforts to purchase a legally enforceable access to a public road;</p>
                <p>(iv) A description sufficient to identify the general location of any access routes proposed by the plaintiff;</p>
                <p>(v) The legal description of all land over which any proposed access routes would cross; and</p>
                <p>(vi) A statement as to whether any actions of the plaintiff or any person with the consent and knowledge of the plaintiff, caused the plaintiff's land to lose or to not have any legally enforceable access.</p>
                <p>(b) The defendant's answer shall set forth the location and description, in the manner described in paragraphs (a)(iv) and (v) of this section, of any alternate routes proposed by the defendant and the owners of record, owners of recorded easements and rights of way and any lessee, mortgagee or occupant of the land over which any proposed alternate routes would cross.</p>
                <p>(c) The court shall give an action for a private road precedence over other civil cases pending in court, other than election contests, and the action shall in every way be expedited.</p>
                <p>(d) If the plaintiff has had access to his land and that access is being denied or restricted, the court may grant temporary access to the plaintiff over a route identified by the court pending the outcome of the proceedings.</p>
                <p>(e) The plaintiff shall join as defendants persons identified under subsection (b) of this section or otherwise identified by a defendant as the owners of record, owners of recorded easements and rights of way and any lessee, mortgagee or occupant of the land over which any proposed alternative routes would cross.</p>
                <p>(f) The court may require the plaintiff to file a bond to pay for costs allowed under W.S. 24-9-103.</p>
                <p>(g) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 99, § 3.</p>
                <p>(h) The court shall hold an initial hearing to determine whether the plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of this section and access is necessary because the plaintiff has no legally enforceable access. If the court finds the requirements of this section have been met and access is necessary, the court shall appoint three (3) disinterested persons as viewers and appraisers. Before entering upon their duties the viewers shall take and subscribe to an oath that they will faithfully and impartially perform their duties under their appointment as viewers and appraisers. The court shall direct them to meet on a day named in the order on the proposed road, and view and appraise any damages, at which time and place all persons interested may appear and be heard by the viewers. The viewers and appraisers shall then proceed to locate and mark out a private road and alternative routes as they deem appropriate, provided the location of the road shall not be marked out to cross the lands of any person not joined in the action. The viewers and appraisers shall recommend to the court the most reasonable and convenient route, provided that access shall be along section and boundary lines whenever practical. The viewers and appraisers may recommend specific conditions that the court place on the road, including provisions for maintenance and limitations on the amount and type of use. The proposed road shall not exceed thirty (30) feet in width from a certain point on the land of the plaintiff to some certain point on the public road, and shall be located so as to do the least possible damage to the lands through which the private road is located. The viewers and appraisers shall also appraise any damages sustained by the owner over which the road is to be established and make full and true returns, with a plat of the road to the court. The viewers and appraisers shall also determine whether or not any gates or cattleguards should be placed at proper points on the road, and appraise any damages in accordance with that determination.</p>
                <p>(j) In determining any damages to be suffered by a defendant, the viewers and appraisers shall appraise the value of the property affected by the road before and after the road is in place. Damages also may include reasonable compensation for any improvements on the lands over which any private road is to be granted which were not paid for and will be used by the plaintiff.</p>
