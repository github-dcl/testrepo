So help me God.";</p>
                  <p>(viii) Immediately after the taxes are levied each year make the tax list in tabular form and in alphabetical order upon the form and in the manner prescribed by law;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>18-3-501. Composition; election for increasing the number; term; quorum; election for districting; procedures.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Each board of county commissioners shall consist of three (3) qualified electors who shall be elected in the following manner: at the general election held in the year 1980 and every fourth year thereafter, there shall be elected one (1) commissioner for a term of four (4) years and at the general election held in the year of 1978 and every fourth year thereafter there shall be elected two (2) commissioners for a term of four (4) years each. Any two (2) members of the board constitute a quorum and are competent to act.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, any county may increase the membership of its board of county commissioners from three (3) to five (5) members if a proposition for the increase is submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the county and a majority of those casting their ballots vote in favor of the increase. Additional offices created under this subsection shall be filled at the general election next following the election at which the increase was approved. At that general election, not more than one (1) commissioner shall be elected for a term of two (2) years, and the election ballots shall so state. Each term shall otherwise be four (4) years.</p>
                  <p>(c) The proposition to increase the membership of the board of county commissioners shall be at the expense of the county and be submitted to the electors of the county upon receipt by the county clerk of a petition requesting the election signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the qualified electors of the county. To be counted the electors shall be registered voters when the completed petition is submitted for verification. The number of electors required shall be determined by the number of votes cast at the last general election. The election shall be at the direction and under the supervision of the county clerk. The petition shall be in substantially the following form:</p>
                  <p>"This petition is for the purpose of requesting an election to increase the membership of the board of county commissioners from three (3) to five (5) members. If a proposition for the increase is submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the county and a majority of those casting their ballots vote in favor of the increase, the additional offices created shall be filled at the general election held in (year).</p>
                  <p>The eligible registered electors supporting the petition and numbering not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of votes cast at the last general election in the county for which this petition is filed, are as follows:</p>
                  <p>(Signature) (Printed Name) (Residence Address) (Date)</p>
                  <p>VERIFICATION OF CIRCULATORS</p>
                  <p>I, .... do hereby certify that I am a circulator of this petition, and I solely and personally circulated this petition, that all the signatures appearing herein were made in my presence from (month)_(day), (year) through (month) (day), (year), and to the best of my knowledge and belief such signatures are those of the persons whose names they purport to be.</p>
                  <p>(Signature) (Residence Address)"</p>
                  <p>(d) The proposition may be submitted at any general election. A notice of election shall be given in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation published in the county wherein the election is to be held and shall specify the object of the election. The notice shall be published at least once each week for a thirty (30) day period preceding the election. At the election the ballots shall contain the words "for increasing the membership of the board of county commissioners from three (3) to five (5) members", and "against increasing the membership of the board of county commissioners from three (3) to five (5) members".</p>
                  <p>(e) If a county votes to increase the membership of its board of county commissioners under subsection (b) of this section, three (3) members of the board constitute a quorum and are competent to act.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any county may decrease the membership of its board of county commissioners from five (5) to three (3) members in the same petition and proposition process as an increase under subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The vote to decrease membership shall be in the general election preceding the election of three (3) commissioners. Notice of the election shall be given as provided in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any county in which the electors vote to increase the number of county commissioners from three (3) to five (5) as provided by this section may be divided into five (5) districts if a proposition for districting is submitted to a vote of the qualified electorate of the county and a majority of those casting their ballots vote in favor of the districting. The proposition for districting shall be submitted to a vote in the manner provided by subsections (c) and (d) of this section. At the election, the ballot shall contain the words "for dividing the county into five (5) county commissioner election districts" and "against dividing the county into five (5) county commissioner election districts". The proposition to increase the number of county commissioners and the proposition for districting may appear on the ballot at the same general election, however the ballots shall state that the proposition for districting is contingent upon approval of the proposition to increase the number of commissioners. The petition required by subsection (c) of this section may contain both the proposition to increase the number of commissioners and the proposition for districting, or the propositions may be circulated and submitted on separate petitions. If the proposition for districting is not approved, the commissioners shall represent the county on at-large basis.</p>
                  <p>(h) If the proposition for districting is approved, the board of county commissioners shall devise a districting plan dividing the county into districts as nearly equal in population as practicable considering the geographic, economic and social characteristics of the county. The districting plan shall be made before March 1 next following the election at which the proposition for districting is approved and shall be effective as of March 1 the following year. The districting plan may provide that any commissioner elected after the effective date of the districting plan shall reside in and represent the district from which he is elected by the electors of that district, and, beginning January 1, 2012, that commissioners may serve at large or that district representation may be apportioned in any combination of single member, multi- member and at large representation, provided that in all cases commissioners represent a population as nearly equal as is practicable considering the geographic, economic and social characteristics of the county. Commissioners in office on the effective date of the districting plan shall serve the county at large until the regular expiration of their term. The districting plan shall designate which districts shall elect county commissioners in the general election next following the effective date of the districting plan. In any county in which the voters approved increasing the number of commissioners and districting at the same election, the districting plan shall also designate which district shall elect a county commissioner at the next general election for a term of two (2) years, as provided by subsection (b) of this section. The ballot shall state the term in the designated district to be for two (2) years. Thereafter, all terms shall be four (4) years.</p>
                  <p>(j) Appeals from the actions of the boards of county commissioners shall be as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(k) If required to do so pursuant to a final court order or changes in population affecting the constitutionality of a current districting plan, the board of county commissioners may by resolution devise a districting or redistricting plan dividing the county into any number of districts necessary to meet the requirements of the court order or necessary to address the population changes. A districting or redistricting plan devised under this subsection may include single member or multi-member districts in which the candidates must reside and which are apportioned by population, districts in which candidates are elected at large, or any combination of districts in which candidates must reside and are apportioned by population or are elected at large provided that in all cases commissioners represent a population as nearly equal as is practicable considering the geographic, economic and social characteristics of the county. A districting or redistricting plan created under this subsection shall not be subject to a vote of the electors and shall go into effect after the next general election and shall be subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) An initial districting plan created under this subsection shall provide for at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the commissioners to serve an initial term of two (2) years and the remainder to serve an initial term of four (4) years. Thereafter, all terms shall be four (4) years. The terms of all commissioners serving at the time of the approval of the districting plan shall expire at the end of the current year and all offices created under this subsection shall be filled at the general election held on the effective date of the districting plan;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For a redistricting plan, commissioners in office on the effective date of the districting plan shall serve the county at large until the regular expiration of their term, if practical. The county commission shall determine whether honoring the four (4) year terms is practical.</p>

                  <p>(e) The acceptance of negotiable paper constitutes conditional payment for the amount owing. If the paper is not dishonored the payment shall be effective on the date the paper was accepted by the county officer, agent or employee. If the paper is dishonored in the course of collection the conditional payment is of no effect and any receipt, certificate or license issued upon acceptance of the negotiable paper is void. In the event any property including motor vehicle license plates is transferred or issued by the county or any of its officers, agents or employees upon acceptance of negotiable paper, and the paper is subsequently dishonored the county may rescind the transaction and a sheriff or other law enforcement officer may without prior court proceedings seize the property. Neither the rescission nor seizure relieves the person presenting the negotiable paper from further civil or criminal liabilities as may be provided by law.</p>

                  <p>(a) All claims and demands against a county shall be presented for audit and allowance to the board of county commissioners before any action in court is maintainable. All claims when allowed shall be paid by a county warrant or order drawn by the board on the county treasurer upon the proper funds in the treasury for the amount of the claims. The warrant or order shall be signed by the permanent or temporary chairman of the board, attested by the county clerk under the seal of the county, and countersigned and registered by the county treasurer. The warrant or order shall specify the amount of the claim or service and be numbered and dated in the order in which it is issued. Such warrants and orders are payable on demand and shall be drawn and issued upon the county treasurer only when there are sufficient monies in the appropriate fund in the treasury to pay such warrants and orders.</p>
                  <p>(b) Whenever there are no monies in the proper fund of the county treasury to meet the necessary expenses of the county, the board of county commissioners may authorize county warrants and orders to be drawn and issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes already levied. The aggregate amount of such warrants or orders may not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the total amount of taxes levied. The warrants and orders so drawn and issued shall show that they are payable solely from the fund on which they are drawn and the taxes levied to form the fund when collected. These warrants and orders do not increase the indebtedness of the county.</p>
                  <p>(c) County warrants and orders may be in such form as the county commissioners provide and made payable to the order of the payee or bearer. The person or persons to whom the warrants and orders are allowed and delivered are held to have accepted the same in full payment and satisfaction of the claim for which it was issued. The warrants shall be paid only from the fund drawn upon, and the collected taxes paid into the county treasury to create, constitute and form the fund. The taxes provided by law shall be paid into the fund until all warrants drawn are fully paid including principal and interest.</p>

                  <p>(iii) He shall make a map or plat of the survey and record a copy of it together with a copy of the field notes, applications for survey, notice to and names of the interested parties and all other pertinent papers in the office of the county surveyor and county clerk in the county in which the land is located. He shall file a copy of the same papers in the public survey office, department of the interior, Cheyenne, Wyoming. The monument or monuments reestablished or restored shall be held to mark the original corner or corners and shall have the legal force and effect as stated in the original record of the survey;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>18-3-902. Governor to direct district attorney or attorney general to commence action; petition served with summons; pleading; trial; judgment; change of judge.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Whenever it appears to the governor on the verified complaint of qualified electors or the board of county commissioners of the county that any county officer is guilty of misconduct or malfeasance in office he may direct the attorney general to commence and prosecute an action in the district court of the county in which the officer is an official asking for the removal of the officer. The action shall be commenced by the filing of a verified petition in the name of the state of Wyoming signed by the attorney general setting forth the facts constituting the misconduct or malfeasance in office.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon filing of the petition a summons and a copy of the petition shall be served on the defendant as in civil cases. The answer day shall be the same as provided for civil suits. The petition and answer are the only pleadings allowed and the allegations of the answer so far as they conflict with the petition shall be considered denied without a reply.</p>
                  <p>(c) The action shall be tried in a summary manner by the district court with or without a jury not less than five (5) days nor more than thirty (30) days after answer day. At the trial all questions touching the sufficiency or certainty of the allegations of the petition or answer shall be heard and determined and amendments which are not inconsistent with the original pleadings shall be authorized to be made at once and shall not delay the trial. If the court finds the defendant is guilty of misconduct or malfeasance in office as charged in the petition, a judgment shall be entered removing the defendant from office and taxing against him the costs of the action.</p>
                  <p>(d) The judge of a district court in which an action for the removal of an officer is pending, if unable to try the action within the period provided by this section, shall call in another district judge.</p>
                  <p>(e) No change of judge is allowed unless proper application therefor is filed with the answer but if the judge of that district is unable to try the action and has designated another district judge to try the same, the application must be filed within three (3) days after the filing of the order designating the judge to whom the action is referred.</p>
                  <p>(f) As used in this section, "misconduct or malfeasance" includes, but is not limited to, instances when:</p>
                  <p>(i) The officer absents himself from his office for an aggregate of sixty (60) days in any three (3) month period unless such absence is caused by illness or other disability;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The officer is absent from his office for more than ninety (90) days because of illness or other disability and the illness or disability will probably not terminate during the unexpired portion of the officer's term of office.</p>
                  <p>(g) Whenever a vacancy occurs in any county office under the provisions of this section, it shall be filled as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(h) This section is supplemental to all other statutes concerning removal of county officers.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever a proceeding as specified by W.S. 18-3-902 has been commenced in the district court, the governor may cause notice to be served upon the accused officer setting forth the misconduct or malfeasance in office as charged in the petition and requiring the officer to appear before him at a designated time and place not less than five (5) days after service of the notice. The governor shall hear the charges against and the defense of the officer, which may be presented by affidavits or otherwise. If the governor determines that the officer is guilty of misconduct or malfeasance in office he may by an order signed by him and filed in the office of the secretary of state, suspend the officer from the further exercise of his duties until the termination of the trial of such officer as provided by W.S. 18-3-902. Duplicate copies of the order of suspension shall be filed in the offices of the county clerk and the clerk of the district court of the county in which the accused is an officer.</p>
                  <p>(b) Whenever any county officer is suspended as provided by this section the person or board having authority to fill vacancies in the office shall appoint some qualified elector to temporarily fill the office and perform the duties thereof so long as the suspension continues. If the officer suspended is a county commissioner the governor shall appoint some qualified elector to temporarily fill the office and perform the duties thereof so long as the suspension continues. Whenever any officer is removed by a final judgment entered in such proceeding the vacancy shall be filled as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any county officer who has been suspended under the provisions of this section and who is found by the district court to be not guilty of the misconduct or malfeasance in office charged against him shall be restored to his office and shall receive the compensation provided for the office during the period of his suspension. He shall be reimbursed by the state of Wyoming for all actual and necessary expenditures made by him in connection with all trials and hearings provided for in this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) When there are insufficient funds in the county treasury to meet the current obligations of the county each board of county commissioners may issue certificates of indebtedness for current expenses of the county and particularly for maintaining courts, boarding prisoners, prosecution of criminals and salaries of county officers.</p>
                  <p>(b) With the permission of the board of county commissioners, the county hospital, library, welfare or fair board may issue certificates of indebtedness in cases where there are insufficient funds in the county treasury to meet their current obligations for the necessary expenses for continuing the services and functions for which the boards are responsible and the expenses of the boards during July through November.</p>
                  <p>(c) The certificates of indebtedness shall bear interest at not more than six percent (6%) per annum payable from the funds of the board issuing the certificate. The total amount of certificates issued by each of the boards shall not exceed the following amounts in any one (1) year:</p>
                  <p>(i) For county hospitals, thirty percent (30%) of that portion of the budget approved by the board of county commissioners to be derived from tax levies during the current year;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For county fairs, eighty percent (80%) of the budget estimate of anticipated income for the year of issuance;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For county libraries, thirty percent (30%) of the budget estimate of anticipated income for the year of issuance;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For welfare boards, fifty percent (50%) of that portion of the budget for general welfare and health approved by the board of county commissioners to be derived from tax levies during the current year.</p>
                  <p>(d) The provisions of this section do not give authority to any of the boards to spend in excess of their total budgeted expenditures as approved according to law.</p>
                  <p>(e) Certificates are issuable by the board of county commissioners and by the county hospital, library, welfare or fair boards even though there may be a balance in the cash reserve fund of each of the boards.</p>
                  <p>(f) The certificates of indebtedness shall be payable out of the taxes levied and collected for the current year for use of the boards and shall be paid out of the first tax funds available to each board. They shall state they are payable out of the revenues of the county for the year of issuance and shall be clearly distinguishable from county orders or warrants.</p>
                  <p>(g) When county hospital, library, welfare or fair boards resolve to issue the certificates they shall forward to the county treasurer a copy of the resolution, certified by the presiding officer of the board, setting forth the number and amount of all such certificates to be issued.</p>
                  <p>(h) The certificates of indebtedness are a first and prior charge upon the taxes collected for the year of their issuance, and shall be first paid out of funds in the county treasury derived from taxes, fines or other sources of revenue collected or paid into the county treasury during the year of issuance, excluding sums received for delinquent taxes or fines for any previous year.</p>
                  <p>(j) The term "current year" as used in this section means the year commencing at twelve (12:00) noon on the preceding first Monday of January and ending at the same hour on the first Monday of the following January.</p>

                  <p>(a) Each board of county commissioners shall give notice by publication in some newspaper published in the county if there be one otherwise by three (3) notices posted in the county, one (1) of which is at the courthouse door, of its intention to issue and negotiate the bonds and invite bidders therefor. The notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Cheyenne.</p>
                  <p>(b) After ascertaining the best terms and the lowest interest at which the bonds can be negotiated the board of county commissioners shall secure the proper engraving and printing, have them consecutively numbered and otherwise properly prepared and executed.</p>
                  <p>(c) When the bonds are executed they shall be registered by the county clerk in a public record book kept for that purpose and therein shall be stated showing the number, date, amount of bond, time and place of payment, rate of interest, number of coupons attached and any other description for future identification. The board of county commissioners shall from time to time and in such amounts as it deems proper, deliver the bonds to the county treasurer and take and file his receipt therefor and charge him with all bonds so delivered.</p>

                  <p>(e) The treasurer under the general supervision of the board shall sell the bonds for cash or exchange them for any county indebtedness for the redemption of which they were issued, but shall not sell or exchange the bonds for less than their face or par value and the accrued interest at the time of their disposal. No county indebtedness shall be redeemed at more than its face value and any interest that may be due thereon. If any portion of the bonds are sold for money the proceeds shall be applied exclusively toward the redemption of the county indebtedness for which the bonds were issued.</p>
                  <p>(f) When the treasurer redeems any county indebtedness he shall endorse by writing or stamping in ink on the face of the paper evidencing the indebtedness redeemed, the time of redemption, the amount redeemed, whether by money or the exchange of bonds and the words "redeemed" and "cancelled". He shall keep a record of all bonds redeemed showing their number, rate of interest, date and amount of sale, when, where and to whom payable, and if exchanged, for what. The record shall be open for inspection by the public during usual office hours. He shall make detailed statements as often as required by the board of county commissioners of all bond redemption transactions and return to the board all redeemed and cancelled evidences of indebtedness.</p>

However, nothing in W.S. 18- 5-201 through 18-5-208 shall be construed to contravene any zoning authority of any incorporated city or town. No zoning resolution or plan shall prevent any use or occupancy reasonably necessary to the extraction or production of the mineral resources in or under any lands subject thereto. Nothing in W.S. 18-5-201 through 18-5-208 shall be construed to allow any board of county commissioners, through the establishment of minimum lot size requirements or otherwise, to prevent residential or agricultural uses authorized for land divisions that are exempt from subdivision requirements pursuant to W.S. 18-5-303(a)(i). No zoning resolution or plan shall regulate and restrict the location and use of buildings and structures and the use, condition of use or occupancy of lands for the use of a private school as defined in W.S. 21-4-101(a)(iii) in any manner different from a public school, provided that the private school:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is certified by the professional engineer or architect of record for the private school as being substantially similar to school facility commission guidelines for education buildings and siting and is designed to be constructed with appropriate materials, means and methods;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>18-5-316. Requirements for large acreage subdivision permits.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided, a county may, by resolution, elect to apply the provisions of this article on a uniform basis to the sale or disposition of any land where the subdivision creates parcels that are thirty-five (35) acres or larger and up to one hundred forty (140) acres. Except as provided in this subsection, each lawfully recorded parcel of land on July 1, 2008 shall be exempted from all provisions of this section other than compliance with paragraphs (i) through</p>
                  <p>(iii) of this subsection and W.S. 18-5-317 and shall be allowed to be divided into not more than ten (10) parcels of one hundred forty (140) acres or less in size, provided that each new or remaining parcel is no less than thirty-five (35) acres. Parcels created pursuant to this exemption may be created at any time and may be created over a period of years through separate transactions. In no case, however, shall this exemption be used to create more than ten (10) parcels of land from each original parcel and each parcel created after July 1, 2008 shall be subject to this section and W.S. 18-5-317 as otherwise provided in this section. Boundary adjustments between or among parcels shall not be considered as a division of property subject to the limitations in this section. If a county elects to apply this article to sales or dispositions where the subdivision creates parcels that are thirty-five (35) acres or larger and up to one hundred forty (140) acres, unless the property is exempted under this subsection, the subdivider shall obtain a subdivision permit pursuant to this section. The provisions of W.S. 18-5-306 and 18-5-315 shall not be applicable to a subdivision of land under this section but nothing in this sentence shall prohibit application of lawfully adopted zoning provisions.</p>
                  <p>Before granting the exemption provided in this subsection the board may require the person seeking the exemption to submit any or all of the following:</p>

The study shall include information relative to the potential availability and quality of groundwater proposed within the subdivision which may consist of new data, existing data on other working wells in the area, or other data, including drilling logs, from a test well drilled within the subdivision indicating soil types, depth, quantity and quality of water produced in the test well;</p>
                  <p>(B) Where individual on-lot wells are proposed:</p>
                  <p>(I) The study under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be required and the words "NO PROPOSED CENTRAL WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM," in bold capital letters shall appear on all offers, contracts, agreements and plats relating to the subdivision; and</p>
                  <p>(II) The board may require a study relative to the potential availability and quality of groundwater proposed within the subdivision which may consist of new data, existing data on other working wells in the area, or other data, including drilling logs from a test well drilled within the proposed subdivision indicating soil types, depth, quantity and quality of water produced in the test well.</p>

Where individual on-lot sewage systems are proposed, the words "NO PROPOSED CENTRALIZED SEWAGE SYSTEM," in bold capital letters shall appear on all offers, contracts, agreements and plats relating to the subdivision;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the subdivider proposes to utilize adjoining property for sewers, drainage, sewer lines, power lines or other utilities, the subdivider shall provide copies of binding easements of not less than twenty (20) feet in width for the proposed facilities from each property owner over whose land such services shall extend and shall provide a minimum access roadway right-of-way of sixty (60) feet to the subdivision for all public ways.

If, however, the subdivider proposes to make any streets, alleys or roadways private, then the subdivider shall submit to the board properly acknowledged written certification that certain streets, alleys or roadways within the subdivision shall remain private and the board shall be under no obligation to repair, maintain or accept any dedication of these roads to the public use. If no such public maintenance is contemplated on any of the roads, the subdivider shall put a legend on the plat of the subdivision and on all offers, contracts or agreements for the sale and purchase of lots within the subdivision showing the streets, alleys and roadways showing in capital letters "NO PUBLIC MAINTENANCE OF SPECIFIED STREETS OR ROADS";</p>
                  <p>(viii) Documentation that the subdivider has adequate financial resources to develop and complete any facility proposed or represented to be the responsibility of the subdivider, including but not limited to water supply systems, sewage systems, streets and roadways. The applicant shall provide a performance bond, acceptable letter of credit or other sufficient financial commitment to assure that any facilities proposed or represented to be part of the subdivision will in fact be completed as proposed, or escrow sufficient monies out of land sales to guarantee that the above facilities are installed. The amount of any bond or other financial commitment or escrow required under this paragraph shall reflect the estimated costs of providing the facilities;</p>

                  <p>(III) A plan, a copy of which was submitted to and approved by the state engineer prior to the final approval of the subdivision application, for the distribution of the water rights appurtenant to the land to be subdivided. The plan shall specify the distribution of the water to the lots within the subdivision and shall include all appropriate applications for change of use, change of place of use or change in point of diversion or means of conveyance in accordance with W.S. 41-3-103, 41-3-104 or 41-3-114.</p>

                  <p>(x) Evidence that all parcels of land created by the subdivision will be subject to written and recorded covenants or other instruments creating an entity, binding on subsequent owners of the land within the subdivision. The entities that may be used include, but are not limited to, special improvement districts, homeowners associations and mutual benefit corporations. The board shall not mandate the creation of an entity with the ability to interfere with any owner's ability to use his private property, except to collect any assessment. The entity shall have the ability to address the following topics:</p>
                  <p>(A) Maintenance and responsibility for common areas, roads and water supply systems and assessments against all parcels of land in the subdivision to defray the costs thereof;</p>
                  <p>(B) Continued management of the entity.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board shall require the applicant to obtain review and recommendations from the local conservation district regarding soil suitability, erosion control, sedimentation and flooding problems. The review and recommendations shall be completed within sixty (60) days.</p>

                  <p>(e) If the permit is approved the board shall require the applicant to put a legend on the plat and on all offers, contracts or agreements for the sale and purchase of lots within the subdivision showing in capital letters "THE SURFACE ESTATE OF THE LAND TO BE SUBDIVIDED IS SUBJECT TO FULL AND EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINERAL ESTATE".</p>
                  <p>(f) Nothing in this section shall require the acquisition of a permit for the sale or disposition of lands that on or before July 1, 2008 have been developed and promoted as part of a large acre subdivision as evidenced by dated plat maps, sales brochures or other evidence acceptable to the board.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the lots, units, tracts or parcels created pursuant to a permit issued under this section are used for agricultural purposes and otherwise qualify as agricultural land for purposes of W.S. 39-13-103(b)(x), the lots, units, tracts or parcels shall be deemed not to be part of a platted subdivision for purposes of W.S. 39-13-103(b)(x)(B)(II).</p>

                  <p>(i) "Conservation design process" means a planning process adopted by a county to offer a land use option for residential purposes that differs from traditional thirty-five (35) acre divisions of land described in W.S. 18-5-303(b) using cluster development and density bonuses to preserve open space through:</p>
                  <p>(A) Protection of wildlife habitat and critical areas; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Enhancement and maintenance of the rural character of lands with contiguity to agricultural lands suitable for long range farming and ranching operations.</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Cluster development" means any division of land that creates parcels containing less than thirty-five (35) acres each, for residential purposes, provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) One (1) or more parcels are being divided pursuant to a county conservation design process;</p>
                  <p>(B) An area within the county equal to not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the total area of the parcel, as defined in W.S 18-5-302(a)(x), being divided is reserved at the time of the development for the preservation of open space in furtherance of one (1) or more of the objectives described in paragraph (i) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(C) Unless otherwise provided through a density bonus, the gross overall density shall not exceed one (1) residential unit for each seventeen and one-half (17 1/2) acres; and</p>
                  <p>(D) Land set aside to preserve open space or to protect wildlife habitat or critical areas shall not be developed in any way that changes its open space designation for at least sixty-five (65) years from the date the cluster development is approved and shall be governed by the provisions of W.S. 18-5-403(b)(ii).</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Density bonus" means a land use design incentive that encourages optimized preservation of open space by allowing a gross overall density of two (2) or more residential units for each thirty-five (35) acres;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Open space" means an area of land or water that is substantially free of structures, impervious surfaces, roads and other land-altering activities and does not include lands used for private recreation such as golf courses and residential yards, areas devoted to parking, vehicular traffic, nonagricultural private use or any other use which does not significantly lend itself to the furtherance of one (1) or more of the objectives described in paragraph (i) of this subsection.

                  <p>(i) A plat of the cluster development has been prepared by or under the supervision of a Wyoming professional land surveyor, approved by the board and recorded with the county clerk in the county in which the land is located which includes a statement on the plat designating the open space area and clearly noting the duration of the open space reservation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A provision is approved by the board providing for the designation of the open space, which may be evidenced by conservation easements, restrictive covenants, dedication of open space to the public where the dedication will be accepted by the governing body or any other evidence approved by the board.

                  <p>(h) Each public library shall on or before October 1 of each year, submit a report to the state treasurer from its foundation on the endowment matching program under this section for the preceding fiscal year.

                  <p>(j) Notwithstanding subsection (e) of this section, matching funds may be distributed to or encumbered by a public library foundation in excess of the amount within the challenge fund account of that public library if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Endowment gifts for that public library exceed the amount within its challenge fund account;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The public library enters into a written agreement with another public library having unencumbered amounts remaining within its challenge fund account;</p>

Hospital generally under control of board of trustees; appointment, powers and duties of trustees; incorporation; use of funds for erection of hospital; term of lease; consolidation of hospitals; acquisition of land; removal of board member; filling of vacancies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The erection, management and control of the county memorial hospital, county memorial hospital fund and all property and funds received for the benefit of the hospital shall be by a board of trustees composed of at least five (5) but not more than eleven (11) competent and responsible citizens of the county appointed by the board of county commissioners. The number of members of any board of trustees shall be an odd number determined by the county commissioners. The first board of trustees, or additional members to a board of trustees, as soon as appointed shall draw lots for the purpose of determining the term of each member of the board. Up to two (2) members of the original board or additional members of the board shall serve for a term of one (1) year, up to two (2) for a term of two (2) years, up to two (2) for a term of three (3) years, up to two (2) for a term of four (4) years and up to two (2) for a term of five (5) years after their appointment. Terms thereafter shall be five (5) years, consecutively staggered. Each trustee shall serve until the first Monday of July following the expiration of their term and the board of county commissioners annually at their meeting in June shall appoint a successor to the trustee or trustees whose term expires. As soon as the original board has determined the terms of its members they shall organize by electing a president, secretary and treasurer of the board. As soon as they are organized they shall file with the county clerk and the secretary of state a certificate showing their organization, for which filing no fee or charge shall be paid. Upon filing the certificate the board of trustees is a body corporate with power to sue and be sued under the name of "Board of Trustees of the Memorial Hospital of .... County". No individual member of the board of trustees is personally liable for any action or procedure of the board. The corporation has perpetual existence and it is not necessary to file any other or further certificate than that filed upon the original organization of the board of trustees.</p>
                  <p>(b) Annually upon the appointment of a new member of the board, the trustees shall meet and organize by electing a president, secretary and treasurer. Each member of the board shall serve without compensation and the treasurer of the board shall give bond in such amount and with such sureties as approved by the board of county commissioners conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties and the full accounting for all monies received as treasurer. The board may allow and pay to the secretary such reasonable compensation as they deem proper for secretarial, accounting and other services required of him in addition to his general duties as a member of the board.</p>
                  <p>(c) The hospital shall be erected and maintained on lands whose title is in the county or upon which the county has a lease for the term of ninety-nine (99) years. If any county hospital is already owned and maintained by the county, the board of county commissioners may permit the erection of the county memorial hospital upon the grounds already owned and used as a county hospital with any additional grounds deemed necessary and may transfer the management and control of the old hospital to the board of trustees of the memorial county hospital so that the old and the new may be consolidated and operated, controlled and maintained as a single hospital. If any county is without title to sufficient land for the county hospital it may acquire necessary lands by gift, purchase or condemnation under the procedure authorized in exercising the right to eminent domain.</p>
                  <p>(d) Subject to constitutional limitations, in addition to any other securities the legislature authorizes or has authorized by law for investment, any funds of the hospital may be invested by the hospital board in any security which has been recommended by an investment advisor registered under the Uniform Investment Advisor's Act of 1940 as amended, or any bank exercising its trust powers, and approved by the board. In approving securities for the investment under this subsection, the board shall be subject to and act in accordance with the provisions of the Wyoming Uniform Prudent Investor Act. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to authorize the use of any revenues generated from taxes to engage in any activity authorized under W.S. 18-8-301(a).</p>
                  <p>(e) The county commissioners may remove any member of the board of trustees for just cause without a public hearing unless the trustee requests a public hearing. Vacancies on the board of trustees shall be filled by the county commissioners for the balance of the unexpired term created by the vacancy.</p>

                  <p>(a) When a county memorial hospital as defined in W.S. 18-8-101 has been established as provided in W.S. 18-8-102 the board of county commissioners when requested by the board of trustees of a county memorial hospital may issue revenue bonds, notes and warrants or other revenue securities for the purpose of acquiring, erecting, constructing, reconstructing, improving, remodeling, furnishing or equipping hospitals or related facilities, or acquiring a site or sites therefor. The procedure for issuing or refunding revenue bonds is the same as prescribed by W.S. 35-2-424 through 35-2-436 as from time to time amended.</p>
                  <p>(b) The trustees of a county memorial hospital may obtain financing for its operations by entering into agreements for lines of credit with any financial institution as defined in W.S. 13-1-101(a)(ix). The line of credit may either be unsecured, or secured by a pledge of revenues anticipated to be received during the current fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>(c) In addition to the authority of the county commissioners to issue certificates of indebtedness to meet the obligations of county memorial hospitals under W.S. 18-4-104, with the permission of the board of county commissioners, the trustees of a county memorial hospital may issue tax and revenue anticipation notes in amounts not to exceed eighty percent (80%) of the total amount of taxes levied for operation of the hospital for the fiscal year during which the notes are issued when the board determines that insufficient funds are available to meet the obligations of the hospital during any fiscal year. A county memorial hospital shall not enter into agreements or issue instruments of the type allowed by this section for any fiscal year until all debts financed by such agreements or instruments for any prior fiscal year have been paid in full. Tax and revenue anticipation notes issued under this subsection are subject to the procedural requirements of W.S. 9-4-1103 through 9-4-1105 for state tax and revenue anticipation notes, except:</p>
                  <p>(i) The authority of the state treasurer referenced in W.S. 9-4-1103 through 9-4-1105 shall be exercised by the board issuing the notes; and</p>

                <p>(a) The body having authority to levy taxes or make assessments within each county shall levy the taxes or assessments authorized herein and all officials charged with the duty of assessing property and collecting taxes shall assess property and collect proceeds at the time and in the form and manner with like interest and penalties as property is assessed and other taxes are collected, and when collected they shall pay the same to the district ordering the assessment or levy and collection. The payment of the collections shall be made monthly to the treasurer of the district and paid into its depository to the credit of the district. All taxes levied under this act, together with interest thereon and penalties for default in payment thereof, and all costs of collecting the same, constitute, until paid, a perpetual lien on and against the property taxed, and such lien shall be administered as and on a parity with the tax lien of other general taxes.</p>
                <p>(b) For any district established to provide emergency medical services under W.S. 18-12-112(a)(xxii) at the time of making the levy for county purposes, the county shall levy a tax for that year upon the taxable property in the district in its county for its proportionate share based on assessed valuation of the estimated amount of funds needed by each district providing emergency medical services, but, except as provided in this subsection, in no case shall the tax for the district exceed in any one (1) year the amount of two (2) mills on each dollar of assessed valuation of the property. Up to an additional two (2) mills may be imposed on each dollar of assessed valuation of the property if approved by the board of directors and if approved by the electors as provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                <p>(c) If the board of directors votes to increase the mill levy beyond two (2) mills as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, the board of county commissioners shall call an election within the district upon the question of whether the mill levy should be increased beyond two (2) mills. The election shall be called, conducted and canvassed as provided for bond elections by the Political Subdivision Bond Election Law, W.S. 22-21-101 through 22-21-112, on the first date authorized under W.S. 22-21-103 which is not less than sixty (60) days after the board of directors votes to increase the mill levy beyond two (2) mills. In no event shall the tax in a district providing emergency medical services exceed in any one (1) year the amount of four (4) mills on each dollar of assessed valuation of property. The increase in mill levy is effective only if the question is approved by a majority of those voting thereon within the district providing emergency medical services. The cost of any special election under this subsection shall be borne by the board of directors.</p>
                <p>(d) If the proposition to authorize an additional mill levy is approved, the tax shall remain in effect until a petition to discontinue the tax, signed by not less than ten percent (10%) of the voters of the district, is received by the board of county commissioners, at which time the proposal to discontinue the tax shall be submitted to the voters of the district at the expense of the county at the next general election. If the proposition to impose or discontinue the tax is defeated, the proposition shall not again be submitted to the electors for at least twenty-three (23) months.</p>
                <p>(e) The board of directors shall administer the finances of the district providing emergency medical services in accordance with W.S. 16-4-101 through 16-4-124.</p>
