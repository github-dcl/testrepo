                <p>(a) The term "trademark" as used in this act means any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a person to identify and distinguish the goods of such person, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown.</p>
                <p>(b) The term "service mark" as used in this act means any word, name, symbol or device or any combination thereof used by a person, to identify and distinguish the services of one (1) person, including a unique service, from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services, even if that source is unknown. Titles, character names used by a person and other distinctive features of radio or television programs may be registered as service marks notwithstanding that they, or the programs, may advertise the goods of the sponsor.</p>
                <p>(c) The term "mark" as used in this act includes any trademark or service mark entitled to registration under this act whether registered or not.</p>
                <p>(d) The term "person" and any other word or term used to designate the applicant or other party entitled to a benefit or privilege or rendered liable under the provisions of this act includes a juristic person as well as a natural person. The term "juristic person" includes a firm, partnership, corporation, association, union or other organization or business entity capable of suing and being sued in a court of law.</p>

                <p>(f) The term "registrant" as used in this act embraces the person to whom the registration of a mark under this act is issued and the legal representatives, successors or assigns of such person.</p>
                <p>(g) The term "use" in this act means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. For the purposes of this act, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in this state:</p>
                <p>(i) On goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or other containers on the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale, and the goods are sold or transported in commerce in this state; and</p>
                <p>(ii) On services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in this state.</p>
                <p>(h) A mark shall be deemed to be "abandoned" under this act when either of the following occurs:</p>
                <p>(i) When its use has been discontinued with the intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for two (2) consecutive years shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment;</p>
                <p>(ii) When any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to lose its significance as a mark.</p>
                <p>(j) The term "dilution" as used in this act means the lessening of the capacity of a registrant's mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or absence of:</p>
                <p>(i) Competition between the parties; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception.</p>
                <p>(k) The term "secretary" as used in this act means the secretary of state or the designee of the secretary charged with the administration of this act.</p>
                <p>(m) "This act" means W.S. 40-1-101 through 40-1-116.</p>

                <p>(a) A mark by which the goods or services of any applicant for registration may be distinguished from the goods or services of others shall not be registered if it:</p>
                <p>(i) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive or scandalous matter; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Consists of or comprises matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or of any state or municipality, or of any foreign nation, or any simulation thereof; or</p>
                <p>(iv) Consists of or comprises the name, signature or portrait identifying a particular living individual, except by the individual's written consent; or</p>
                <p>(v) Consists of a mark which, (A) when used on or in connection with the goods or services of the applicant, is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, or (B) when used on or in connection with the goods or services of the applicant is primarily geographically descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, or (C) is primarily merely a surname; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the registration of a mark used in this state by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods or services. The secretary may accept as evidence that the mark has become distinctive, as used on or in connection with the applicant's goods or services, proof of continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant in this state or elsewhere for the five (5) years before the date on which the claim of distinctiveness is made; or</p>
                <p>(vi) Consists of or comprises a mark which is the same as, or deceptively similar to, a mark registered in this state, a trade name or the name of a juristic person, or a mark or trade name previously used in this state by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods or services of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this act, any person who uses a mark in this state may file in the office of the secretary, in a manner complying with the requirements of the secretary, an application for registration of that mark setting forth, but not limited to, the following information:</p>
                <p>(i) The name and business address of the person applying for such registration; and, if a corporation, the state of incorporation, or if a partnership, the state in which the partnership is organized and the names of the general partners, as specified by the secretary, or similar information for other juristic persons, as specified by the secretary;</p>
                <p>(ii) The goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is used and the mode or manner in which the mark is used on or in connection with such goods or services and the class in which such goods or services fall;</p>
                <p>(iii) The date when the mark was first used anywhere and the date when it was first used in this state by the applicant or a predecessor in interest;</p>
                <p>(iv) A statement that the applicant is the owner of the mark, that the mark is in use and that to the knowledge of the person verifying the application, no other person has registered, either federally or in this state, or has the right to use such mark either in the identical form thereof or in such near resemblance as to be likely, when applied to the goods or services of such other person, to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive; and</p>
                <p>(v) If required by the secretary, a statement as to whether an application to register the mark, or portions or a composite, has been filed by the applicant or a predecessor in interest in the United States patent and trademark office; and, if so, the applicant shall provide full particulars including the filing date and serial number of each application, the status and, if any application was finally refused registration or has otherwise not resulted in a registration, the reasons therefor.</p>
                <p>(b) The application shall be signed and verified by oath, affirmation or declaration subject to perjury laws by the applicant or by a member of the firm or an officer of the corporation or association applying.</p>
                <p>(c) The application shall be accompanied by a specimen or facsimile of such mark in triplicate. The secretary may also require that a drawing of the mark, complying with requirements as the secretary may specify, accompany the application.</p>
                <p>(d) The application for registration shall be accompanied by a filing fee, set in accordance with W.S. 40-1-116, but not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) and payable to the secretary.</p>

                <p>(a) Upon the filing of an application for registration and payment of the application fee, the secretary may cause the application to be examined for conformity with this act.</p>
                <p>(b) The applicant shall provide any additional pertinent information requested by the secretary, including a description of a design mark and may make or authorize the secretary to make such amendments to the application as may be reasonably requested by the secretary or deemed by the applicant to be advisable to respond to any rejection or objection.</p>
                <p>(c) The secretary may require the applicant to disclaim an unregisterable component of a mark otherwise registerable and an applicant may voluntarily disclaim a component of a mark sought to be registered. No disclaimer shall prejudice or affect the applicant's or registrant's rights then existing or thereafter arising in the disclaimed matter, or the applicant's or registrant's rights of registration on another application if the disclaimed matter be or shall have become distinctive of the applicant's or registrant's goods or services.</p>
                <p>(d) Amendments may be made by the secretary upon the application submitted by the applicant upon the applicant's agreement or a fresh application may be required to be submitted.</p>
                <p>(e) If the applicant is found not to be entitled to registration, the secretary shall advise the applicant of the reasons. The applicant shall have a reasonable period of time specified by the secretary in which to reply or to amend the application, in which event the application shall then be reexamined. This procedure may be repeated until (A) the secretary finally refuses registration of the mark or (B) the applicant fails to reply or amend within the specified period, whereupon the application shall be deemed to have been abandoned.</p>

If such willful intent is proven, the owner shall also be entitled to the remedies set forth in this act, subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity.</p>

                <p>(a) The provisions of W.S. 40-4-107 and 40-4-109 shall not apply to any sale made:</p>
                <p>(i) In closing out in good faith the owner's stock or any part thereof for the purpose of discontinuing his trade in any such stock or commodity, and in the case of the sale of seasonal goods or to the bona fide sale of perishable goods to prevent loss to the vendor by spoilage or depreciation, provided notice is given to the public thereof;</p>
                <p>(ii) When the goods are damaged or deteriorated in quality, and notice is given to the public thereof;</p>
                <p>(iii) By an officer acting under the orders of any court;</p>
                <p>(iv) In an endeavor made in good faith to meet the prices of a competitor selling the same or similar article or product in the same locality or trade area;</p>
                <p>(v) When the goods are sold for promotional purposes at a special sale of limited duration including but not limited to a grand opening sale, an annual anniversary sale, an annual customer appreciation sale or a community, neighborhood or mall wide sale;</p>

For pharmaceuticals, for the purposes of this subsection, prices are identical if they are identical for a supply for a defined period of time even though the physical quantities of pharmaceuticals may be different.</p>

                  <p>(a) For purposes of this section, "home solicitation sale" means the sale or lease of merchandise, other than farm equipment, for cash when the cash sales price, whether under a single sale or multiple sales, exceeds twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and in which the seller or a person acting for him engages in a personal solicitation of the sale at the residence of the buyer and the buyer's agreement or offer to purchase is there given to the seller or a person acting for him. A personal solicitation of a sale at the residence of the buyer includes contact with the buyer in person or by telephone. "Home solicitation sale" does not include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A sale made pursuant to a preexisting revolving charge account;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A sale made subsequent to a personal contact or a telephone contact at the residence of the buyer but pursuant to negotiations between the parties at a business establishment at a fixed location where goods or services are offered or exhibited for sale;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A sale made pursuant to a telephone solicitation when the seller offers a full refund and right of cancellation for at least ten (10) days after receipt of the merchandise and the right of refund and cancellation is communicated during the initial telephone solicitation and is conspicuously displayed with the merchandise; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) A sale in which a consumer acquires use of property under a rental-purchase agreement as defined in W.S. 40-19-102(a)(xi), with an initial period of one (1) week or less, by placing a telephone call to a merchant and by requesting that specific property be delivered to the consumer's residence or such other place as the consumer directs and such rental-purchase agreement is consummated at the consumer's residence.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as hereinafter provided, in addition to any right otherwise to revoke an offer, the buyer has the right to cancel a home solicitation sale until midnight of the third business day after the day on which the buyer signs an agreement or offer to purchase which complies with this part. Cancellation occurs when the buyer gives written notice of cancellation to the seller at the address stated in the agreement or offer to purchase. Notice of cancellation, if given by mail, is given when it is deposited in a mailbox properly addressed and postage prepaid. Notice of cancellation given by the buyer need not take a particular form and is sufficient if it indicates by any form of written expression the intention of the buyer not to be bound by the home solicitation sale.</p>
                  <p>(c) The buyer may not cancel a home solicitation sale if the buyer requests the seller to provide goods or services without delay because of an emergency and:</p>
                  <p>(i) The seller in good faith makes a substantial beginning of performance of the contract before the buyer gives notice of cancellation; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of goods, the goods cannot be returned to the seller in substantially as good condition as when received by the buyer.</p>
                  <p>(d) The period within which cancellation may occur pursuant to this section shall not commence until the buyer is furnished a copy of the completed, approved and accepted contract, is given the name and address to which the notice of cancellation should be sent and is provided with a written statement of his right of cancellation. The statement of the buyer's right of cancellation shall comply with W.S. 40-14-253(b).</p>

The action may be brought in the district court of the county in which the person resides or has his principal place of business or in the district court of Laramie county, Wyoming. The district court may issue temporary restraining orders, including ex parte temporary restraining orders, or preliminary or permanent injunctions, in accordance with the principles of equity, to restrain and prevent violations of this act.

Such assurance is not considered an admission of violation for any purpose. Proof of failure to comply with the assurance of voluntary compliance is prima facie evidence of a violation of this act. Matters closed by virtue of the acceptance of an assurance of voluntary compliance may at any time be reopened by the enforcing authority for further proceedings in the public interest, pursuant to W.S. 40-12-106.</p>

                  <p>(a) If, by inquiry by the enforcing authority or as a result of complaints, the enforcing authority has probable cause to believe that a person has engaged in, or is engaging in, an act or practice that violates this act, investigators designated by the Wyoming attorney general may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses or matter, and collect evidence. Within five (5) days, excluding weekends and legal holidays, after the service of a subpoena or at any time before the return date specified therein, whichever is longer, the party served may file in the district court in the county in which the party resides or in which the party transacts business, or in the district court for the first judicial district of Wyoming, and serve upon the enforcing authority a petition for an order modifying or setting aside the subpoena. The petitioner may raise any objection or privilege which would be available under this act or upon service of a subpoena in a civil action. The subpoena shall inform the party served of the party's rights under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) If matter that the enforcing authority seeks to obtain by subpoena is located outside the state, the person subpoenaed may make it available to the enforcing authority to examine the matter at the place where it is located.

                  <p>(c) Upon failure of a person without lawful excuse to obey a subpoena and upon reasonable notice to all persons affected, the enforcing authority may apply to the district court for an order compelling compliance.</p>
                  <p>(d) The enforcing authority may request that an individual who refuses to comply with a subpoena on the ground that testimony or matter may incriminate the individual, be ordered by the court to provide the testimony or matter. Except in a prosecution for perjury, an individual who complies with a court order to provide testimony or matter after asserting a privilege against self-incrimination to which the individual is entitled by law shall not have the testimony or matter so provided, or evidence derived therefrom, received against the individual in any criminal investigation or proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any person upon whom a subpoena is served pursuant to this section shall comply with the terms thereof unless otherwise provided by order of the court. Any person who fails to appear with the intent to avoid, evade or prevent compliance in whole or in part with any investigation under this act or who removes from any place, conceals, withholds, mutilates, alters or destroys, or by any other means falsifies any documentary material in the possession, custody or control of any person subject to the subpoena, or knowingly conceals any relevant information with the intent to avoid, evade or prevent compliance is liable for a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), reasonable attorney's fees and costs.</p>
                  <p>(f) Whenever criminal or civil intelligence, investigative information or any other information held by any state or federal agency is available to the enforcing authority on a confidential or a similarly restricted basis, the enforcing authority, in the course of the investigation of any violation of this act, may obtain and use the information.

                  <p>(b) For purposes of this section, the court issuing an injunction shall retain jurisdiction, and the cause shall be continued.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided in W.S. 40-12-111, any person or agent or employee of the person, who willfully uses, or has willfully used, a method or act, in violation of this act, is liable for a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each violation. Willful violations occur when the person knew or should have known that the person's conduct was unfair or deceptive. This civil penalty may be recovered in any action brought under this act by the enforcing authority or the enforcing authority may terminate any investigation or action upon agreement by the person to pay a stipulated civil penalty. The enforcing authority or the court may waive any civil penalty if the person has previously made full restitution or reimbursement or has paid actual damages to the consumers who have been injured by the unlawful act or practice. If civil penalties are assessed in any litigation, the enforcing authority is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs.</p>

Any judicial determination of factual innocence made pursuant to this section may be heard and determined upon declarations, affidavits, police reports or other material, relevant and reliable information submitted by the parties or ordered to be part of the record by the court. Where the court determines that the petition or motion is meritorious and that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the victim committed the offense for which the perpetrator of the identity theft was arrested, cited, convicted or subject to a criminal complaint in the victim's name, or that the victim's identity has been mistakenly associated with a record of criminal conviction, the court shall find the victim factually innocent of that offense.

Access to the database shall be limited to criminal justice agencies, victims of identity theft and individuals and agencies authorized by the victims.</p>

                  <p>(a) With respect to a consumer credit sale, other than a sale pursuant to a revolving charge account, a seller may contract for and receive a credit service charge not exceeding that permitted by this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The credit service charge, calculated according to the actuarial method, may not exceed:</p>
                  <p>(i) Where the amount financed does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), the equivalent of the greater of either of the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The total of: Thirty-six percent (36%) per year on that part of the unpaid balances of the amount financed which is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less and twenty-one percent (21%) per year on that part of the unpaid balances of the amount financed which is more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); or</p>
                  <p>(B) Twenty-one percent (21%) per year on that part of the unpaid balances of the amount financed.</p>
                  <p>(C) Repealed by Laws 1981, ch. 147, § 1.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Where the amount financed exceeds seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), any credit service charge specified in the buyer's sale agreement.</p>
                  <p>(c) This section does not limit or restrict the manner of contracting for the credit service charge, whether by way of add-on, discount, or otherwise, so long as the rate of the credit service charge does not exceed that permitted by this section. If the sale is precomputed:</p>
                  <p>(i) The credit service charge may be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled payments will be made when due; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The effect of prepayment is governed by the provisions on rebate upon prepayment (W.S. 40-14-221).</p>
                  <p>(d) For the purposes of this section, the term of a sale agreement commences with the date the credit is granted or, if goods are delivered or services performed ten (10) days or more after that date, with the date of commencement of delivery or performance. Differences in the lengths of months are disregarded and a day may be counted as one-thirtieth of a month. Subject to classifications and differentiations the seller may reasonably establish, a part of a month in excess of fifteen (15) days may be treated as a full month if periods of fifteen (15) days or less are disregarded and that procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted.</p>
                  <p>(e) Subject to classifications and differentiations the seller may reasonably establish, he may make the same credit service charge on all amounts financed within a specified range. A credit service charge so made does not violate subsection (b) of this section if:</p>
                  <p>(i) When applied to the median amount within each range, it does not exceed the maximum permitted by subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) When applied to the lowest amount within each range, it does not produce a rate of credit service charge exceeding the rate calculated according to paragraph (a)(i) of this section by more than eight percent (8%) of the rate calculated according to paragraph (a)(i) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the seller may contract for and receive a minimum credit service charge of not more than thirty dollars ($30.00).</p>

                  <p>(i) Official fees and taxes;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Charges for insurance as described in subsection</p>

                  <p>(b) An additional charge may be made for insurance written in connection with the sale, other than insurance protecting the seller against the buyer's default or other credit loss:</p>
                  <p>(i) With respect to insurance against loss of or damage to property, or against liability, if the seller furnishes a clear and specific statement in writing to the buyer, setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the seller, and stating that the buyer may choose the person through whom the insurance is to be obtained;</p>
                  <p>(ii) With respect to consumer credit insurance providing life, accident, or health coverage, if the insurance coverage is not a factor in the approval by the seller of the extension of credit and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the buyer, and if, in order to obtain the insurance in connection with the extension of credit, the buyer gives specific affirmative written indication of his desire to do so after written disclosure to him of the cost thereof;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 124, § 3.</p>

                  <p>(b) A charge may be made in each billing cycle which is a percentage of an amount no greater than:</p>
                  <p>(i) The average daily balance of the account;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The unpaid balance of the account on the same day of the billing cycle; or</p>

A charge may be made pursuant to this paragraph only if the seller, subject to classifications and differentiations he may reasonably establish, makes the same charge on all balances within the specified range and if the percentage when applied to the median amount within the range does not produce a charge exceeding the charge resulting from applying that percentage to the lowest amount within the range by more than eight percent (8%) of the charge on the median amount.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, upon prepayment in full of the unpaid balance of a precomputed consumer credit sale, refinancing or consolidation, the unearned credit service charge shall be refunded based upon the Rule of 78's if the transaction under its original terms did not exceed sixty-one (61) monthly installments and upon the actuarial method, if the transaction by its original terms exceeded sixty-one (61) monthly installments. An amount not less than the unearned portion of the credit service charge calculated according to this section shall be rebated to the debtor. With respect to irregular payment transactions, the administrator may prescribe by rule the refund formula. If the rebate otherwise required is less than one dollar ($1.00), no rebate need be made.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon prepayment in full of a consumer credit sale, refinancing, or consolidation, other than one (1) pursuant to a revolving charge account, if the credit service charge then earned is less than any permitted minimum credit service charge (W.S. 40-14-212(f)) contracted for, whether or not the sale, refinancing, or consolidation is precomputed, the seller may collect or retain the minimum charge, as if earned, not exceeding the credit service charge contracted for.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a deferral (W.S. 40-14-215) has been agreed to, the unearned portion of the credit service charge shall be computed without regard to the deferral. The amount of deferral charge earned at the date of prepayment shall also be calculated. If the deferral charge earned is less than the deferral charge paid, the difference shall be added to the unearned portion of the credit service charge. If any part of a deferral charge has been earned but has not been paid, that part shall be subtracted from the unearned portion of the credit service charge or shall be added to the unpaid balance.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section does not preclude the collection or retention by the seller of delinquency charges (W.S. 40-14-214).</p>
                  <p>(e) If the maturity is accelerated for any reason and judgment is obtained, the buyer is entitled to the same rebate as if payment had been made on the date judgment is entered.</p>
                  <p>(f) Upon prepayment in full of a consumer credit sale by the proceeds of consumer credit insurance (W.S. 40-14-403), the buyer or his estate is entitled to the same rebate as though the buyer had prepaid the agreement on the date the proceeds of the insurance are paid to the seller, but no later than ten (10) business days after satisfactory proof of loss is furnished to the seller.</p>

                  <p>(a) With respect to a consumer credit sale or consumer lease an agreement by the buyer or lessee not to assert against an assignee a claim or defense arising out of the sale or lease is enforceable only by an assignee not related to the seller or lessor who acquires the buyer's or lessee's contract in good faith and for value, who gives the buyer or lessee notice of the assignment as provided in this section and who, within forty-five (45) days after the mailing of the notice of assignment, receives no written notice of the facts giving rise to the buyer's or lessee's claim or defense. This agreement is enforceable only with respect to claims or defenses which have arisen before the end of the forty-five (45) day period after notice was mailed. The notice of assignment shall be in writing and addressed to the buyer or lessee at his address as stated in the contract, identify the contract, describe the goods or services, state the names of the seller or lessor and buyer or lessee, the name and address of the assignee, the amount payable by the buyer or lessee and the number, amounts and due dates of the installments, and contain a conspicuous notice to the buyer or lessee that he has forty-five (45) days within which to notify the assignee in writing of any complaints, claims or defenses he may have against the seller or lessor and that if written notification of the complaints, claims or defenses is not received by the assignee within the forty-five (45) day period, the assignee will have the right to enforce the contract free of any claims or defenses the buyer or lessee may have against the seller or lessor which have arisen before the end of the forty-five (45) day period after notice was mailed.</p>
                  <p>(b) An assignee does not acquire a buyer's or lessee's contract in good faith within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section if the assignee has knowledge or, from his course of dealing with the seller or lessor or his records, notice of substantial complaints by other buyers or lessees of the seller's or lessor's failure or refusal to perform his contracts with them and of the seller's or lessor's failure to remedy his defaults within a reasonable time after the assignee notifies him of the complaints.</p>
                  <p>(c) To the extent that under this section an assignee is subject to claims or defenses of the buyer or lessee against the seller or lessor, the assignee's liability under this section may not exceed the amount owing to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against the assignee and rights of the buyer or lessee under this section can only be asserted as a matter of defense to or setoff against a claim by the assignee.</p>

                  <p>(a) With respect to a consumer credit sale, a seller may take a security interest in the property sold. In addition, a seller may take a security interest in goods upon which services are performed or in which goods sold are installed or to which they are annexed, or in land to which the goods are affixed or which is maintained, repaired or improved as a result of the sale of the goods or services, if in the case of a security interest in land the debt secured is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, or, in the case of a security interest in goods the debt secured is three hundred dollars ($300.00) or more. Except as provided with respect to cross-collateral (W.S. 40-14-242), a seller may not otherwise take a security interest in property of the buyer to secure the debt arising from a consumer credit sale.</p>
                  <p>(b) With respect to a consumer lease a lessor shall not take a security interest in property of the lessee to secure the debt arising from the lease. This subsection does not apply to a security deposit for a consumer lease.</p>
                  <p>(c) A security interest taken in violation of this section is void.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to contracting for a security interest pursuant to the provisions on security in sales or leases (W.S. 40-14-241), a seller in a consumer credit sale may secure the debt arising from the sale by contracting for a security interest in other property if as a result of a prior sale the seller has an existing security interest in the other property. The seller may also contract for a security interest in the property sold in the subsequent sale as security for the previous debt.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the seller contracts for a security interest in other property pursuant to this section, the rate of credit service charge thereafter on the aggregate unpaid balances so secured may not exceed that permitted if the balances so secured were consolidated pursuant to the provisions on consolidation involving a refinancing (W.S. 40-14-217(a)(i)). The seller has a reasonable time after so contracting to make any adjustments required by this section. "Seller" in this section does not include an assignee not related to the original seller.</p>

                  <p>(a) If debts arising from two (2) or more consumer credit sales, other than sales pursuant to a revolving charge account, are secured by cross-collateral (W.S. 40-14-242) or consolidated into one (1) debt payable on a single schedule of payments, and the debt is secured by security interests taken with respect to one (1) or more of the sales, payments received by the seller after the taking of the cross-collateral or the consolidation are deemed, for the purpose of determining the amount of the debt secured by the various security interests, to have been first applied to the payment of the debts arising from the sales first made. To the extent debts are paid according to this section, security interests in items of property terminate as the debts originally incurred with respect to each item are paid.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payments received by the seller upon a revolving charge account are deemed, for the purpose of determining the amount of the debt secured by the various security interests, to have been applied first to the payment of credit service charges in the order of their entry to the account and then to the payment of debts in the order in which the entries to the account showing the debts were made.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the debts consolidated arose from two (2) or more sales made on the same day, payments received by the seller are deemed, for the purpose of determining the amount of the debt secured by the various security interests, to have been applied first to the payment of the smallest debt.</p>

An assignment of earnings in violation of this section is unenforceable by the assignee of the earnings and revocable by the buyer or lessee.

If a buyer or lessee is induced by a violation of this section to enter into a consumer credit sale or consumer lease, the agreement is unenforceable by the seller or lessor and the buyer or lessee, at his option, may rescind the agreement or retain the goods delivered and the benefit of any services performed, without any obligation to pay for them.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a seller makes a change in the terms of a revolving charge account without complying with this section any additional cost or charge to the buyer resulting from the change is an excess charge and subject to the remedies available to debtors (W.S. 40-14-521) and to the administrator (W.S. 40-14-613).</p>
                  <p>(b) A seller may change the terms of the revolving charge account whether or not the change is authorized by prior agreement. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the seller shall give to the buyer written notice of any change at least three (3) times, with the first notice at least six (6) months before the effective date of the change.</p>
                  <p>(c) The notice specified in subsection (b) of this section is not required if notice of any proposed change in the terms of a revolving charge account is given to the customer at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such change or thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the billing cycle within which such change will become effective, whichever is the earlier date, and if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The buyer after receiving notice of the change agrees in writing to the change;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The buyer elects to pay an amount designated on a billing statement as including a new charge for a benefit offered to the buyer when the benefit and charge constitute the change in terms and when the billing statement also states the amount payable if the new charge is excluded;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The change involves no significant cost to the buyer;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The buyer has previously consented in writing to the kind of change made and notice of the change is given to the buyer in two (2) billing cycles prior to the effective date of the change; or</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>40-14-310. Loan finance charge for consumer loans other than supervised loans.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) With respect to a consumer loan other than a supervised loan (W.S. 40-14-341), a lender may contract for and receive a loan finance charge, calculated according to the actuarial method, not exceeding ten percent (10%) per year on the unpaid balances of the principal.</p>
                  <p>(b) This section does not limit or restrict the manner of contracting for the loan finance charge, whether by way of add-on, discount, or otherwise, so long as the rate of the loan finance charge does not exceed that permitted by this section. If the loan is precomputed:</p>
                  <p>(i) The loan finance charge may be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled payments will be made when due; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The effect of prepayment is governed by the provisions on rebate upon prepayment (W.S. 40-14-319).</p>
                  <p>(c) For the purposes of this section, the term of a loan commences with the date the loan is made. Differences in the lengths of months are disregarded and a day may be counted as one-thirtieth of a month. Subject to classifications and differentiations the lender may reasonably establish, a part of a month in excess of fifteen (15) days may be treated as a full month if periods of fifteen (15) days or less are disregarded and if that procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted.</p>
                  <p>(d) With respect to a consumer loan made pursuant to a revolving loan account:</p>
                  <p>(i) The loan finance charge shall be deemed not to exceed ten percent (10%) per year if the loan finance charge contracted for and received does not exceed a charge in each monthly billing cycle which is five-sixths of one percent of an amount no greater than:</p>
                  <p>(A) The average daily balance of the debt;</p>
                  <p>(B) The unpaid balance of the debt on the same day of the billing cycle; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Subject to subsection (e) of this section, the median amount within a specified range within which the average daily balance or the unpaid balance of the debt, on the same day of the billing cycle, is included; for the purposes of this paragraph and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a variation of not more than four (4) days from month to month is "the same day of the billing cycle".</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the billing cycle is not monthly, the loan finance charge shall be deemed not to exceed ten percent (10%) per year if the loan finance charge contracted for and received does not exceed a percentage which bears the same relation to five-sixths of one percent as the number of days in the billing cycle bears to thirty (30); and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if there is an unpaid balance on the date as of which the loan finance charge is applied, the lender may contract for and receive a charge not exceeding fifty cents ($.50) if the billing cycle is monthly or longer, or the pro rata part of fifty cents ($.50) which bears the same relation to fifty cents ($.50) as the number of days in the billing cycle bears to thirty (30) if the billing cycle is shorter than monthly, but no charge may be made pursuant to this paragraph if the lender has made an annual charge for the same period as permitted by the provisions on additional charges (W.S. 40-14-311(a)(iii)).</p>
                  <p>(e) Subject to classifications and differentiations the lender may reasonably establish, he may make the same loan finance charge on all amounts financed within a specified range. A loan finance charge so made does not violate subsection (a) of this section if:</p>
                  <p>(i) When applied to the median amount within each range, it does not exceed the maximum permitted by subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) When applied to the lowest amount within each range, it does not produce a rate of loan finance charge exceeding the rate calculated according to paragraph (i) of this subsection by more than eight percent (8%) of the rate calculated according to paragraph (i) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, and except as provided for pawnbrokers in W.S. 40-14-360(f) and post-dated check cashers in W.S. 40-14-363, the lender may contract for and receive a minimum loan finance charge of not more than thirty dollars ($30.00).</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to the loan finance charge permitted by this article, a lender may contract for and receive the following additional charges in connection with a consumer loan:</p>

                  <p>(ii) Charges for insurance as described in subsection</p>

                  <p>(iii) Annual charges, payable in advance, for the privilege of using a lender credit card or similar arrangement which entitles the user to purchase goods or services from at least one hundred (100) persons not related to the issuer of the lender credit card or similar arrangement, under an arrangement pursuant to which the debts resulting from the purchases are payable to the issuer;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Charges excluded from the loan finance charge by the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or by rule adopted by the administrator.</p>
                  <p>(b) An additional charge may be made for insurance written in connection with the loan, other than insurance protecting the lender against the debtor's default or other credit loss:</p>
                  <p>(i) With respect to insurance against loss of or damage to property, or against liability, if the lender furnishes a clear and specific statement in writing to the debtor, setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the lender, and stating that the debtor may choose the person through whom the insurance is to be obtained;</p>
                  <p>(ii) With respect to consumer credit insurance providing life, accident, or health coverage, if the insurance coverage is not a factor in the approval by the lender of the extension of credit, and this fact is clearly disclosed in writing to the debtor, and if, in order to obtain the insurance in connection with the extension of credit, the debtor gives specific affirmative written indication of his desire to do so after written disclosure to him of the cost thereof.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 124, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(c) Reasonable closing costs (W.S. 40-14-140(a)(v)) are additional charges.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>40-14-312. Delinquency charges.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) With respect to a consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation, the parties may contract for a delinquency charge on any installment not paid in full within ten (10) days after its scheduled due date in an amount not exceeding the greater of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Five percent (5%) of the unpaid amount of the installment; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ten dollars ($10.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) A delinquency charge under paragraph (a)(i) of this section may be collected only once on an installment however long it remains in default. No delinquency charge may be collected if the installment has been deferred and a deferral charge (W.S. 40-14-313) has been paid or incurred until ten (10) days after the deferred due date. A delinquency charge may be collected at the time it accrues or at any time thereafter.</p>
                  <p>(c) No delinquency charge may be collected on an installment which is paid in full within ten (10) days after its scheduled installment due date even though an earlier maturing installment or a delinquency charge on an earlier installment may not have been paid in full. For purposes of this subsection payments are applied first to current installments and then to delinquent installments.</p>
                  <p>(d) If two (2) installments or parts thereof of a precomputed loan are in default for ten (10) days or more, the lender may elect to convert the loan from a precomputed loan to one in which the loan finance charge is based on unpaid balances. In this event he shall make a rebate pursuant to the provisions on rebate upon prepayment (W.S. 40-14-319) as of the maturity date of the first delinquent installment, and thereafter may make a loan finance charge as authorized by the provisions on loan finance charge for consumer loans (W.S. 40-14-310) or the provisions on loan finance charge for supervised loans (W.S. 40-14-348), whichever is appropriate. The amount of the rebate shall not be reduced by the amount of any permitted minimum charge (W.S. 40-14-319). If the lender proceeds under this subsection, any delinquency or deferral charges made with respect to installments due at or after the maturity date of the first delinquent installment shall be rebated, and no further delinquency or deferral charges shall be made.</p>

                  <p>(a) With respect to a consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation, the parties before or after default may agree in writing to a deferral of all or part of one (1) or more unpaid installments, and the lender may make and collect a charge which the debtor expressly agrees to pay as consideration for a deferral. A deferral charge may be collected at the time it is assessed or at any time thereafter.</p>
                  <p>(b) The lender, in addition to the deferral charge, may make appropriate additional charges (W.S. 40-14-311), and the amount of these charges which is not paid in cash may be added to the amount deferred for the purpose of calculating the deferral charge.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except in connection with a revolving loan account, the parties may agree in writing at the time of a consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation that if an installment is not paid within ten (10) days after its due date, the lender may unilaterally grant a deferral and make charges as provided in this section. No deferral charge may be made for a period after the date that the lender elects to accelerate the maturity of the agreement.</p>
                  <p>(d) A delinquency charge made by the lender on an installment may not be retained if a deferral charge is made pursuant to this section with respect to the period of delinquency.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a debtor owes an unpaid balance to a lender with respect to a consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation, and becomes obligated on another consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation with the same lender, the parties may agree to a consolidation resulting in a single schedule of payments. If the previous consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation was not precomputed, the parties may agree to add the unpaid amount of principal and accrued charges on the date of consolidation to the principal with respect to the subsequent loan. If the previous consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation was precomputed, the parties may agree to refinance the unpaid balance pursuant to the provisions on refinancing (W.S. 40-14-314) and to consolidate the principal resulting from the refinancing by adding it to the principal with respect to the subsequent loan. In either case the lender may contract for and receive a loan finance charge based on the aggregate principal resulting from the consolidation at a rate not in excess of that permitted by the provisions on loan finance charge for consumer loans (W.S. 40-14-310) or the provisions on loan finance charge for supervised loans (W.S. 40-14-348), whichever is appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(b) The parties may agree to consolidate the unpaid balance of a consumer loan with the unpaid balance of a consumer credit sale. The parties may agree to refinance the previous unpaid balance pursuant to the provisions on refinancing sales (W.S. 40-14-216) or the provisions on refinancing loans (W.S. 40-14-314), whichever is appropriate, and to consolidate the amount financed resulting from the refinancing or the principal resulting from the refinancing by adding it to the amount financed or principal with respect to the subsequent sale or loan. The aggregate amount resulting from the consolidation shall be deemed principal, and the creditor may contract for and receive a loan finance charge based on the principal at a rate not in excess of that permitted by the provisions on loan finance charge for consumer loans (W.S. 40-14-310) or the provisions on loan finance charge for supervised loans (W.S. 40-14-348), whichever is appropriate.</p>

For the purpose of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) The unpaid balance of a consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation is an amount equal to the principal determined according to the provisions on refinancing (W.S. 40-14-314); and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The unpaid balance of a consumer credit sale, refinancing, or consolidation is an amount equal to the amount financed determined according to the provisions on refinancing (W.S. 40-14-216).</p>

                  <p>(a) If the agreement with respect to a consumer loan, refinancing, or consolidation contains covenants by the debtor to perform certain duties pertaining to insuring or preserving collateral and if the lender pursuant to the agreement pays for performance of the duties on behalf of the debtor, the lender may add the amounts paid to the debt. Within a reasonable time after advancing any sums, he shall state to the debtor in writing the amount of the sums advanced, any charges with respect to this amount, and any revised payment schedule and, if the duties of the debtor performed by the lender pertain to insurance, a brief description of the insurance paid for by the lender including the type and amount of coverages. No further information need be given.</p>
                  <p>(b) A loan finance charge may be made for sums advanced pursuant to subsection (a) of this section at a rate not exceeding the rate stated to the debtor pursuant to the laws relating to disclosure with respect to the loan, refinancing, or consolidation, except that with respect to a revolving loan account the amount of the advance may be added to the unpaid balance of the debt and the lender may make a loan finance charge not exceeding that permitted by the provisions on loan finance charge for consumer loans (W.S. 40-14-310) or for supervised loans (W.S. 40-14-348), whichever is appropriate.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, upon prepayment in full of the unpaid balance of a precomputed consumer loan, refinancing or consolidation, the unearned loan finance charge shall be refunded based on the Rule of 78's if the transaction under its original terms did not exceed sixty-one (61) monthly installments and upon the actuarial method, if the transaction by its original terms exceeded sixty-one (61) monthly installments. An amount not less than the unearned portion of the loan finance charge calculated according to this section shall be rebated to the debtor. With respect to irregular payment transactions, the administrator may prescribe by rule the refund formula. If the rebate otherwise required is less than one dollar ($1.00), no rebate need be made.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon prepayment in full of a consumer loan, other than one pursuant to a revolving loan account, a refinancing or consolidation, whether or not precomputed, the lender may collect or retain a minimum loan finance charge within the limits stated in W.S. 40-14-310(f).</p>
                  <p>(c) If a deferral (W.S. 40-14-313) has been agreed to, the unearned portion of the loan finance charge shall be computed without regard to the deferral. The amount of deferral charge earned at the date of prepayment shall also be calculated. If the deferral charge earned is less than the deferral charge paid, the difference shall be added to the unearned portion of the loan finance charge. If any part of a deferral charge has been earned but has not been paid, that part shall be subtracted from the unearned portion of the loan finance charge or shall be added to the unpaid balance.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section does not preclude the collection or retention by the lender of delinquency charges (W.S. 40-14-312).</p>
                  <p>(e) If the maturity is accelerated for any reason and judgment is obtained, the debtor is entitled to the same rebate as if the payment had been made on the date judgment is entered.</p>
                  <p>(f) Upon prepayment in full of a consumer loan by the proceeds of consumer credit insurance (W.S. 40-14-403), the debtor or his estate is entitled to the same rebate as though the debtor had prepaid the agreement on the date the proceeds of the insurance are paid to the lender, but no later than ten (10) business days after satisfactory proof of loss is furnished to the lender.</p>

                  <p>(ii) The administrator may authorize by rule the use of rate tables or charts which may provide for the disclosure of annual percentage rates which vary from the rate determined in accordance with paragraph (i) of this subsection by not more than the tolerances the administrator may allow; the administrator may not allow a tolerance greater than eight percent (8%) of that rate except to simplify compliance where irregular payments are involved; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) In case a lender determines the annual percentage rate in a manner other than as described in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subsection, the administrator may authorize by rule other reasonable tolerances.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a lender makes a change in the terms of a revolving loan account without complying with this section any additional cost or charge to the debtor resulting from the change is an excess charge and subject to the remedies available to debtors (W.S. 40-14-521) and to the administrator (W.S. 40-14-613).</p>

                  <p>(c) The notice specified in subsection (b) of this section is not required if notice of any proposed change in the terms of a revolving loan account is given to the customer at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such change or thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the billing cycle within which such change will become effective, whichever is the earlier date, and if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The debtor after receiving notice of the change agrees in writing to the change;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The debtor elects to pay an amount designated on a billing statement as including a new charge for a benefit offered to the debtor when the benefit and charge constitute the change in terms and when the billing statement also states the amount payable if the new charge is excluded;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The change involves no significant cost to the debtor;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The debtor has previously consented in writing to the kind of change made and notice of the change is given to the debtor in two (2) billing cycles prior to the effective date of the change; or</p>
                  <p>(v) The change applies only to debts incurred after a date specified in a notice of the change given in two (2) billing cycles prior to the effective date of the change.</p>

The excess amount of loan finance charge provided for in agreements in violation of this section is an excess charge for the purposes of the provisions on the effect of violations on rights of parties (W.S. 40-14-521) and the provisions on civil actions by administrator (W.S. 40-14-613).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>40-14-347. Repealed By Laws 1996 , ch. 86, § 3. 40-14-348. Loan finance charge.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) With respect to a supervised loan, including a loan pursuant to a revolving loan account, and except as provided for pawnbrokers under W.S. 40-14-360(a) and post-dated check cashers under W.S. 40-14-363(a), a supervised lender may contract for and receive a loan finance charge not exceeding that permitted by this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The loan finance charge, calculated according to the actuarial method, may not exceed:</p>
                  <p>(i) Where the initial principal does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), the equivalent of the greater of either of the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The total of: Thirty-six percent (36%) per year on that part of the unpaid balances of the principal which is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less and twenty-one percent (21%) per year on that part of the unpaid balances of the principal which is more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); or</p>
                  <p>(B) Twenty-one percent (21%) per year on that part of the unpaid balances of the principal.</p>
                  <p>(C) Repealed by Laws 1981, ch. 147, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Where the initial principal exceeds seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), any loan finance charge specified in the debtor's loan agreement.</p>
                  <p>(c) This section does not limit or restrict the manner of contracting for the loan finance charge, whether by way of add-on, discount, single annual percentage rate or otherwise, so long as the rate of the loan finance charge does not exceed that permitted by this section. The finance charge may be contracted for and earned at the single annual percentage rate that would earn the same finance charge as the graduated rates when the debt is paid according to the agreed terms and the calculations are made according to the actuarial method. If the loan is precomputed:</p>
                  <p>(i) The loan finance charge may be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled payments will be made when due; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The effect of prepayment is governed by the provisions on rebate upon prepayment (W.S. 40-14-319).</p>
                  <p>(d) The term of a loan for the purposes of this section commences on the date the loan is made. Differences in the lengths of months are disregarded and a day may be counted as one-thirtieth of a month. Subject to classifications and differentiations the lender may reasonably establish, a part of a month in excess of fifteen (15) days may be treated as a full month if periods of fifteen (15) days or less are disregarded and that procedure is not consistently used to obtain a greater yield than would otherwise be permitted.</p>
                  <p>(e) Subject to classifications and differentiations the lender may reasonably establish, he may make the same loan finance charge on all principal amounts within a specified range. A loan finance charge so made does not violate subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section, if:</p>
                  <p>(i) When applied to the median amount within each range, it does not exceed the maximum permitted in subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) When applied to the lowest amount within each range, it does not produce a rate of loan finance charge exceeding the rate calculated according to paragraph (b)(i) of this section by more than eight percent (8%) of the rate calculated according to paragraph (b)(i) of this section.</p>

The excess amount of loan finance charge provided for in agreements in violation of this section is an excess charge for the purposes of the provisions on effect of violations on rights of parties (W.S. 40-14-521) and the provisions on civil actions by administrator (W.S. 40-14-613).</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, a consumer who is unable to repay a post-dated check or similar arrangement when due may elect once every twelve (12) months to repay the post-dated check or similar arrangement by means of an extended payment plan. The twelve (12) month period shall be measured from the date the consumer pays in full one extended payment plan with the post-dated check casher until the date that the consumer enters into another extended payment plan with the post-dated check casher.</p>
                  <p>(b) To request an extended payment plan, the consumer, before 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on the last business day before the due date of the outstanding post-dated check or similar arrangement, shall request the plan and sign an amendment to the original agreement which memorializes the plan's terms.</p>
                  <p>(c) The extended payment plan's terms shall allow the consumer to repay the outstanding post-dated check or similar arrangement including any fee due in at least four (4) substantially equal installments and over a time period of at least sixty (60) days. Each plan installment shall be due on or after a date on which the consumer receives regular income, or if the consumer has no regular income due dates shall be a minimum of two (2) weeks between installments. The consumer may prepay an extended payment plan in full at any time without penalty. As long as the consumer complies with the terms of the extended payment plan, the plan shall be at no additional cost to the consumer and the post-dated check casher shall not charge the consumer any interest or additional fees during the term of the extended payment plan. The post-dated check casher may, with each payment under the plan by a consumer, provide for the return of the consumer's prior held check and require a new check for the remaining balance under the plan.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the consumer fails to pay any extended payment plan installment when due, the consumer shall be in default of the payment plan and the post-dated check casher immediately may accelerate payment on the remaining balance and take action to collect all amounts due. Upon default, notwithstanding W.S. 40-14-363(a), the post-dated check casher may charge the consumer interest on the outstanding balance at an annual rate equal to six percent (6%) plus the prime rate as listed in the Wall Street Journal on January 1 of the year in which the consumer defaults.</p>

                  <p>(c) This article supplements and does not repeal W.S. 26-21-101 through 26-22-101. The provisions of this act concerning administrative controls, liabilities, and penalties do not apply to persons acting as insurers, and the similar provisions of W.S. 26-21-101 through 26-21-114 and 26-23-201 do not apply to creditors and debtors.</p>

                  <p>(A) Insurance provided in relation to a credit transaction in which a payment is scheduled more than ten (10) years after the extension of credit;</p>
                  <p>(B) Insurance issued as an isolated transaction on the part of the insurer not related to an agreement or plan for insuring debtors of the creditor; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Insurance indemnifying the creditor against loss due to the debtor's default.</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Credit Insurance Act" means W.S. 26-21-101 through 26-21-114 and 26-23-201.</p>

                  <p>(b) The excess amount of a charge for insurance provided for in agreements in violation of this article is an excess charge for the purposes of the provisions of the article on remedies and penalties (article 5) as to effect of violations on rights of parties (W.S. 40-14-521) and of the provisions of the article on administration (article 6) as to civil actions by the administrator (W.S. 40-14-613).</p>

                  <p>(b) A creditor who provides consumer credit insurance in relation to a revolving charge account (W.S. 40-14-208) or revolving loan account (W.S. 40-14-308) may calculate the charge to the debtor in each billing cycle by applying the current premium rate to:</p>

                  <p>(ii) The unpaid balance of the debt or a median amount within a specified range of unpaid balances of debt on approximately the same day of the cycle.

                  <p>(a) Upon prepayment in full of a consumer credit sale or consumer loan by the proceeds of consumer credit insurance, the debtor or his estate is entitled to a refund of any portion of a separate charge for insurance which by reason of prepayment is retained by the creditor or returned to him by the insurer unless the charge was computed from time to time on the basis of the balances of the debtor's account.</p>
                  <p>(b) This article does not require a creditor to grant a refund or credit to the debtor if all refunds and credits due to the debtor under this article amount to less than one dollar ($1.00), and except as provided in subsection (a) of this section does not require the creditor to account to the debtor for any portion of a separate charge for insurance because:</p>
                  <p>(i) The insurance is terminated by performance of the insurer's obligation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The creditor pays or accounts for premiums to the insurer in amounts and at times determined by the agreement between them; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The creditor receives directly or indirectly under any policy of insurance a gain or advantage not prohibited by law.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the creditor shall promptly make or cause to be made an appropriate refund or credit to the debtor with respect to any separate charge made to him for insurance if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The insurance is not provided or is provided for a shorter term than that for which the charge to the debtor for insurance was computed; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The insurance terminates prior to the end of the term for which it was written because of prepayment in full or otherwise.</p>
                  <p>(d) A refund or credit required by subsection (c) of this section is appropriate as to amount if it is computed according to a method prescribed or approved by the commissioner of insurance or a formula filed by the insurer with the commissioner of insurance at least thirty (30) days before the debtor's right to a refund or credit becomes determinable, unless the method or formula is employed after the commissioner of insurance notifies the insurer that he disapproves it.</p>

                  <p>(a) Consumer credit insurance provided by a creditor may be subject to the furnishing of evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer. Whether or not such evidence is required, the term of the insurance shall commence no later than when the debtor becomes obligated to the creditor or when the debtor applies for the insurance, whichever is later, except as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If any required evidence of insurability is not furnished until more than thirty (30) days after the term would otherwise commence, the term may commence on the date when the insurer determines the evidence to be satisfactory; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the creditor provides insurance not previously provided covering debts previously created, the term may commence on the effective date of the policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) The originally scheduled term of the insurance shall extend at least until the due date of the last scheduled payment of the debt except as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the insurance relates to a revolving charge account or revolving loan account, the term need extend only until the payment of the debt under the account and may be sooner terminated after at least thirty (30) days notice to the debtor; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the debtor is advised in writing that the insurance will be written for a specified shorter time, the term need extend only until the end of the specified time.</p>
                  <p>(c) The term of the insurance shall not extend more than fifteen (15) days after the originally scheduled due date of the last scheduled payment of the debt unless it is extended without additional cost to the debtor or as an incident to a deferral, refinancing, or consolidation.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of consumer credit insurance providing life coverage, the amount of insurance may not initially exceed the debt and, if the debt is payable in installments, may not at any time exceed the greater of the scheduled or actual amount of the debt; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of any other consumer credit insurance, the total amount of periodic benefits payable may not exceed the total of scheduled unpaid installments of the debt, and the amount of any periodic benefit may not exceed the original amount of debt divided by the number of periodic installments in which it is payable.</p>
                  <p>(b) If consumer credit insurance is provided in connection with a revolving charge account or revolving loan account, the amounts payable as insurance benefits may be reasonably commensurate with the amount of debt as it exists from time to time. If consumer credit insurance is provided in connection with a commitment to grant credit in the future, the amounts payable as insurance benefits may be reasonably commensurate with the total from time to time of the amount of debt and the amount of the commitment.</p>

A creditor may not use a form or schedule unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The form or schedule has been on file with the commissioner of insurance for thirty (30) days, or has earlier been approved by him; and</p>

Within thirty (30) days after the filing of any form or schedule, he shall disapprove it if the premium rates or charges are unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided under the form, or if the form contains provisions which are unjust, unfair, inequitable, or deceptive, or encourage misrepresentation of the coverage, or are contrary to any provision of the Insurance Code or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a group policy has been delivered in another state, the forms to be filed by the insurer with the commissioner of insurance are the group certificates and notices of proposed insurance. He shall approve them if:</p>
                  <p>(i) They provide the information that would be required if the group policy were delivered in this state; and</p>

                  <p>(a) This section applies to a consumer credit sale of goods or services.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the seller repossesses or voluntarily accepts surrender of goods which were the subject of the sale and in which he has a security interest and the cash price of the goods repossessed or surrendered was one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, the buyer is not personally liable to the seller for the unpaid balance of the debt arising from the sale of the goods, and the seller is not obligated to resell the collateral.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the seller repossesses or voluntarily accepts surrender of goods which were not the subject of the sale but in which he has a security interest to secure a debt arising from a sale of goods or services or a combined sale of goods and services and the cash price of the sale was one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, the buyer is not personally liable to the seller for the unpaid balance of the debt arising from the sale.</p>
                  <p>(d) For the purpose of determining the unpaid balance of consolidated debts or debts pursuant to revolving charge accounts, the allocation of payments to a debt shall be determined in the same manner as provided for determining the amount of debt secured by various security interests (W.S. 40-14-243).</p>
                  <p>(e) The buyer may be liable in damages to the seller if the buyer has wrongfully damaged the collateral or if, after default and demand, the buyer has wrongfully failed to make the collateral available to the seller.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the seller elects to bring an action against the buyer for a debt arising from a consumer credit sale of goods or services, when under this section he would not be entitled to a deficiency judgment if he repossessed the collateral, and obtains judgment:</p>
                  <p>(i) He may not repossess the collateral; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The collateral is not subject to levy or sale on execution or similar proceedings pursuant to the judgment.</p>

                  <p>(a) For the purposes of this part:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Disposable earnings" means that part of the earnings of an individual remaining after the deduction from those earnings of amounts required by law to be withheld; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Garnishment" means any legal or equitable procedure through which the earnings of an individual are required to be withheld for payment of a debt.</p>
                  <p>(b) The maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any workweek which is subjected to garnishment to enforce payment of a judgment arising from a consumer credit sale, consumer lease, or consumer loan may not exceed the lesser of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Twenty-five percent (25%) of his disposable earnings for that week; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The amount by which his disposable earnings for that week exceed thirty (30) times the federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by section (6)(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, U.S.C. tit. 29, § 206(a)(1), in effect at the time the earnings are payable;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In the case of earnings for a pay period other than a week, the administrator shall prescribe by rule a multiple of the federal minimum hourly wage equivalent in effect to that set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) No court may make, execute, or enforce an order or process in violation of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) An individual's disposable earnings shall remain exempt to the extent provided in subsection (b) of this section if the earnings were deposited in the individual's account with a financial institution within twenty (20) calendar days prior to service of a writ of garnishment against the individual's account with the financial institution, on the day of service of the writ or within ten (10) business days after service of the writ. This subsection does not create any obligation on the part of a financial institution to conduct an investigation of the individual's account or otherwise make any determination about a judgment creditor's rights to funds in the account other than the financial institution's obligation to file with the court and serve on the individual an answer to the writ of garnishment. A judgment creditor may request that the court issue writs of garnishment to an individual's employer and the individual's financial institution at the same time; provided, however, that should the judgment creditor successfully garnish earnings as shown on an individual's pay advice, then the remaining proceeds from such pay advice deposited into an account with a financial institution shall be entirely exempt from execution, notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) As used in this section, "financial institution" means as defined in W.S. 13-1-401(a)(ii).</p>

                  <p>(a) If it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time an extension of credit is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person, the repayment of the extension of credit is unenforceable through civil judicial processes against the debtor.</p>
                  <p>(b) If it is shown that an extension of credit was made at an annual rate exceeding forty-five percent (45%) calculated according to the actuarial method and that the creditor then had a reputation for the use or threat of use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person to collect extensions of credit or to punish the nonrepayment thereof, there is prima facie evidence that the extension of credit was unenforceable under subsection</p>

                  <p>(a) With respect to a consumer credit sale, consumer lease, or consumer loan, if the court as a matter of law finds the agreement or any clause of the agreement to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the agreement, or it may enforce the remainder of the agreement without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.</p>
                  <p>(b) If it is claimed or appears to the court that the agreement or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its setting, purpose, and effect to aid the court in making the determination.</p>
                  <p>(c) For the purpose of this section, a charge or practice expressly permitted by this act is not in itself unconscionable.</p>

                  <p>(i) Consumer credit sale includes a sale of an interest in land without regard to the rate of the credit service charge if the sale is otherwise a consumer credit sale (W.S. 40-14-204); and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Consumer loan includes a loan primarily secured by an interest in land without regard to the rate of the loan finance charge if the loan is otherwise a consumer loan (W.S. 40-14-305).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>40-14-521. Effect of violations on rights of parties.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If a creditor has violated the provisions of this act applying to certain negotiable instruments (W.S. 40-14-237), or limitations on the schedule of payments or loan term for supervised loans (W.S. 40-14-351), the debtor is not obligated to pay the credit service charge or loan finance charge, and has a right to recover from the person violating this act or from an assignee of that person's rights who undertakes direct collection of payments or enforcement of rights arising from the debt a penalty in an amount determined by the court not in excess of three (3) times the amount of the credit service charge or loan finance charge. No action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement with respect to which the violation occurred.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a creditor has violated the provisions of this act applying to authority to make supervised loans (W.S. 40-14-342), the loan is void and the debtor is not obligated to pay either the principal or loan finance charge. If he has paid any part of the principal or of the loan finance charge, he has a right to recover the payment from the person violating this act or from an assignee of that person's rights who undertakes direct collection of payments or enforcement of rights arising from the debt. With respect to violations arising from other loans, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than two (2) years after the violation occurred. With respect to violations arising from other loans, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was paid.</p>
                  <p>(c) A debtor is not obligated to pay a charge in excess of that allowed by this act, and if he has paid an excess charge he has a right to a refund. A refund may be made by reducing the debtor's obligation by the amount of the excess charge. If the debtor has paid an amount in excess of the lawful obligation under the agreement, the debtor may recover the excess amount from the person who made the excess charge or from an assignee of that person's rights who undertakes direct collection of payments from or enforcement of rights against debtors arising from the debt.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a debtor is entitled to a refund and a person liable to the debtor refuses to make a refund within a reasonable time after demand, the debtor may recover from that person a penalty in an amount determined by a court not exceeding the greater of either the amount of the credit service or loan finance charge or ten (10) times the amount of the excess charge. If the creditor has made an excess charge in deliberate violation of or in reckless disregard for this act, the penalty may be recovered even though the creditor has refunded the excess charge. No penalty pursuant to this subsection may be recovered if a court has ordered a similar penalty assessed against the same person in a civil action by the administrator (W.S. 40-14-613). With respect to excess charges arising from sales made pursuant to revolving charge accounts or from loans made pursuant to revolving loan accounts, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than two (2) years after the time the excess charge was made. With respect to excess charges arising from other consumer credit sales or consumer loans, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was made.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided, no violation of this act impairs rights on a debt.</p>
                  <p>(f) If an employer discharges an employee in violation of the provisions prohibiting discharge (W.S. 40-14-506), the employee may within forty-five (45) days bring a civil action for recovery of wages lost as a result of the violation and for an order requiring the reinstatement of the employee. Damages recoverable shall not exceed lost wages for six (6) weeks.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the creditor establishes by a preponderance of evidence that a violation is unintentional or the result of a bona fide error, no liability is imposed under subsections (a), (b) and (d) of this section and the validity of the transaction is not affected.</p>
                  <p>(h) In any case in which it is found that a creditor has violated this act, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the debtor.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a creditor who, in violation of the laws relating to disclosure, other than the provisions on advertising (sections 2-313 and 3-312 [Repealed]), of the article on credit sales (article 2) and the article on loans (article 3), fails to disclose information to a person entitled to the information under this act is liable to that person in an amount equal to the sum of:</p>

                  <p>(ii) In the case of a successful action to enforce the liability under paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.</p>
                  <p>(b) A creditor has no liability under this section if within fifteen (15) days after discovering an error, and prior to the institution of an action under this section or the receipt of written notice of the error, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account are necessary to assure that the person will not be required to pay a credit service charge or loan finance charge in excess of the amount or percentage rate actually disclosed.</p>
                  <p>(c) A creditor may not be held liable in any action brought under this section for a violation of this act if the creditor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any action, which may be brought under this section against the original creditor in any credit transaction which does not involve a security interest in land, may be maintained against any subsequent assignee of the original creditor where the violation from which the alleged liability arose is apparent on the face of the instrument assigned unless the assignment is involuntary.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any action which may be brought under this section against the original creditor in any credit transaction involving a security interest in land may be maintained against any subsequent assignee of the original creditor where the assignee, its subsidiaries, or affiliates were in a continuing business relationship with the original creditor either at the time the credit was extended or at the time of the assignment, unless the assignment was involuntary, or the assignee shows by a preponderance of evidence that it did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the original creditor was engaged in violations of W.S. 40-14-101 through 40-14-702 and that it maintained procedures reasonably adapted to apprise it of the existence of the violations.</p>
                  <p>(f) No action pursuant to this section may be brought more than one (1) year after the date of the occurrence of the violation.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to other powers granted by this act, the administrator within the limitations provided by law may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Receive and act on complaints, take action designed to obtain voluntary compliance with this act, or commence proceedings on his own initiative;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Counsel persons and groups on their rights and duties under this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Establish programs for the education of consumers with respect to credit practices and problems;</p>

                  <p>(v) Adopt, amend, and repeal substantive rules when specifically authorized by this act, and adopt, amend, and repeal procedural rules to carry out the provisions of this act;</p>

                  <p>(vii) Require a licensee under this act or an applicant for a license issued under this act to submit to a background investigation including fingerprint checks for state, national and international criminal history record checks as necessary. While exercising his authority under this paragraph, the administrator may utilize background checks completed by the division of criminal investigation, other government agencies in this state or in other states, the federal bureau of investigation, the registry or another entity designated by the registry;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Determine the content of application forms and the means by which an applicant applies for, renews or amends a license under this act. The administrator may allow applicants to utilize the registry or an entity designated by the registry for the processing of applications and fees.</p>
                  <p>(b) The administrator may adopt rules not inconsistent with the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that a prospective debtor will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and to avoid the uninformed use of credit. These rules may contain classifications, differentiations or other provisions, and may provide for adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions subject to this act which in the judgment of the administrator are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes or to prevent circumvention or evasion of, or to facilitate compliance with, the provisions of this act relating to disclosure of credit terms.</p>
                  <p>(c) To keep the administrator's rules in harmony with the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and with the rules of administrators in other jurisdictions which enact the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, the administrator, so far as is consistent with the purposes, policies and provisions of this act, may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Before adopting, amending, and repealing rules, advise and consult with administrators in other jurisdictions which enact the Uniform Consumer Credit Code; and</p>

                  <p>(A) The regulations so prescribed by the consumer financial protection bureau; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The rules of administrators in other jurisdictions which enact the Uniform Consumer Credit Code.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except for return of an excess charge, no liability is imposed under this act for an act done or omitted in conformity with a rule of the administrator notwithstanding that after the act or omission the rule may be amended or repealed or be determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
                  <p>(e) The administrator shall, as required by W.S. 9-2-1014, report to the governor on the operation of his office, on the use of consumer credit in the state, and on the problems of persons of small means obtaining credit from persons regularly engaged in extending sales or loan credit. For the purpose of making the report, the administrator is authorized to conduct research and make appropriate studies. The report shall include a description of the examination and investigation procedures and policies of his office, a statement of policies followed in deciding whether to investigate or examine the offices of credit suppliers subject to this act, a statement of the number and percentages of offices which are periodically investigated or examined, a statement of the types of consumer credit problems of both creditors and debtors which have come to his attention through his examinations and investigations and the disposition of them under existing law and a general statement of the activities of his office and of others to promote the purposes of this act. The report shall not identify the creditors against whom action is taken by the administrator.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any person refusing or obstructing access to the administrator or representatives designated by the administrator to any accounts, books, records or papers, refusing to furnish any required information, or hindering a full examination or investigation of the accounts, books, records or papers, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), imprisonment for a period of not more than six (6) months, or both.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any person who wrongfully fails or refuses to comply with an order of the administrator as may be provided for under this act is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day the order is not complied with.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any person failing to submit reports to the administrator as may be required under this act is subject to a civil penalty of not more than ten dollars ($10.00) per day for each day the reports are delayed beyond the stated time the reports are required to be submitted.</p>
                  <p>(j) Reports required of persons by the administrator under this act and materials relating to examinations and investigations of persons subject to this act shall be subject to the provisions of W.S. 16-4-203(d)(v) and 9-1-512, as applicable.</p>

The administrator may request information about supervised financial organizations from the officials or agencies supervising them.</p>
                  <p>(c) The administrator and any official or agency of this state having supervisory authority over a supervised financial organization are authorized and directed to consult and assist one another in maintaining compliance with this act.

                  <p>(a) The administrator may conduct examinations of persons licensed under this act at intervals he deems necessary to determine whether violations of this act and other applicable laws, rules and regulations pertaining to consumer credit are occurring and the frequency and seriousness of such violations.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to the examinations provided for in subsection (a) of this section, if the administrator has probable cause to believe that a person has engaged in an act which is subject to action by the administrator, he may make an investigation to determine if the act has been committed, and, to the extent necessary for this purpose, may administer oaths or affirmations, and, upon his own motion or upon request of any party, may subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, adduce evidence, and require the production of any matter which is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts, or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the person's records are located outside this state, the person at his option shall either make them available at a location within this state convenient to the administrator or pay the reasonable and necessary expenses for the administrator or his representative to examine them at the place where they are maintained. For the purpose of this section, the administrator shall have free and reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, place of business and records of the person being examined or investigated. The administrator may designate representatives, including comparable officials of the state in which the records are located, to inspect them on his behalf.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon failure without lawful excuse to obey a subpoena or to give testimony and upon reasonable notice to all persons affected thereby, the administrator may apply to the district court for an order compelling compliance.</p>
                  <p>(e) The administrator shall not make public the name or identity of a person whose acts or conduct he investigates pursuant to this section or the facts disclosed in the investigation, but this subsection does not apply to disclosures in actions or enforcement proceedings pursuant to this act.</p>
                  <p>(f) Each licensee or person subject to examination or investigation under this act shall pay to the administrator an amount assessed by the administrator to cover the direct and indirect cost of examinations or investigations conducted pursuant to this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) After notice and hearing the administrator may order a creditor or a person acting in his behalf to cease and desist from engaging in violations of this act. A respondent aggrieved by an order of the administrator may obtain judicial review of the order and the administrator may obtain an order of the court for enforcement of its order in the district court. The proceeding for review or enforcement is initiated by filing a petition in the court. Copies of the petition shall be served upon all parties of record.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within thirty (30) days after service of the petition for review upon the administrator, or within any further time the court may allow, the administrator shall transmit to the court the original or a certified copy of the entire record upon which the order is based, including any transcript of testimony, which need not be printed. By stipulation of all parties to the review proceeding, the record may be shortened. After hearing, the court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Reverse or modify the order if the findings of fact of the administrator are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Grant any temporary relief or restraining order it deems just; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Enter an order enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the administrator, or remanding the case to the administrator for further proceedings.</p>
                  <p>(c) An objection not urged at the hearing shall not be considered by the court unless the failure to urge the objection is excused for good cause shown. A party may move the court to remand the case to the administrator in the interest of justice for the purpose of adducing additional specified and material evidence and seeking findings thereon upon good cause shown for the failure to adduce this evidence before the administrator.</p>
                  <p>(d) The jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its final judgment or decree shall be subject to review by the supreme court as provided by the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure and the Rules of the Supreme Court [by the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure]. The administrator's copy of the testimony shall be available at reasonable times to all parties for examination without cost.</p>
                  <p>(e) A proceeding for review under this section must be initiated within thirty (30) days after a copy of the order of the administrator is received by the creditor or person acting on his behalf. If no proceeding is so initiated, the administrator may obtain a decree of the district court for enforcement of its order upon a showing that the order was issued in compliance with this section, that no proceeding for review was initiated within thirty (30) days after copy of the order was received, and that the respondent is subject to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
                  <p>(f) With respect to unconscionable agreements or fraudulent or unconscionable conduct by the respondent, the administrator may not issue an order pursuant to this section but may bring a civil action for an injunction (W.S. 40-14-611).</p>

                  <p>(a) The administrator may bring a civil action to restrain a creditor or a person acting in his behalf from engaging in a course of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Making or enforcing unconscionable terms or provisions of consumer credit sales, consumer leases, or consumer loans;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Fraudulent or unconscionable conduct in inducing debtors to enter into consumer credit sales, consumer leases, or consumer loans; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Fraudulent or unconscionable conduct in the collection of debts arising from consumer credit sales, consumer leases, or consumer loans.</p>
                  <p>(b) In an action brought pursuant to this section the court may grant relief only if it finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) That the respondent has made unconscionable agreements or has engaged or is likely to engage in a course of fraudulent or unconscionable conduct;</p>
                  <p>(ii) That the agreements or conduct of the respondent has caused or is likely to cause injury to consumers; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) That the respondent has been able to cause or will be able to cause the injury primarily because the transactions involved are credit transactions.</p>
                  <p>(c) In applying this section, consideration shall be given to each of the following factors, among others:</p>
                  <p>(i) Belief by the creditor at the time consumer credit sales, consumer leases, or consumer loans are made that there was no reasonable probability of payment in full of the obligation by the debtor;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of consumer credit sales or consumer leases, knowledge by the seller or lessor at the time of the sale or lease of the inability of the buyer or lessee to receive substantial benefits from the property or services sold or leased;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In the case of consumer credit sales or consumer leases, gross disparity between the price of the property or services sold or leased and the value of the property or services measured by the price at which similar property or services are readily obtainable in credit transactions by like buyers or lessees;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The fact that the creditor contracted for or received separate charges for insurance with respect to consumer credit sales or consumer loans with the effect of making the sales or loans, considered as a whole, unconscionable; and</p>
                  <p>(v) The fact that the respondent has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the debtor reasonably to protect his interests by reason of physical or mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy or inability to understand the language of the agreement, or similar factors.</p>
                  <p>(d) In an action brought pursuant to this section, a charge or practice expressly permitted by this act is not in itself unconscionable.</p>

                  <p>(a) After demand, the administrator may bring a civil action against a creditor for making or collecting charges in excess of those permitted by this act. An action may relate to transactions with more than one (1) debtor. If it is found that an excess charge has been made, the court shall order the respondent to refund to the debtor or debtors the amount of the excess charge. If a creditor has made an excess charge in deliberate violation of or in reckless disregard for this act, or if a creditor has refused to refund an excess charge within a reasonable time after demand by the debtor or the administrator, the court may also order the respondent to pay to the debtor or debtors a civil penalty in an amount determined by the court not in excess of the greater of either the amount of the credit service or loan finance charge or ten (10) times the amount of the excess charge. Refunds and penalties to which the debtor is entitled pursuant to this subsection may be set off against the debtor's obligation. If a debtor brings an action against a creditor to recover an excess charge or civil penalty, an action by the administrator to recover for the same excess charge or civil penalty shall be stayed while the debtor's action is pending and shall be dismissed if the debtor's action is dismissed with prejudice or results in a final judgment granting or denying the debtor's claim. With respect to excess charges arising from sales made pursuant to revolving charge accounts or from loans made pursuant to revolving loan accounts, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than two (2) years after the time the excess charge was made. With respect to excess charges arising from other consumer credit sales or consumer loans, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was made. If the creditor establishes by a preponderance of evidence that a violation is unintentional or the result of a bona fide error, no liability to pay a penalty shall be imposed under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) The administrator may bring a civil action against a creditor or a person acting in his behalf to recover a civil penalty for willfully violating this act, and if the court finds that the defendant has engaged in a course of repeated and willful violations of this act, it may assess a civil penalty of no more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). No civil penalty pursuant to this subsection may be imposed for violations of this act occurring more than two (2) years before the action is brought or for making unconscionable agreements or engaging in a course of fraudulent or unconscionable conduct.</p>

                  <p>(a) The administrator, in carrying out enforcement activities under this section, in cases where an annual percentage rate or finance charge was inaccurately disclosed, shall notify the creditor of the disclosure error and is authorized, in accordance with this section, to require the creditor to make an adjustment to the account of the person to whom credit was extended, to assure that the person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower. For the purposes of this section, except where the disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in determining whether a disclosure error has occurred and in calculating any adjustment:</p>
                  <p>(i) The administrator shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(A) For transactions consummated after January 1, 1977, until March 31, 1982, with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance of one-quarter of one percent (.25%) more or less than the actual rate determined without regard to W.S. 40-14-225 and 40-14-323, except in the case of an irregular mortgage lending transaction consummated between January 1, 1977, and March 31, 1982, in which a tolerance of one-half of one percent (.5%) is allowed; and</p>
                  <p>(B) With respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerance provided under this section for the annual percentage rate, except that with respect to transactions consummated on or after April 1, 1982 the administrator shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(I) For transactions that have a scheduled amortization of ten (10) years or less with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance not to exceed one-quarter of one percent (.25%) more or less than the actual rate determined without regard to W.S. 40-14-225 and 40-14-323;</p>
                  <p>(II) For transactions that have a scheduled amortization of more than ten (10) years, with respect to the annual percentage rate, only such tolerances as are allowed under W.S. 40-14-225 and 40-14-323; and</p>
                  <p>(III) For all transactions, with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerances provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate.</p>
                  <p>(b) The administrator shall require an adjustment when he determines that the disclosure error resulted from a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violations, gross negligence or a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom the credit was extended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except where the disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, the administrator need not require such an adjustment if he determines that the disclosure error:</p>
                  <p>(i) Resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the finance charge, including but not limited to violations involving the disclosures described in rules adopted by the administrator in which event the administrator may require such remedial action as he determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consummated on or after April 1, 1982 the adjustment shall be ordered for violations of W.S. 40-14-213(b) and 40-14-311(b);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Involved a disclosed amount which was ten percent (10%) or less of the amount that should have been disclosed and, in cases where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and, in cases where the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, the finance charge was disclosed correctly, in which event the administrator may require such adjustment as he determines to be equitable;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Involved a total failure to disclose either the annual percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the administrator may require any adjustment as he determines to be equitable; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Resulted from any other unique circumstance involving clearly technical and nonsubstantive disclosure violations that do not adversely affect information provided to the consumer and that have not misled or otherwise deceived the consumer.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the case of other disclosure errors, the administrator may require such an adjustment.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, no adjustment shall be ordered:</p>
                  <p>(i) If it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but, in any such case, the administrator may require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such an impact, except that, with respect to any transaction consummated after the effective date of this section, the administrator shall require the full adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment in partial payments over an extended period of time which the administrator considers to be reasonable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the amount of the adjustment would be less than one dollar ($1.00), except that if more than one (1) year has elapsed since the date of the violation, the administrator may require that the amount shall be paid into the state treasury; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except where disclosure error resulted from a willful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two (2) years after the violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) With respect to creditors that are subject to examination by the administrator, except in connection with violations arising from practices identified in the current examination and only in connection with transactions that are consummated after the date of the immediately preceding examination, except that where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those violations shall be required in connection with transactions consummated after the date of the examination in which the practices were first identified;</p>
                  <p>(B) With respect to creditors that are not subject to examination by the administrator, except in connection with transactions that are consummated after March 31, 1980; and</p>
                  <p>(C) In no event after the later of the expiration of the life of the credit extension or two (2) years after the agreement to extend credit was consummated.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an adjustment under this subsection may be required by the administrator only by an order issued in accordance with the rules and regulations of the administrator pursuant to this act.</p>
                  <p>(f) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the administrator may not require a creditor to make dollar adjustments for errors in any requirements under this act except as otherwise specifically provided.</p>
                  <p>(g) A creditor is not subject to an order to make an adjustment, if, within sixty (60) days after discovering a disclosure error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or through the creditor's own procedures, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and adjusts the account so as to assure that the person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>
                  <p>(h) Notwithstanding the second sentence of subsection (a), subparagraph (d)(iii)(A) and subparagraph (d)(iii)(B) of this section, the administrator shall require an adjustment for an annual percentage rate disclosure error that exceeds a tolerance of one-quarter of one percent (.25%) less than the actual rate determined without regard to W.S. 40-14-225 and 40-14-323, except in the case of an irregular mortgage lending transaction with respect to any transaction consummated between January 1, 1977 and March 31, 1980.</p>

                  <p>(a) A person required to file notification shall on or before January 31 of each year pay to the administrator an annual fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for that year.</p>
                  <p>(b) Persons required to file notification who are sellers, lessors or lenders shall pay an additional fee at the time and in the manner stated in subsection (a) of this section of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), or part thereof, in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), of the original unpaid balances arising from consumer credit sales, consumer leases and consumer loans made in this state within the preceding calendar year and held either by the seller, lessor or lender for more than thirty (30) days after the inception of the sale, lease or loan giving rise to the obligations, or by an assignee who has not filed notification. A refinancing of a sale, lease or loan resulting in an increase in the amount of an obligation is considered a new sale, lease or loan to the extent of the amount of the increase. The administrator may by rule increase this fee to an amount not greater than thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), or part thereof, in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) of the original unpaid balances if he determines that an increase is necessary to cover the cost of administration of this act.</p>

The administrator may by rule increase this fee to an amount not greater than thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), or part thereof, in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) if he determines that an increase is necessary to cover the cost of administration of this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) The administrator shall receive and act on all applications for licenses required under this act. Applications shall be filed in the manner prescribed by the administrator and shall contain the information the administrator requires by rule to make an evaluation of the financial responsibility, character and business qualifications of the applicant.</p>
                  <p>(b) The administrator shall issue a license unless, upon investigation, he finds that the financial responsibility, character and business qualifications of the applicant, and of the members thereof, if the applicant is a partnership or association, and of the officers and directors thereof if the applicant is a corporation, are such as to warrant belief that the business will not be operated honestly and fairly within the purposes of this act.</p>
                  <p>(c) The application for one (1) or more licenses shall be accompanied by a processing fee not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each license applied for, as set by rule of the administrator. If the expenses of the investigation and evaluation exceed the amount of the fee, the applicant shall reimburse the administrator the excess amount. If the expenses of the investigation and evaluation are less than the amount of the fee or if the application is withdrawn prior to the completion of the investigation and evaluation, the unexpended amount shall remain in the consumer credit administration account to be expended in accordance with W.S. 40-14-633.</p>
                  <p>(d) An applicant shall be notified when the application is approved. Within twenty (20) days after notification, the applicant shall pay an initial license fee not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), as set by rule of the administrator.</p>
                  <p>(e) Each office or place of business shall be licensed separately.</p>
                  <p>(f) The license shall be prominently displayed at the place of business named in the license. The license shall not be transferable or assignable.</p>
                  <p>(g) If a licensee wishes to move his office to another location, the licensee shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Give at least thirty (30) days written notice to the administrator; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Pay a license modification fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), as set by rule of the administrator.</p>
                  <p>(h) Each license issued under this act shall expire on December 31. The license shall be renewed annually not less than thirty (30) days before the stated expiration date. The renewal fee for each license shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), as set by rule of the administrator.</p>
                  <p>(j) Upon written request, the applicant is entitled to a hearing on the question of his qualifications for a license if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The administrator has notified the applicant in writing that his application has been denied; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The administrator has not issued a license within sixty (60) days after the application for the license was filed. A request for a hearing may not be made more than fifteen (15) days after the administrator has mailed a writing to the applicant notifying him that the application has been denied and stating in substance the administrator's findings supporting denial of the application.</p>
                  <p>(k) The administrator may establish different fees authorized under this section for each category of licensee. The administrator shall establish fees in accordance with the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Fees shall be established by rule or regulation promulgated in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Fees shall be established in an amount to ensure that, to the extent practicable, the total revenue generated from the fees collected approximates, but does not exceed, the direct and indirect costs of administering the regulatory provisions required under this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The administrator shall maintain records sufficient to support the fees charged.</p>
                  <p>(m) A license shall not be issued under subsection (b) of this section if the applicant has been convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony in a domestic, foreign or military court during the seven (7) year period preceding the date of the application for licensing, or at any time preceding such date of application if such felony involved an act of fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering.</p>
                  <p>(n) A license may be issued at the discretion of the administrator under subsection (b) of this section if the applicant has been convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to a misdemeanor in a domestic, foreign or military court involving an act of fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering.</p>
                  <p>(o) In order to fulfill the purposes of this act, the administrator may establish relationships or contract with the registry or any other entity designated by the registry to collect and maintain records and process transaction fees or other fees related to licensees or other persons subject to this act.</p>
                  <p>(p) In addition to the other requirements of this section, in connection with an application for licensing, the applicant shall, at a minimum, furnish to the administrator or the registry information concerning the identity of the applicant, the owners or persons in charge of the applicant and individuals designated in charge of the applicant's places of business, including:</p>
                  <p>(i) Fingerprints for submission to the federal bureau of investigation, and any governmental agency or entity authorized to receive such information for a state, national and international criminal history background check; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Personal history and experience, including the submission of authorization for the registry or the administrator to obtain:</p>
                  <p>(A) An independent credit report obtained from a consumer reporting agency described in section 603(p) of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Information related to any administrative, civil or criminal findings by any governmental jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(q) For the purposes of this section and in order to reduce the points of contact which the federal bureau of investigation may have to maintain for purposes of paragraph (p)(i) of this section and subparagraph (p)(ii)(B) of this section, the administrator may use the registry as a channeling agent for requesting information from and distributing information to the department of justice or any governmental agency.</p>
                  <p>(r) For the purposes of this section and in order to reduce the points of contact which the administrator may have to maintain for purposes of paragraph (p)(ii) of this section, the administrator may use the registry as a channeling agent for requesting and distributing information to and from any source as directed by the administrator.</p>

                  <p>(a) The administrator may issue to a person licensed under this act an order to show cause why his license should not be revoked or suspended for a period not in excess of six (6) months. The order shall state the place for a hearing and set a time for the hearing that is no less than ten (10) days from the date of the order. After the hearing the administrator shall revoke or suspend the license if he finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The licensee has repeatedly and willfully violated this act or any rule or order lawfully made pursuant to this act; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Facts or conditions exist which would clearly have justified the administrator in refusing to grant a license had these facts or conditions been known to exist at the time the application for the license was made.</p>
                  <p>(b) No revocation or suspension of a license is lawful unless prior to institution of proceedings by the administrator notice is given to the licensee of the facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee is given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for retention of the license.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the administrator finds that probable cause for revocation of a license exists and that enforcement of this act requires immediate suspension of a license pending investigation, he may, after a hearing upon five (5) days written notice, enter an order suspending the license for not more than thirty (30) days.</p>
                  <p>(d) Whenever the administrator revokes or suspends a license, he shall enter an order to that effect and forthwith notify the licensee of the revocation or suspension. Within five (5) days after the entry of the order he shall deliver to the licensee a copy of the order and the findings supporting the order.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any person holding a license under this act may relinquish the license by notifying the administrator in writing of its relinquishment, but this relinquishment shall not affect his liability for acts previously committed.</p>
                  <p>(f) No revocation, suspension or relinquishment of a license shall impair or affect the obligation of any preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and any consumer.</p>
                  <p>(g) The administrator may reinstate a license, terminate a suspension or grant a new license to a person whose license has been revoked or suspended if no fact or condition then exists which clearly would have justified the administrator in refusing to grant a license.</p>
                  <p>(h) For purposes of this section, "licensee" shall also mean a licensed mortgage loan originator pursuant to W.S. 40-14-641.</p>

                  <p>(b) Every licensee shall maintain records in a manner that will enable the administrator to determine whether the licensee is complying with the provisions of this act. The administrator may by rule, and in accordance with W.S. 40-14-606(c), specify the manner in which records are to be made available. The records need not be kept in the place of business of the licensee, if the administrator is given free access to the records wherever located. The records pertaining to any transaction governed by this act need not be preserved for more than two (2) years after making the final entry relating to the transaction. In the case of a revolving loan account the two (2) years is measured from the date of each entry.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided in subsections (d), (e) and (j) of this section, all information or reports obtained by the administrator from an applicant or licensee are confidential.</p>

                  <p>Such information and any other confidential material obtained by the administrator may be shared with all state and federal regulatory officials with mortgage industry oversight authority without the loss of privilege or the loss of confidentiality protections provided by federal or state law.</p>
                  <p>(e) The administrator may enter into cooperative, coordinating or information sharing agreements with any other supervisory agency or any organization affiliated with or representing one (1) or more supervisory agencies with respect to the periodic examination or other supervision of any office in Wyoming of an out-of-state licensee, and the administrator may accept the parties' reports of examination and reports of investigation in lieu of conducting his own examinations or investigations.</p>
                  <p>(f) Information or material that is subject to a privilege or confidentiality protection under subsection (d) of this section shall not be subject to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Disclosure under any federal or state law governing the disclosure to the public of information held by an officer or agency of the federal government or the respective state; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subpoena, discovery or admission into evidence, in any private civil action or administrative process, unless with respect to any privilege held by the registry with respect to such information or material, the person to whom such information or material pertains waives that privilege, in whole or in part.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any Wyoming law relating to the disclosure of confidential supervisory information or any information or material described in subsection (d) of this section that is inconsistent with subsection (d) of this section shall be superceded by the requirements of this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) This section shall not apply with respect to the information or material relating to the employment history of, and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against, mortgage loan originator that is included in the registry for access by the public.</p>
                  <p>(j) The administrator may enter into contracts with any supervisory agency having concurrent jurisdiction over a Wyoming licensee pursuant to this act to engage the services of the agency's examiners at a reasonable rate of compensation. Any contract under this subsection shall not be subject to the provisions of W.S. 9-2-1016(b).</p>

                  <p>(a) Any organization employing or contracting with a mortgage loan originator shall maintain a surety bond to the state of Wyoming in accordance with this section. The surety bond shall be used to cover individual mortgage loan originators employed by or under contract with the organization. The amount of the bond shall be established by rule of the administrator based upon the volume of residential mortgage loan activity transacted by the organization under this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The surety bond shall be a continuing obligation of the issuing surety. The surety's liability under the bond for any claims made under the bond either individually or in the aggregate shall in no event exceed the face amount of the bond issued. The bond shall be issued by a surety authorized to do business in the state of Wyoming. The bond, including any and all riders and endorsements executed subsequent to the effective date of the bond, shall be placed on file with the administrator.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event an organization or mortgage loan originator employed by or under contract with an organization has violated any of the provisions of this act or a rule or order lawfully made pursuant to this act pertaining to a residential mortgage loan transaction, or federal law or regulation pertaining to the mortgage lending or mortgage brokering, and has damaged any person by such violation, then the bond shall be forfeited and paid by the surety to the state of Wyoming for the benefit of any person so damaged, in an amount sufficient to satisfy the violation or the bond in its entirety if the violation exceeds the amount of the bond.</p>
                  <p>(d) Surety bonds shall remain effective continuously until released in writing by the administrator. If a bond has not been previously released by the administrator, the bond shall expire two (2) years after the date of the surrender, revocation or expiration of the license.</p>

                <p>(A) Who purchases a motor vehicle, other than for the purpose of resale, to which an express warranty applies; or</p>
                <p>(B) To whom a motor vehicle is transferred during the term of an express warranty applicable to the motor vehicle; or</p>

                <p>(ii) "Motor vehicle" means every vehicle under ten thousand (10,000) pounds unladen weight, sold or registered in the state, which is self-propelled except vehicles moved solely by human power;</p>

The necessary repairs shall be made even if the one (1) year period has expired.</p>
                <p>(c) If the manufacturer, its agents or authorized dealers are unable to conform the motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition which substantially impairs the use and fair market value of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall:</p>

                <p>(a) In any rental-purchase agreement, after a consumer is in default for three (3) business days or more and does not voluntarily surrender possession of the rented property, a merchant may give the consumer the notice provided in this section. Notice may be given to the consumer under this section by the merchant personally delivering the notice to the consumer or by mailing the notice to the consumer's last known residential address.</p>
                <p>(b) The notice shall be in writing and conspicuously state the name, address and telephone number of the merchant to whom payment is made, a brief identification of the transaction, the consumer's right to cure any default, the amount of payment and the date the payment shall be made to cure the default. The notice shall be in substantially the form required by rule of the administrator.</p>
                <p>(c) With respect to rental-purchase agreements with payments or options to renew more frequently than monthly, after default consisting of failure to renew or return the property, a merchant may not initiate court action to recover rented property until three (3) business days after notice of the consumer's right to cure is given. With respect to all other rental-purchase agreements, after default consisting of failure to renew or return the property, a merchant may not initiate court action to recover rented property until five (5) business days after notice of the consumer's right to cure is given.</p>
                <p>(d) After notice is given and until expiration of the minimum applicable period, a consumer may cure all defaults consisting of failure to renew and failure to return the property by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due and payment of a renewal payment.</p>
                <p>(e) This section shall not prohibit a consumer from voluntarily surrendering possession of property that is rented or a merchant from requesting and accepting surrender of property at any time after default. In any enforcement proceeding, a merchant shall affirmatively plead and prove either that the notice to cure is not required or that the merchant has given the required notice. The failure to plead shall not invalidate any action taken by the merchant that is otherwise lawful and if the merchant had rightfully repossessed the property the repossession shall not constitute conversion.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>40-19-110. Reinstatement.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Any consumer whose default consists solely of a failure to make a timely rental payment may reinstate the agreement, without losing any rights or options which exist under the agreement, by paying the following charges within seven (7) days of the renewal date of the agreement:</p>
                <p>(i) All past due rental charges;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the property has been picked-up, the reasonable costs of pickup and redelivery as limited by W.S. 40-19-108(a)(xi); and</p>
                <p>(iii) Any applicable reinstatement fee as limited by W.S. 40-19-108(a)(x) and (xi).</p>
                <p>(b) In the case of a consumer who has paid less than two-thirds (2/3) of the total of payments necessary to acquire ownership and where the consumer has returned or voluntarily surrendered the property within seven (7) days of the renewal date, other than through judicial process, the consumer may reinstate the agreement during a period of not less than twenty-one (21) days after the date of the return of the property.</p>
                <p>(c) In the case of a consumer who has paid two-thirds (2/3) or more of the total of payments necessary to acquire ownership, and where the consumer has returned or voluntarily surrendered the property within seven (7) days of the renewal date, other than through judicial process, the consumer may reinstate the agreement during a period of not less than thirty (30) days after the date of the return of the property.</p>
                <p>(d) Nothing in this section shall prevent a merchant from attempting to repossess the property. Repossession within seven (7) days of the renewal date shall not affect the consumer's right to reinstate. Upon reinstatement, the merchant shall provide the consumer with the same property, if available, or with substitute property of comparable quality and condition.</p>

                <p>(a) A renegotiation occurs when any term of a rental-purchase agreement that is required to be disclosed by W.S. 40-19-107 is changed by agreement between the merchant and consumer. A renegotiation is considered to be a new rental-purchase agreement requiring the merchant to give all the disclosures required by W.S. 40-19-107.</p>

                <p>(a) Any person acting as a merchant, as defined by W.S. 40-19-102(a)(viii), in this state shall be licensed to conduct such business under this section.</p>
                <p>(b) The administrator shall receive and act on all applications for licenses required under this act. Applications shall be filed in the manner prescribed by the administrator and shall contain the information the administrator requires by rule to make an investigation and evaluation of the financial responsibility, experience and business qualification of the applicant, and of the partners or members if the applicant is a partnership or association, and of the principal officers and directors if the applicant is a corporation, such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly and fairly within the purposes of this act.</p>
                <p>(c) The application for one (1) or more licenses shall be accompanied by a processing fee not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) set by rule of the administrator. The fee shall be deposited by the administrator with the state treasurer and credited to the financial institutions administration account. Funds from the account shall be expended to carry out the duties of the administrator. If the expenses of the investigation and evaluation exceed the amount of the fee, the applicant shall reimburse the administrator the excess amount. If the expenses of the investigation and evaluation are less than the amount of the fee, the unexpended amount shall remain within the account. If an application is withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to the completion of the investigation and evaluation, the unexpended amount shall remain within the account.</p>
                <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided, fees collected by the administrator under this act shall be deposited by the administrator with the state treasurer and credited to the financial institutions administration account. Expenditures shall be made from the account by warrants drawn by the state auditor, upon vouchers issued and signed by the administrator. The funds deposited in the account under this act shall be expended only to carry out the duties of the administrator.</p>
                <p>(e) The applicant shall be notified when the application is approved. Within twenty (20) days after notification, the applicant shall pay an initial license fee not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), as set by rule of the administrator.</p>
                <p>(f) Each office or place of business shall be licensed separately.</p>
                <p>(g) Each license shall state the address of the office from which the business is to be conducted and the name of the licensee. The license shall be prominently displayed at the place of business named in the license. The license shall not be transferable or assignable.</p>
                <p>(h) If a licensee wishes to move his office to another location, the licensee shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Give written notice to the administrator at least thirty (30) days prior to the move; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Pay a license modification fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), as set by rule of the administrator.</p>
                <p>(j) Each license issued under this section shall expire on July 1. The license shall be renewed annually not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration date.

                <p>(a) The administrator may issue to a person licensed under this act an order to show cause why his license should not be revoked or suspended for a period not in excess of six (6) months. The order shall state the place for a hearing and set a time for the hearing that is no less than ten (10) days from the date of the order. After the hearing the administrator shall revoke or suspend the license if he finds that:</p>
                <p>(i) The licensee has repeatedly and willfully violated this act or any rule or order lawfully made pursuant to this act; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Facts or conditions exist which would clearly have justified the administrator in refusing to grant a license had these facts or conditions been known to exist at the time the application for the license was made.</p>
                <p>(b) No revocation or suspension of a license is lawful unless prior to institution of proceedings by the administrator notice is given to the licensee of the facts or conduct which warrant the intended action and the licensee is given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for retention of the license.</p>
                <p>(c) If the administrator finds that probable cause for revocation of a license exists and that enforcement of this act requires immediate suspension of a license pending investigation, he may, after a hearing upon five (5) days written notice, enter an order suspending the license for not more than thirty (30) days.</p>
                <p>(d) Whenever the administrator revokes or suspends a license, he shall enter an order to that effect and immediately notify the licensee of the revocation or suspension. Within five (5) days after the entry of the order he shall deliver to the licensee a copy of the order and the findings supporting the order.</p>
                <p>(e) Any person holding a license under this act may relinquish the license by notifying the administrator in writing of its relinquishment, but this relinquishment shall not affect his liability for acts previously committed.</p>
                <p>(f) No revocation, suspension or relinquishment of a license shall impair or affect the obligation of any preexisting lawful contract between the licensee and any consumer.</p>
                <p>(g) The administrator may reinstate a license, terminate a suspension or grant a new license to a person whose license has been revoked or suspended if no fact or condition then exists which clearly would have justified the administrator in refusing to grant a license.</p>

For these purposes he shall have free and reasonable access during normal office hours to the offices, places of business and records of the licensee. Each licensee shall pay to the administrator an amount assessed by the administrator to cover the direct and indirect cost of an investigation under this subsection.</p>
                <p>(b) For the purposes of this section, the administrator may administer oaths or affirmations, and upon his own motion or upon request of any party may subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, adduce evidence and require the production of any matter which is relevant to the investigation, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents or other tangible things and the identity and location of person having knowledge of relevant facts or any other matter reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>

                <p>(b) In the case of an advertisement, any merchant who fails to comply with the requirements of W.S. 40-19-113 with regard to any consumer shall be liable to that consumer for actual damages suffered from the violation, the costs of the action and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>

                <p>(a) Unless this section is specifically waived in writing by the dealer, a supplier shall allow a dealer to periodically, but no less than once every twelve (12) months, return a portion of the dealer's surplus parts inventory for credit.</p>
                <p>(b) The supplier shall notify the dealer of a time period during which a dealer may submit the dealer's surplus parts list and return inventory. A supplier may stagger return periods for its dealers.</p>
                <p>(c) If a supplier has not notified its dealer of a specific time period for returning surplus parts within the preceding twelve (12) month period, it shall allow the dealer to return surplus parts within sixty (60) days of receiving the dealer's request to make such return.</p>
                <p>(d) A supplier shall allow surplus parts return on a dollar value of parts equal to ten percent (10%) of the total dollar value of all parts purchased by the dealer from the supplier during either the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the supplier's notification to the dealer of the supplier's return program or, if subsection (c) of this section applies, the month the dealer makes a return request.</p>
                <p>(e) The dealer may elect to return a dollar value of the surplus parts equal to less than ten percent (10%) of the total dollar value of the parts the dealer purchased during the preceding twelve (12) months.</p>
                <p>(f) A dealer may not return obsolete parts. However, a dealer may return a part for credit if such part is found in the supplier's current parts list or any superseded part that is not the subject of the supplier's parts return program as of the date of termination.</p>
                <p>(g) A dealer shall return only new and unused parts to the supplier of the parts.</p>
                <p>(h) The minimum credit allowed for returned parts shall be ninety-five percent (95%) of the net price as listed in the supplier's current parts list as of the date that the supplier provides notice of its return program or, if subsection (c) of this section applies, the date that the dealer submits a request for return.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>40-20-114. Violations of chapter.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) It shall be a violation of this chapter for a supplier to take any one (1) or more of the following actions:</p>
                <p>(i) To coerce, compel or require any dealer to accept delivery of any equipment or repair parts which the dealer has not voluntarily ordered, except as required by any applicable law or unless the equipment or repair parts are safety features required by a supplier;</p>
                <p>(ii) To require any dealer to purchase goods or services as a condition to the sale by the supplier to the dealer of any equipment, repair parts or other goods or services, except that nothing herein shall prohibit a supplier from requiring the dealer to purchase all repair parts, special tools and training reasonably necessary to maintain the safe operation or quality of operation in the field of any equipment offered for sale by the dealer;</p>
                <p>(iii) To coerce any dealer into a refusal to purchase equipment manufactured by another supplier. However, it shall not be a violation of this section to require separate facilities, financial statements, or sales staff for major competing lines so long as the dealer is given at least three (3) years notice of such requirement;</p>
                <p>(iv) To refuse to deliver in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time, after receipt of the dealer's order, to any dealer having a dealer agreement for the retail sale of new equipment sold or distributed by the supplier, equipment covered by the dealer agreement specifically advertised or represented by the supplier to be available for immediate delivery. The failure to deliver the equipment shall not be considered a violation of this chapter if the failure is due to prudent and reasonable restrictions on extensions of credit by the supplier to the dealer, an act of God, work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, freight embargo, or other cause over which the supplier has no control or a business decision by the supplier to limit the production volume of the equipment;</p>
                <p>(v) To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in filling an order placed by a dealer for retail sale or lease of new equipment under a dealer agreement as between dealers of the same product line;</p>
                <p>(vi) To discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price between different dealers with respect to purchases of equipment or repair parts of like grade and quality and identical brand, where the effect of the discrimination may be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce or injure, destroy or prevent competition with any dealer who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of the discrimination. Different prices may be charged if:</p>
                <p>(A) The differences are due to differences in the cost of manufacture, sale or delivery of the equipment or repair parts;</p>
                <p>(B) The supplier can show that the lower price was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor; or</p>

                <p><shortTitle>40-20-115. Termination of dealer agreements.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A dealer may terminate a dealer agreement without cause. The dealer shall give the supplier at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of termination. No supplier may terminate a dealer agreement without good cause. Notice from the supplier to the dealer shall be as provided in W.S. 40-20-116 and 40-20-117. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, good cause means the failure by a dealer to substantially comply with essential and reasonable requirements imposed upon the dealer by the dealer agreement, provided the requirements are not different from those requirements imposed on other similarly situated dealers either by their terms or in the manner of their enforcement. In addition, good cause shall exist whenever:</p>
                <p>(i) The dealer or dealership has transferred a controlling ownership interest in its business without the supplier's consent;</p>
                <p>(ii) The dealer has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it which has not been discharged within thirty (30) days after the filing, there has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the dealer's assets related to the business or there has been a commencement of dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;</p>
                <p>(iii) There has been a deletion, addition or change in dealer or dealership locations without the prior written approval of the supplier;</p>
                <p>(iv) The dealer has defaulted under any chattel mortgage or other security agreement between the dealer and the supplier or there has been a revocation of any guarantee of the dealer's present or future obligations to the supplier. Good cause shall not exist if a person revokes any guarantee in connection with or following the transfer of the person's entire ownership interest in the dealer unless the supplier requires the new person to execute a new guarantee of the dealer's present or future obligations in connection with the transfer of ownership interest;</p>
                <p>(v) The dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of business for seven (7) consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned its business;</p>
                <p>(vi) The dealer has pleaded guilty to or has been convicted of a felony affecting the relationship between the dealer and supplier;</p>
                <p>(vii) The dealer has engaged in conduct which is injurious or detrimental to the dealer's customers or to the public welfare or the representation or reputation of the supplier's product;</p>
                <p>(viii) The dealer has consistently failed to meet and maintain the supplier's requirements for reasonable standards and performance objectives, so long as the supplier has given the dealer reasonable standards and performance objectives that are based on the manufacturer's experience in other comparable market areas.</p>
                <p>(b) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the dealer agreements between a single line dealer and the single line supplier.</p>

                <p>(a) This section shall only apply to the dealer agreements between a single line dealer and a single line supplier.</p>
                <p>(b) No supplier may terminate a dealer agreement without good cause. For purposes of this section and W.S. 40-20-118 only, good cause means failure by a dealer to comply with requirements imposed upon the dealer by the dealer agreement if the requirements are not different from those imposed on other similarly situated dealers. In addition, good cause exists when:</p>
                <p>(i) There has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the dealer's assets related to the equipment business or there has been a commencement of a dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;</p>
                <p>(ii) The dealer has changed its principal place of business or added additional locations without prior approval of the supplier, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;</p>
                <p>(iii) The dealer has substantially defaulted under a chattel mortgage or other security agreement between the dealer and the supplier or there has been a revocation or discontinuance of a guarantee of a present or future obligation of the dealer to the supplier;</p>
                <p>(iv) The dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of business for seven (7) consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned its business;</p>
                <p>(v) The dealer has pleaded guilty to or has been convicted of a felony affecting the relationship between the dealer and the supplier; or</p>
                <p>(vi) The dealer transfers an interest in the dealership, or a person with a substantial interest in the ownership or control of the dealership, including an individual proprietor, partner or major shareholder withdraws from the dealership, dies or a substantial reduction occurs in the interest of a partner or major shareholder in the dealership. Good cause does not exist if the supplier consents to an action described in this paragraph.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a supplier shall provide a dealer with at least ninety (90) days written notice of termination. The notice shall state all reasons constituting good cause for the termination and shall state the dealer has sixty (60) days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the deficiency is cured within sixty (60) days, the notice shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the good cause for termination is due to the dealer's failure to meet or maintain the supplier's requirements for market penetration, a reasonable period of time shall have existed where the supplier has worked with the dealer to gain the desired market share. The notice and right to cure provisions under this subsection shall not apply if the reason for termination is for any reason set forth in paragraphs (b)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a supplier shall provide a dealer at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice of termination of a dealer agreement. The notice shall state all reasons constituting good cause for the termination and shall state the dealer has sixty (60) days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the deficiency is cured within sixty (60) days, the notice shall be void. A supplier may not terminate a dealer agreement for the reason set forth in W.S. 40-20-115(a)(viii) unless the supplier gives the dealer notice of the action at least two (2) years before the effective date of the action. If the dealer achieves the supplier's requirements for reasonable standards or performance objectives before the expiration of the two (2) year notice period, the notice shall be void and the dealer agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The notice and right to cure provisions under this section shall not apply if the reason for termination is for any reason set forth in W.S. 40-20-115(a)(i) through (vii).</p>
                <p>(b) If a supplier has contractual authority to approve or deny a request for a sale or transfer of a dealer's business or an equity ownership interest, the supplier shall approve or deny the request within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request from the dealer. If the supplier has neither approved nor denied the request within the sixty (60) day period, the request shall be deemed approved. The dealer's request shall include reasonable financial, personal background, character references and work history information for the acquiring persons. If a supplier denies a request made pursuant to this subsection, the supplier shall provide the dealer with a written notice of the denial that states the reasons for the denial. A supplier may only deny a request based on the failure of the proposed transferee to meet the reasonable requirements consistently imposed by the supplier in determining approval of the transfer or approval of a new dealer.</p>
                <p>(c) If a dealer dies and the supplier has contractual authority to approve or deny a request for a sale or transfer of the dealer's business or his equity ownership interest, the dealer's estate or other person with authority to transfer assets of the dealer, shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to submit to the supplier a written request for a sale or transfer of the business or equity ownership interest. If the request is timely submitted, the supplier shall approve or deny the request in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, any attempt by the supplier to terminate the dealer or the dealership as a result of the death of a dealer shall be delayed until there has been compliance with the terms of this subsection or the one hundred eighty (180) day period has expired, as applicable.</p>
                <p>(d) If a supplier and dealer have executed an agreement concerning succession rights before the dealer's death and that agreement has not been revoked or otherwise terminated by either party, the agreement shall control the terms of succession even if it designates someone other than the surviving spouse or heirs of the decedent as the successor.</p>
                <p>(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the dealer agreements between a single line dealer and the single line supplier.</p>

                <p>(b) If a dealer dies, a supplier shall have ninety (90) days in which to consider and make a determination on a request by a family member to enter into a new dealer agreement to operate the dealership. If the supplier determines that the requesting family member is not acceptable, the supplier shall provide the family member with a written notice of its determination with the stated reasons for nonacceptance. This subsection does not entitle an heir, personal representative or family member to operate a dealership without the specific written consent of the supplier.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>40-20-119. Reimbursement for warranty work.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If a dealer submits a warranty claim to a supplier while the dealer agreement is in effect or within sixty (60) days after the termination of the dealer agreement and if the claim is for work performed before the termination or expiration of the dealer agreement, the supplier shall accept or reject the warranty claim by written notice to the dealer within thirty (30) days after the supplier's receipt of the claim. If the supplier does not reject the warranty claim in the time period specified above, the claim shall be deemed accepted. If the supplier accepts the warranty claim, the supplier shall pay or credit to the dealer's account all amounts owed with respect to the claim to the dealer within thirty (30) days after it is accepted. If the supplier rejects a warranty claim, the supplier shall give the dealer written or electronic notice of the grounds for rejection, which reasons shall be consistent with the supplier's reasons for rejecting warranty claims of other dealers, both in their terms and manner of enforcement.</p>
                <p>If no grounds for rejection are given, the claim shall be deemed accepted.</p>
                <p>(b) Any claim which is disapproved by the supplier based upon the dealer's failure to properly follow the procedural or technical requirements for submission of warranty claims may be resubmitted in proper form by the dealer within thirty (30) days of receipt by the dealer of the supplier's notification of the disapproval.</p>
                <p>(c) Warranty work performed by the dealer shall be compensated in accordance with the reasonable and customary amount of time required to complete the work, expressed in hours and fractions multiplied by the dealer's established customer hourly retail labor rate, which shall have previously been made known to the supplier. Parts used in warranty repair work shall be reimbursed at the current net price plus fifteen percent (15%).</p>
                <p>(d) For purposes of this chapter, any repair work or installation of replacement parts performed with respect to the dealer's equipment in inventory or equipment of the dealer's customers at the request of the supplier, including work performed pursuant to a product improvement program, shall be deemed to create a warranty claim for which the dealer shall be paid pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p>(e) A supplier may audit warranty claims submitted by its dealers for a period of up to one (1) year following payment of the claims, and may charge back to its dealers any amounts paid based upon claims shown by the audit to be misrepresented. If a warranty claim is misrepresented, then warranty claims submitted within the three (3) year period ending with the date a claim is shown by the audit to be misrepresented may be audited.</p>
                <p>(f) The requirements of subsections (a) through (c) of this section apply to all warranty claims submitted by a dealer to a supplier in which the dealer has complied with the supplier's reasonable policies and procedures for warranty reimbursement. A supplier's warranty reimbursement policies and procedures shall be deemed unreasonable to the extent they conflict with any of the provisions of this section.</p>
                <p>(g) A dealer may choose to accept alternate reimbursement terms and conditions in lieu of the requirements of subsections</p>
                <p>(a) through (c) of this section if there is a written dealer agreement between the supplier and the dealer that requires the supplier to compensate the dealer for warranty labor costs either as:</p>
                <p>(i) A discount in the pricing of the equipment to the dealer; or</p>
                <p>(ii) A lump sum payment to the dealer that is made to the dealer within ninety (90) days of the sale of the supplier's new equipment.</p>
                <p>(h) The discount or lump sum described in subsection (g) of this section shall be no less than five percent (5%) of the suggested retail price of the equipment. If the requirements of subsections (g) and (h) of this section are met and alternate terms and conditions are in place, subsections (a) through (c) of this section do not apply and the alternate terms and conditions are enforceable. Nothing contained in this subsection or subsection (g) of this section shall be deemed to effect the supplier's obligation to reimburse the dealer for parts in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) Whenever any dealer enters into a dealer agreement with a supplier and either the supplier or the dealer desires to cancel, not renew or otherwise discontinue the dealer agreement, the supplier shall pay to the dealer or credit to the dealer's account, if the dealer has outstanding any sums owing the supplier, unless the dealer should desire to keep the equipment or repair parts:</p>
                <p>(i) A sum equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the net equipment cost of all new, unsold, undamaged equipment, one hundred percent (100%) of the net equipment cost of all unsold, undamaged demonstrators, less a downward adjustment to reflect a reasonable allowance for depreciation due to usage of the demonstrators, which adjustment shall be based on published industry rental rates to the extent such rates are available and ninety-five percent (95%) of the current net parts prices on new, unsold, undamaged repair parts that had previously been purchased from the supplier and held by the dealer on the date the dealer agreement terminates or expires. Demonstrators with less than fifty (50) hours of use for machines with hour meters, shall be considered new, unsold or undamaged equipment subject to repurchase under this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(ii) A sum equal to five percent (5%) of the current net parts price of all repair parts returned to compensate the dealer for the handling, packing and loading of the repair parts for return to the supplier. The five percent (5%) shall not be paid or credited to the dealer if the supplier elects to perform the handling, packing and loading of the repair parts;</p>
                <p>(iii) The fair market value of any specific data processing hardware or software the supplier required the dealer to acquire or purchase to satisfy the requirements of the supplier, including computer equipment required and approved by the supplier to communicate with the supplier. Fair market value of property subject to repurchase pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be the acquisition cost, including any shipping, handling and setup fees, less straight line depreciation of the acquisition cost over three (3) years. If the dealer purchased data processing hardware or software that exceeded the supplier's minimum requirements, the acquisition cost of the data processing hardware or software shall be deemed to be the acquisition cost of hardware or software of similar quality that did not exceed the minimum requirements of the supplier;</p>
                <p>(iv) A supplier shall repurchase specialized repair tools at a price equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the total invoice amount charged by the supplier to the dealer.</p>
                <p>(b) Upon the payment or allowance of credit to the dealer's account of the sums required by this section, the title to all inventory purchased hereunder shall pass to the supplier making the payment and the supplier shall be entitled to the possession of the inventory. All payments or allowances of credit due dealers shall be paid or credited within ninety (90) days after receipt by the supplier of property required to be repurchased. Any payments or allowances of credit due dealers that are not paid within the ninety (90) day period shall accrue interest at the maximum rate allowed by law. The supplier may withhold payments due under this subsection during the period of time in which the dealer fails to comply with its contractual obligations to remove any signage indicating the dealer is an authorized dealer of the supplier.</p>
                <p>(c) If any supplier refuses to repurchase any inventory covered under the provisions of this chapter after cancellation, nonrenewal or discontinuance of the dealer agreement, the supplier shall be civilly liable to the dealer for one hundred ten percent (110%) of the amount that would have been due for the inventory if the supplier had timely complied with this chapter, any freight charges paid by the dealer, interest accrued and the dealer's actual costs of any court or arbitration proceeding, including costs for attorney fees and costs of arbitrators.</p>
                <p>(d) The supplier and dealer shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of the costs of freight, at truckload rates, to ship any equipment or repair parts returned to the supplier pursuant to this chapter.</p>
                <p>(e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the uniform commercial code adopted by this state, the dealer shall retain a first and prior lien against all inventory returned by the dealer to the supplier under the provisions of this chapter until the dealer is paid all amounts owed by the supplier for the repurchase of the inventory required under the provisions of this chapter. The dealer's lien under this subsection shall constitute a perfected security interest for a period of six (6) years without the filing of a financing statement.</p>
                <p>(f) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect in any way any security interest which the supplier may have in the inventory of the dealer, and any repurchase hereunder shall not be subject to the provisions of the bulk sales law or to the claims of any secured or unsecured creditors of the supplier or any assignee of the supplier until the time the dealer has received full payment or credit, as applicable.</p>

                <p>(i) Any repair part in a broken or damaged package. The supplier shall be required to repurchase a repair part in a broken or damaged package, for a repurchase price that is equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the current net price for the repair part, if the aggregate current net price for the entire package of repair parts is seventy-five dollars ($75.00) or higher;</p>

                <p>(a) If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver information in writing to another person, the requirement is satisfied if the information is provided, sent or delivered, as the case may be, in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt. An electronic record is not capable of retention by the recipient if the sender or its information processing system inhibits the ability of the recipient to print or store the electronic record.</p>
                <p>(b) If a law other than this act requires a record to be posted or displayed in a certain manner, to be sent, communicated or transmitted by a specified method or to contain information that is formatted in a certain manner, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) The record must be posted or displayed in the manner specified in the other law;</p>
                <p>(ii) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(ii) of this section, the record must be sent, communicated or transmitted by the method specified in the other law;</p>
                <p>(iii) The record must contain the information formatted in the manner specified in the other law.</p>
                <p>(c) If a sender inhibits the ability of a recipient to store or print an electronic record, the electronic record is not enforceable against the recipient.</p>
                <p>(d) The requirements of this section may not be varied by agreement, but:</p>
                <p>(i) To the extent a law other than this act requires information to be provided, sent or delivered in writing but permits that requirement to be varied by agreement, the requirement under subsection (a) of this section that the information be in the form of an electronic record capable of retention may also be varied by agreement; and</p>
                <p>(ii) A requirement under a law other than this act to send, communicate or transmit a record by first-class mail, postage prepaid or regular United States mail, may be varied by agreement to the extent permitted by the other law.</p>

                <p>(a) An electronic record or electronic signature is attributable to a person if it was the act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including a showing of the efficacy of any security procedure applied to determine the person to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.</p>
                <p>(b) The effect of an electronic record or electronic signature attributed to a person under subsection (a) of this section is determined from the context and surrounding circumstances at the time of its creation, execution or adoption, including the parties' agreement, if any, and otherwise as provided by law.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>40-21-110. Effect of change or error.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If a change or error in an electronic record occurs in a transmission between parties to a transaction, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes or errors and one (1) party has conformed to the procedure, but the other party has not, and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party also conformed, the conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or erroneous electronic record;</p>
                <p>(ii) In an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual:</p>
                <p>(A) Promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person;</p>
                <p>(B) Takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other person's reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the other person, to destroy the consideration received, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record; and</p>
                <p>(C) Has not used or received any benefit or value from the consideration, if any, received from the other person.</p>
                <p>(iii) If neither paragraph (i) nor (ii) of this subsection applies, the change or error has the effect provided by other law, including the law of mistake, and the parties' contract, if any;</p>
                <p>(iv) Paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subsection may not be varied by agreement.</p>

                <p>(a) If a law requires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record of the information in the record which:</p>
                <p>(i) Accurately reflects the information set forth in the record after it was first generated in its final form as an electronic record or otherwise; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Remains accessible for later reference.</p>
                <p>(b) A requirement to retain a record in accordance with subsection (a) of this section does not apply to any information the sole purpose of which is to enable the record to be sent, communicated or received.</p>
                <p>(c) A person may satisfy subsection (a) of this section by using the services of another person if the requirements of that subsection are satisfied.</p>
                <p>(d) If a law requires a record to be presented or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if the record is not presented or retained in its original form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(e) If a law requires retention of a check, that requirement is satisfied by retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the check in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(f) A record retained as an electronic record in accordance with subsection (a) of this section satisfies a law requiring a person to retain a record for evidentiary, audit or like purposes, unless a law enacted after the effective date of this act specifically prohibits the use of an electronic record for the specified purpose.</p>
                <p>(g) This section does not preclude a governmental agency of this state from specifying additional requirements for the retention of a record subject to the agency's jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>(a) In an automated transaction, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) A contract may be formed by the interaction of electronic agents of the parties, even if no individual was aware of or reviewed the electronic agents' actions or the resulting terms and agreements;</p>

                <p>(iii) The terms of the contract are determined by the substantive law applicable to it.</p>

                <p>(a) Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is sent when it:</p>
                <p>(i) Is addressed properly or otherwise directed properly to an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record;</p>
                <p>(ii) Is in a form capable of being processed by that system; and</p>

                <p>(b) Unless otherwise agreed between a sender and the recipient, an electronic record is received when:</p>
                <p>(i) It enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record; and</p>
                <p>(ii) It is in a form capable of being processed by that system.</p>
                <p>(c) Subsection (b) of this section applies even if the place the information processing system is located is different from the place the electronic record is deemed to be received under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) Unless otherwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from the sender's place of business and to be received at the recipient's place of business. For purposes of this subsection, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If the sender or recipient has more than one (1) place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest relationship to the underlying transaction;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the sender's or recipient's residence, as the case may be.</p>
                <p>(e) An electronic record is received under subsection (b) of this section even if no individual is aware of its receipt.</p>
                <p>(f) Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subsection (b) of this section establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.</p>
                <p>(g) If a person is aware that an electronic record purportedly sent under subsection (a) of this section, or purportedly received under subsection (b) of this section, was not actually sent or received, the legal effect of the sending or receipt is determined by other applicable law. Except to the extent permitted by the other law, the requirements of this subsection may not be varied by agreement.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>40-21-116. Transferable records.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) In this section, "transferable record" means an electronic record that:</p>
                <p>(i) Would be a note under article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code or a document under article 7 of the Uniform Commercial Code if the electronic record were in writing; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a transferable record.</p>
                <p>(b) A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.</p>
                <p>(c) A system satisfies subsection (b) of this section, and a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored and assigned in such a manner that:</p>
                <p>(i) A single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists which is unique, identifiable and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (iv), (v) and (vi) of this subsection, unalterable;</p>
                <p>(ii) The authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:</p>
                <p>(A) The person to which the transferable record was issued; or</p>
                <p>(B) If the authoritative copy indicates that the transferable record has been transferred, the person to which the transferable record was most recently transferred.</p>
                <p>(iii) The authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person asserting control or its designated custodian;</p>
                <p>(iv) Copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control;</p>
                <p>(v) Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and</p>
                <p>(vi) Any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.</p>
                <p>(d) Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of a transferable record is the holder, as defined in W.S. 34.1-1-201(a)(xx), of the transferable record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing under the Uniform Commercial Code, including, if the applicable statutory requirements under W.S. 34.1-3-302(a), 34.1-7-501 or 34.1-9-308 of the Uniform Commercial Code are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, respectively. Delivery, possession and indorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of the rights under this subsection.</p>
                <p>(e) Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a transferable record has the same rights and defenses as an equivalent obligor under equivalent records or writings under the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
                <p>(f) If requested by a person against which enforcement is sought, the person seeking to enforce the transferable record shall provide reasonable proof that the person is in control of the transferable record. Proof may include access to the authoritative copy of the transferable record and related business records sufficient to review the terms of the transferable record and to establish the identity of the person having control of the transferable record.</p>

                <p>(iv) Any other required attributes for electronic records which are specified for corresponding nonelectronic records or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 40-21-112(f), this act does not require a governmental agency of this state to use or permit the use of electronic records or electronic signatures.</p>

                <p>(a) Each application shall be accompanied by a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or other similar security device acceptable to the commissioner in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or two and one-half (2 \xBD) times the outstanding payment instruments, whichever is greater. The commissioner may increase the required amount of the bond or security device to a maximum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) upon the basis of the impaired financial condition of a licensee as evidenced by a reduction in net worth, financial losses or other relevant criteria. The security device shall be in a form satisfactory to the commissioner and shall run to the state for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission and payment of money in connection with the sale and issuance of payment instruments or transmission of money.

                <p>(i) The financial responsibility and experience, character and fitness of the license applicant, of the owners or persons in charge of the applicant and individuals designated in charge of the applicant's places of business, are such as to warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly and fairly within the purposes of this act;</p>

                <p>(g) No licensee shall change the location of any place of business, consolidate two (2) or more locations, open a new location or close any location, without giving the commissioner prior written notice and paying a license modification fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) as set by rule of the commissioner.</p>

                <p>(a) Within three (3) working days of taking a mortgage loan application and prior to receiving any consideration, other than third party fees, from the borrower, the mortgage lender shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Disclose the terms of the loan to the borrower in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, its associated regulations, and the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and its associated regulations and any other applicable federal and state requirements;</p>
                <p>(ii) If a prepayment penalty may be a condition of the residential mortgage loan offered to a borrower, that fact shall be separately disclosed in writing to the borrower and the borrower shall agree in writing to accept that condition. The disclosure shall state that a prepayment penalty provision imposes a charge if the borrower refinances or pays off the mortgage loan before the date for repayment stated in the loan agreement. The written disclosure shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall initially be delivered along with the good faith estimate of settlement costs within three (3) business days after accepting an application from the borrower. The disclosure shall subsequently be provided by the lender and signed by the borrower at the same time the borrower is given the final federal Truth-in-Lending Act disclosure.</p>
                <p>(b) With the exception of a loan cancellation fee, a licensed mortgage lender shall not require a borrower to pay any fees or charges prior to a residential mortgage loan closing, except:</p>
                <p>(i) Charges actually incurred by the licensee on behalf of the borrower for services which have been rendered by third parties necessary to process the application. These fees may include, but are not limited to, fees for credit reports, flood insurance certifications, property inspections, title insurance commitments, uniform commercial code article 4 lien searches, and appraisals;</p>
                <p>(ii) A rate lock in fee; and</p>
                <p>(iii) A commitment fee upon approval of the residential mortgage loan.</p>
                <p>(c) A loan cancellation fee may be charged and collected by a licensee at any time either prior to the scheduled closing of a residential mortgage loan transaction or subsequent thereto.</p>
                <p>(d) Any fees charged under the authority of this section shall be reasonable and customary as to the type and the amount of the fee charged.</p>
                <p>(e) A mortgage lender shall not receive any fee that inures to the benefit of the mortgage lender, either directly or indirectly, if the fee exceeds the fee disclosed on the most recent good faith estimate unless:</p>
                <p>(i) The need to charge the higher fee was not reasonably foreseeable at the time the good faith estimate was written; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The mortgage lender has provided to the borrower, no less than three (3) business days prior to the signing of the mortgage loan closing documents, a new good faith estimate of settlement costs, a clear written explanation of the increase in the fee and the reason for charging a fee that exceeds the fee which was previously disclosed.</p>
                <p>(f) If the fee was originally disclosed as a percentage of the mortgage loan amount and the dollar amount of the fee increases because the mortgage loan amount increases, but the fee as a percentage of the mortgage loan amount does not change, then no redisclosure shall be required unless the fee increased by more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).</p>

                <p>(a) The commissioner may suspend, not to exceed six (6) months, or revoke a license if the commissioner finds:</p>
                <p>(i) Any fact or condition exists that, if it had existed at the time when the licensee applied for its license, would have been grounds for denying the application;</p>
                <p>(ii) The licensee violated any provision of this act or any rule or order validly promulgated by the commissioner;</p>
                <p>(iii) The licensee is conducting its business in an unsafe or unsound manner;</p>
                <p>(iv) The licensee refuses to permit the commissioner to make any examination authorized by this act;</p>

                <p>(vi) The competence, experience, character or general fitness of the licensee indicates that it is not in the public interest to permit the licensee to continue to conduct business;</p>
                <p>(vii) The bond of the licensee has been revoked, cancelled, expired or otherwise is not effective;</p>
                <p>(viii) The licensee or any partner, officer, director, manager or employee of the licensee has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving any aspect of the mortgage lending business, breach of trust, or fraudulent or dishonest dealing;</p>

                <p>(x) The licensee has filed an application for a license which as of the date the license was issued, or as of the date of an order denying, suspending or revoking a license, was incomplete in any material respect or contained any statement that was, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, false or misleading with respect to any material fact.</p>
                <p>(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, if the commissioner finds that probable cause for revocation of a license exists and that enforcement of this act and the public interest require immediate suspension of the license pending investigation, he may, after a hearing upon five (5) days written notice, enter an order suspending the license for not more than thirty (30) days.</p>
                <p>(c) The commissioner may, in his discretion, reinstate a license, terminate a suspension or grant a new license to a person whose license has been revoked or suspended if no fact or condition then exists which clearly would justify the commissioner in refusing to grant a license.</p>

                <p>(a) Actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined. Upon application to the court an injunction shall be terminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist, but the injunction may be continued for an additional reasonable period of time in order to eliminate commercial advantage that otherwise would be derived from the misappropriation.</p>
                <p>(b) In exceptional circumstances, an injunction may condition future use upon payment of a reasonable royalty for no longer than the period of time for which use could have been prohibited. Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.</p>
                <p>(c) In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order.</p>

                <p>(a) Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.</p>
                <p>(b) If willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award exemplary damages in the amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) A person may not discriminate in the sale or rental of, or make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a disability of:</p>
                <p>(i) The buyer or renter;</p>
                <p>(ii) An individual residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented, or made available; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Any individual associated with the buyer or renter.</p>
                <p>(b) A person may not discriminate against an individual in the terms, conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with the dwelling because of a disability of:</p>
                <p>(i) That individual;</p>
                <p>(ii) An individual residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented, or made available; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Any individual associated with that individual.</p>
                <p>(c) In this section, discrimination includes:</p>
                <p>(i) A refusal to permit, at the expense of the individual having a disability, a reasonable modification of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by the individual if the modification may be necessary to afford the individual full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may condition, when it is reasonable to do so, permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted;</p>
                <p>(ii) A refusal to make a reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices or services if the accommodation may be necessary to afford the individual equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or</p>
                <p>(iii) The failure to design and construct a covered multifamily dwelling in a manner that allows the public use and common use portions of the dwellings to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals having a disability, that allows all doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within the dwellings to be sufficiently wide to allow passage by an individual who has a disability and who is in a wheelchair, and that provides all premises within the dwellings contain the following features of adaptive design:</p>
                <p>(A) An accessible route into and throughout the dwelling;</p>
                <p>(B) Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations;</p>
                <p>(C) Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and</p>
                <p>(D) Kitchens and bathrooms that are usable and have sufficient space in which an individual in a wheelchair can maneuver.</p>
                <p>(d) Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American national standard for buildings and facilities providing accessibility and usability for individuals having physical disabilities, as that standard exists on July 1, 2015, satisfies the requirements of adaptive design in paragraph (c)(iii) of this section.</p>
                <p>(e) The adaptive design requirements of subparagraph (c)(iii)(A) of this section do not apply to a building the first occupancy of which occurred on or before March 13, 1991.</p>
                <p>(f) This section does not require a dwelling to be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.</p>
                <p>(g) Covered multifamily dwellings are buildings consisting of four (4) or more units if the buildings have one (1) or more elevators and ground floor units in other buildings consisting of four (4) or more units.</p>

                <p>(a) The provisions of this chapter relating to familial status and age do not apply to housing that the secretary of housing and urban development determines is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly individuals under a federal program; the enforcing authority determines is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly individuals under a state program; is intended for, and solely occupied by, individuals sixty-two (62) years of age or older; or is intended and operated for occupancy by at least one (1) individual fifty-five (55) years of age or older for each unit as determined by enforcing authority rules. In determining whether housing qualifies as housing for elderly because it is intended and operated for occupancy by at least one (1) individual fifty-five (55) years of age or older for each unit, the enforcing authority shall adopt rules that require at least the following factors:</p>
                <p>(i) That at least eighty percent (80%) of the units are occupied by at least one (1) individual fifty-five (55) years of age or older per unit; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for individuals fifty-five (55) years of age or older.</p>
                <p>(b) Housing may not be considered to be in violation of the requirements for housing for elderly under this section by reason of:</p>
                <p>(i) Individuals residing in the housing as of July 1, 2015, who do not meet the age requirements of this section, provided that new occupants of the housing meet the age requirements; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Unoccupied units, provided that the units are reserved for occupancy by individuals who meet the age requirements of this section.</p>

                <p>(vii) Any other factor that the commissioner or secretary determines to be relevant.</p>
                <p>(g) If an application is authorized under subsection (f) of this section, the commissioner or secretary shall specify the statutory or rule requirements, or portions thereof, for which a waiver is granted and the length of the initial sandbox period, consistent with W.S. 40-29-102(a)(vii).
