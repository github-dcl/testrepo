                  <p>(a) The inspector shall under W.S. 16-3-101 through 16-3-115 promulgate rules and regulations to implement this act. Rules and regulations shall be promulgated under this act for all types of mines and mining or for specific types of mines or mining as required to implement this act and to comply with applicable federal law. The rules and regulations shall be no more stringent than federal rules and regulations and shall provide the flexibility necessary in application to specific instances and implement the basic purpose of giving all mining operations and coal mines the greatest freedom consistent with the public interest and the safety of employees and the general public. The inspector shall adopt applicable rules and regulations to the extent necessary to implement the provisions of chapter 3 of this title for which there are no applicable federal rules and regulations. The inspector shall submit all rules and regulations to the council for final approval. The rules implementing the provisions of chapter 3 of this title shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent not in conflict with an express provision of chapter 3 of this title, provide for consistency and equivalency but not more stringent than rules and regulations adopted by the MSHA under Title 30 of the code of Federal Regulations, Parts 56, 57, 75 and 77, as may be amended, including provisions incorporated by reference in those rules and regulations; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Authorize variances to safety rules upon petition by the affected operator and a determination by the inspector that:</p>
                  <p>(A) An alternative method of achieving the result of the standard exists that will at all times guarantee no less than the same measure of protection afforded by the standard;</p>
                  <p>(B) Application of the standard will result in a diminution to safety of the miners; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Failure to grant the variance would be inconsistent with action taken on the same petition by the MSHA.</p>
                  <p>(b) The inspector of mines shall by rule or regulation:</p>
                  <p>(i) Adopt and enforce a uniform code of signals;</p>

The condition or method shall be corrected in five (5) days or other time prescribed by the inspector or his deputy as is reasonable in view of the nature of the condition or method. Allowing a correction period does not prevent the condition or method constituting a violation of this act or a rule or regulation adopted under it.

The matter shall be given precedence on the calendar of the court and the proceedings shall be by petition and order to show cause, returnable within ten (10) days. If any action by the inspector or his deputy is found to have been without justification and to have been taken without reasonable basis, the inspector or his deputy shall be liable on his bond for damages resulting therefrom, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the operator in the action.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>30-2-309. Mine foreman and mine examiner certificates; qualifications; certificate required; reciprocity; council duties.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) No person shall act as mine foreman or safety engineer at any underground mine unless he holds a mine foreman certificate for the type of mineral being mined. To obtain a mine foreman certificate for a particular mineral an applicant shall pass the required examination for the particular mineral. An applicant for the mine foreman examination shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Be at least twenty-three (23) years of age;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except as otherwise provided, provide verifiable documentation that he has at least three (3) years practical experience in the mining of the mineral in which he desires to hold a mine foreman certificate. Practical experience shall be determined from practical work of a "hands-on" nature, directly related to the hazards involved in the type of mine for which the certificate is sought. Underground coal mine experience shall qualify for gassy metal or nonmetal mine experience. The council may grant one (1) year's experience credit for not less than five (5) years' experience in an underground gassy metal or nonmetal mine for underground coal mine experience. Surface mine experience in a different mineral may be considered by the council when qualifying an applicant to take the examination for surface foreman certification. The council may grant one (1) year experience credit for not less than ten (10) years experience in another type of mine or in an industry similar in nature to mining;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Complete and timely file an examination application;</p>
                  <p>(iv) When the applicant seeks to receive practical experience credit for holding a mining engineering degree, provide verifiable documentation of the degree; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Hold a valid mine examiner's certificate.</p>
                  <p>(b) No person shall act as a mine examiner in any underground mine unless he holds a mine examiner certificate for the type of mineral being mined. To obtain a mine examiner certificate for a particular mineral an applicant shall pass the required examination for the particular mineral. An applicant for the mine examiner examination shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide verifiable documentation that he has at least two (2) years practical experience in the type of mineral mined in which he desires to hold a mine examiner certificate. Practical experience shall be determined from practical work of a "hands-on" nature, directly related to the hazards involved in the type of mine for which the certificate is sought. Underground coal mine experience shall qualify for gassy metal or nonmetal mine experience. Gassy metal or nonmetal mine experience shall not qualify for underground coal mine experience;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Complete and timely file an examination application;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Be at least twenty-three (23) years of age; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) When the applicant seeks to receive practical experience credit for holding an engineering degree, provide verifiable documentation of the degree.</p>
                  <p>(c) A mining engineering degree from an accredited college or university shall be considered the equivalent of one (1) year practical experience for mine foreman certificate and one (1) year for mine examiner certificate. An approved degree from an accredited college or university which degree is related to mining may be considered the equivalent of one (1) year practical experience for mine foreman certificate and one (1) year for mine examiner certificate. In no case shall practical experience credit for a degree, mining experience credit or a combination thereof exceed one (1) year for a mine foreman certificate or one (1) year for a mine examiner certificate.</p>
                  <p>For purposes of this section a degree shall be limited to a baccalaureate, master's or doctorate degree.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any person holding a certificate of competency from a proper examining board of any state with which Wyoming has a reciprocal agreement may perform the duties in Wyoming for which his certificate certifies that he is competent, without examination by the state mining council. Before assuming any duties in a mine, the person shall present his certificate to the council through the inspector and secure approval of the certificate by the council. The person is subject to examination by the council at the request of the inspector. The person's authority to act in Wyoming as mine foreman, mine examiner or safety engineer may be cancelled in the same manner as certificates issued by the council. No person shall employ any mine foreman, mine examiner or safety engineer in an underground mine who does not possess the certificate of competency required.</p>
                  <p>(e) The state mining council shall include in its rules for implementation of this article, the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Procedures for review and approval of a study manual prepared by industry to provide guidance to those taking the examinations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Procedures for preparing the examinations by the council or a committee of council members appointed for this purpose, provided that final approval of the examination shall be made by the council;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Procedures for grading examinations;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Procedures for reviewing the examination results by an applicant with a designated committee of the council and provisions for appeal by an applicant of any adverse decision of the council;</p>
                  <p>(v) Each examination shall include questions to ascertain the applicant's general knowledge of mining practices in the type of mine and mineral involved, including but not limited to ventilation, health and safety, rescue and recovery work involved following mine disasters, detection and control of gasses, fire and explosion prevention and control, use of blasting procedures, electricity and mine equipment and knowledge of the applicable state mining laws. The examination shall also properly identify the importance of any single question which if not answered correctly would cause failure of the entire examination;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Criteria for granting experience credit for purposes of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any certificate issued by the council or temporary permit issued by the inspector may be suspended or revoked by the council for violation of this act or rules and regulations promulgated under this act, intoxication while in duty status, mental disabilities or neglect of duty. Except as otherwise provided, the council may revoke or suspend a certificate or temporary permit only after a hearing in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The council may suspend any certificate or temporary permit pending further investigation and hearing, for actions that pose a serious threat to the health and safety of miners. The council shall establish by rule a time limit after the alleged date of an incident as provided in this subsection within which a complaint shall be filed. All complaints shall be verified and filed in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the council. The council or designated members of the council may, after reviewing the complaint and conducting any investigation deemed necessary, determine that the grounds alleged do not warrant suspension or revocation and dismiss the complaint without hearing. No person whose certificate has been revoked under this section for less than ninety (90) days shall be examined by the council. No person whose certificate has been revoked under this section shall be reissued a certificate unless the council finds the incapacity, if any, on which the revocation was based has ceased to exist.</p>

                  <p>(e) At least once each week, the mine foreman or other certified persons designated by him, shall measure the volume of air near the main intake or main return, the amount passing through the last open crosscut of entries, and the volume of air in each split. A record of these measurements shall be kept in a book on the surface and shall be open for inspection by interested persons.</p>
                  <p>(f) The main-intake and main-return air currents in mines shall be in separate openings.</p>
                  <p>(g) All slopes or entries in coal mines shall be driven in sets of two (2) or more.</p>
                  <p>(h) In gassy mines haulage roads shall be in intake air.</p>
                  <p>(j) Battery-charging stations and transformer stations containing liquid-filled transformers shall be well ventilated by separate splits of air conducted through vents to the return air courses and returning direct to the surface.</p>
                  <p>(k) Changes in ventilation that materially affect the main air current or any split thereof shall be made when the mine is idle and with no men in the mine, other than those engaged in changing the ventilation.</p>
                  <p>(m) In gassy mines air that has passed through abandoned sections or that has been used to ventilate pillar lines shall not be reused to ventilate live workings.</p>
                  <p>(n) The inspector shall establish by rule ventilation requirements for mines and associated surface facilities. The rules may be generally applicable to all mines or promulgated for specific types of mines or mining operation and may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Establish minimum and maximum volumes of air required for specified areas of mines;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Specify the means for ventilation, including the use, installation and operation of main mine fans, booster fans, blower fans, exhausting and other fans, and associated equipment including warning and monitoring devices;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Specify the use, placement and construction of crosscuts, doors and line brattice needed to provide ventilation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Specify personal protective devices to be used to alleviate the effects of dust and harmful gases;</p>
                  <p>(v) Specify areas of the mine and times for monitoring, and training requirements for persons monitoring ventilation and associated equipment or providing ventilation in accordance with this act or rules adopted under this act;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Establish appropriate procedures for making changes in ventilation;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Specify required actions in response to hazards due to inadequate ventilation, including the existence of specified levels of dust or gases; and</p>
                  <p>(viii) Require recordkeeping in accordance with applicable federal law.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>30-4-104. Interstate Mining Compact.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>The Interstate Mining Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
                <p>Article I Findings and Purposes</p>
                <p>(a) The party states find that:</p>
                <p>(i) Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every state are of basic significance;</p>
                <p>(ii) The effects of mining on the availability of land, water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public;</p>
                <p>(iii) Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern;</p>
                <p>(iv) Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources; but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on lands, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated;</p>
                <p>(v) The states are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.</p>
                <p>(b) The purposes of this compact are to:</p>
                <p>(i) Advance the protection and restoration of land, water and other resources affected by mining;</p>
                <p>(ii) Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to mining;</p>
                <p>(iii) Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated;</p>
                <p>(iv) Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources;</p>
                <p>(v) Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.</p>
                <p>Article II Definitions</p>
                <p>(a) As used in this compact, the term:</p>
                <p>(i) "Mining" means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter, any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location, and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use; but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and shall not include excavation of grading when conducted solely in aid of on-site farming or construction;</p>
                <p>(ii) "State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States.</p>
                <p>Article III State Programs</p>
                <p>(a) Each party state agrees that within a reasonable time it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards, enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to accomplish:</p>
                <p>(i) The protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations;</p>
                <p>(ii) The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of land and water;</p>
                <p>(iii) The institution and maintenance of suitable programs of adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands;</p>
                <p>(iv) The prevention, abatement and control of water, air and soil pollution resulting from mining-present, past and future.</p>
                <p>Article IV Powers</p>
                <p>(a) In addition to any other powers conferred upon the interstate mining commission, established by article V of this compact, such commission shall have power to:</p>
                <p>(i) Study mining operations, processes and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation and patterns of community or regional development or change;</p>
                <p>(ii) Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining;</p>
                <p>(iii) Make recommendations concerning any aspect or aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact;</p>
                <p>(iv) Gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact;</p>
                <p>(v) Cooperate with the federal government and any public or private entities having interests in any subject coming within the purview of this compact;</p>
                <p>(vi) Consult, upon the request of a party state and within available resources, with the officials of such state in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact;</p>
                <p>(vii) Study and make recommendations with respect to any practice, process, technique, or course of action that may improve the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operations;</p>
                <p>(viii) Study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites.</p>
                <p>Article V The Commission</p>
                <p>(a) There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the "interstate mining commission", hereinafter called "the commission". The commission shall be composed of one (1) commissioner from each party state who shall be the governor thereof. Pursuant to the laws of the party state, each governor may have the assistance of an advisory body (including membership from mining industries, conservation interests, and such other and private interests as may be appropriate) in considering problems relating to mining and in discharging the responsibilities as a commissioner on the commission. In any instance where a governor is unable to attend a meeting of the commission or perform any other function in connection with the business of the commission, the governor shall designate an alternate who shall represent the state and act in the governor's place and stead. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the governor to the commission in such manner as its bylaws may provide.</p>
                <p>(b) The commissioners shall be entitled to one (1) vote each on the commission. No action of the commission making a recommendation pursuant to article IV(a)(iii), IV(a)(vii), and IV(a)(viii) or requesting, accepting or disposing of funds, services or other property pursuant to this subsection, article V(g), (V)(h), or VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission is cast in favor thereof. All other action shall be by a majority of those present and voting provided that action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners, or their alternates, are present. The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transaction of its business. The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.</p>
                <p>(c) The commission shall have a seal.</p>
                <p>(d) The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman and a treasurer. The commission shall appoint an executive director and fix duties and compensation of the executive director. Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission. The executive director, the treasurer, and such other personnel as the commission shall designate shall be bonded. The amount or amounts of such bond or bonds shall be determined by the commission.</p>
                <p>(e) Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director, with the approval of the commission, shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the commission's functions, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel.</p>
                <p>(f) The commission may establish and maintain independently or in conjunction with a party state, a suitable retirement system for its employees. Employees of the commission shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivor's insurance provided that the commission takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to the laws of the United States, to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The commission may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as it may deem appropriate.</p>
                <p>(g) The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association or corporation.</p>
                <p>(h) The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this subsection or services borrowed pursuant to subsection (g) of the article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission. Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant or services borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender.</p>
                <p>(j) The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws. The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states. (k) The commission annually shall make to the governor, legislature and advisory body of each party state described in subsection (a) of this article a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been made by the commission. The commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.</p>
                <p>Article VI</p>
                <p>Advisory, Technical, and Regional Committees</p>
                <p>The commission shall establish such advisory, technical, and regional committees as it may deem necessary, membership on which shall include private persons and public officials, and shall cooperate with the use and services of any such committees and the organizations which the members represent in furthering any of its activities. Such committees may be formed to consider problems of special interest to any party state, problems dealing with particular commodities or types of mining operations, problems related to reclamation, development, or use of mined land or any other matters of concern to the commission.</p>
                <p>Article VII Finance</p>
                <p>(a) The commission shall submit to the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p>
                <p>(b) Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-half (1/2) in equal shares, and the remainder in proportion to the value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined. In determining such values, the commission shall employ such available public source or sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of minerals, ores and other solid matter mined.</p>
                <p>(c) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under article V(h) of this compact; provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it under article V(h) hereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.</p>
                <p>(d) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the commission.</p>
                <p>(e) The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission.</p>
                <p>(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission.</p>
                <p>Article VIII</p>
                <p>Entry Into Force and Withdrawal</p>
                <p>(a) This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any four (4) or more states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.</p>
                <p>(b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability previously and separately agreed to, and already incurred by or chargeable to a party state, under article VII(b), prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p>
                <p>Article IX Effect On Other Laws Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit, repeal or supersede any other law of any party state.</p>
                <p>Article X Construction and Severability This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p>(vii) To use funds collected under W.S. 30-5-116(b) to plug wells and seismic holes and reclaim the surrounding area affected by them, if the commission is unable to enforce its regulations and laws requiring the owner, seismic contractor or hole plugger to plug and reclaim and if the owner, seismic contractor or hole plugger does not have an adequate surety bond or other guaranty to cover the cost of plugging and reclamation. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create any liability by the state for failure to adequately plug or reclaim wells or holes. If oil field equipment appears to have been abandoned in the area of a well or hole which is plugged or reclaimed under this paragraph, the commission may, after notice and a hearing as provided in W.S. 30-5-105 and 30-5-106 and a finding that the equipment is abandoned, dispose of the equipment. The commission may dispose of the equipment by public sale or by transferring it to the contractor who performs the plugging and reclamation for the commission. The transfer or proceeds of the sale shall be used to defray the cost of plugging or reclamation. The commission shall promulgate rules to implement this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(viii) To issue orders allowing the unitization of pore space associated with geologic sequestration sites pursuant to W.S. 35-11-314 through 35-11-317 and adopt such rules and regulations as necessary to effectuate the purposes of W.S. 35-11-314;</p>
                  <p>(ix) To issue orders pursuant to W.S. 30-5-110 allowing the unitization of oil and gas interests with consenting coal interests that are actually consumed as a direct result of well and reservoir injections to restore or enhance the microbial conversion of hydrocarbon substrates to methane gas.</p>

                  <p>In addition to the powers and authority, either express or implied, granted to the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission by virtue of the statutes of the state of Wyoming, the commission is hereby authorized and empowered in prescribing its rules of order or procedure in connection with hearings or other proceedings before the commission to provide for the appointment of one (1) or more examiners to conduct a hearing or hearings with respect to any matter properly coming before the commission and to make reports and recommendations to the commission with respect thereto. Any member of the commission, or its staff or any other person designated by the commission may serve as an examiner. The commission may also provide for additional compensation to be paid to a member of the commission appointed from the public at large or any other person designated by the commission for services performed as an examiner at the same rate as the at-large members of the commission are presently compensated. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations with regard to hearings to be conducted before examiners which shall provide for rehearing before the commission, upon the request of any interested party, of any matter heard before an examiner. The commission may enter orders based upon the reports and recommendations of its examiners. If such an order grants the request of an applicant, and no objection to the granting thereof has been filed or made before or during the hearing before the examiner, said order shall become effective immediately. If such an order denies the request of the applicant, in whole or in part, or if a timely protest to the granting of an application is filed or made, said order shall not become effective until: (a) the time prescribed by rule for the making of a request for rehearing before the commission has expired without any such request having been made or (b) all interested parties have waived their right to request a rehearing, or (c) if timely request for rehearing is made, the commission after rehearing, shall affirm, revoke or modify such order. After an order based upon a hearing conducted by an examiner has become effective, it shall have the same force and effect as if said hearing had been conducted before the members of said commission.</p>

                  <p>To enable the commission to carry out its duties and powers under the laws of this state with respect to conservation of oil and gas, and to enforce the rules and regulations so prescribed, the commission shall appoint one (1) chief administrator who shall be a qualified petroleum engineer or petroleum geologist with at least ten (10) years of experience in his respective field of expertise who shall be designated and known as the "State Oil and Gas Supervisor." Such supervisor shall hold office at the pleasure of the commission and shall receive a salary, to be fixed by the commission. The state oil and gas supervisor shall be charged with such duties as are delegated by the commission, and in addition thereto he shall investigate charges and complaints of violation of the laws of this state with respect to conservation of oil and gas, and any order, rules and regulation of the commission made in connection therewith, and report concerning all such violations to the commission. The commission may at any time, when it finds that the public interest will be served thereby appoint such other employees as are found to be necessary, to assist the commission and the state oil and gas supervisor in the discharge of their respective duties. All employees or assistants authorized by this act shall be paid their necessary traveling and living expenses when traveling on official business, at such rates and within such limits as may be fixed by the commission, subject to existing law.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>30-5-109. Rules and regulations governing drilling units.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) When required, to protect correlative rights or, to prevent or to assist in preventing any of the various types of waste of oil or gas prohibited by this act, or by any statute of this state, the commission, upon its own motion or on a proper application of an interested party, but after notice and hearing as herein provided shall have the power to establish drilling units of specified and approximately uniform size covering any pool.</p>
                  <p>(b) In establishing a drilling unit, the acreage to be embraced within each unit and the shape thereof shall be determined by the commission from the evidence introduced at the hearing but shall not be smaller than the maximum area that can be efficiently drained by one (1) well.</p>
                  <p>(c)(i) Subject to the provisions of this act, the order establishing drilling units for a pool or part thereof shall direct that no more than one (1) well shall be drilled to and produced from such pool on any unit, and that the well shall be drilled at a location authorized by the order, with such exception as may be reasonably necessary where the drilling unit is located on the edge of the pool and adjacent to a producing unit, or, for some other reason, the requirement to drill the well at the authorized location on the unit would be inequitable or unreasonable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The state oil and gas supervisor, upon proper application therefor in accordance with the commission's rules, may grant exceptions from such authorized location for good cause shown, either (A) where written consents to the exception applied for have been given by all owners of drilling units directly or diagonally offsetting the unit for which the exception is requested and, as to lands for which drilling units have not been so established for such pool, by the owners of those lands which would comprise the directly and diagonally offsetting drilling units if the drilling unit order for the pool involved were extended to include such additional lands, in which case said supervisor may grant such exception immediately, or (B) if less than all of such owners have so consented to such exception, where the applicant shows to the satisfaction of said supervisor (by affidavit stating the time, place and manner of mailing, or such further proof as said supervisor may require) that notice of the filing of such application for exception has been mailed by registered or certified mail with return receipt to all of such owners failing to so consent and that fifteen (15) days have elapsed since the date of such mailing without any of such owners having filed with said supervisor written objections to the granting of such exception, in which case the exception may be granted upon the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any of the owners specified in paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection, who have not in writing consented to the exception applied for, file written objections to the requested exception with the state oil and gas supervisor during said fifteen (15) day period following the applicant's mailing of the notice of filing, or if for any other reason said supervisor fails to grant such requested exception, then no well shall be drilled on the drilling unit involved except at the location authorized by the order establishing such unit, unless and until the commission shall grant such exception after notice and hearing upon the application as required by this act. Provided that in addition to any other notice required by W.S. 30-5-111(d) as amended, or any other provision of law or the commission's rules, the commission shall cause notice of any hearing before it on an application for such exception to be mailed by registered or certified mail with return receipt to each of the owners specified in paragraph (ii) of this subsection at least ten (10) days before the date of such hearing.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission, upon application, notice, and hearing, may decrease the size of the drilling units or permit additional wells to be drilled within the established units in order to prevent or assist in preventing any of the various types of waste prohibited by this act or in order to protect correlative rights, and the commission may enlarge the area covered by the order fixing drilling units, if the commission determines that the common source of supply underlies an area not covered by the order.</p>
                  <p>(e) After an order fixing drilling units has been entered by the commission, the commencement of drilling of any well or wells into any common source of supply for the purpose of producing oil or gas therefrom, at a location other than authorized by the order, is hereby prohibited. The operation of any well drilled in violation of an order fixing drilling units is prohibited.</p>
                  <p>(f) When two (2) or more separately owned tracts are embraced within a drilling unit, or when there are separately owned interests in all or a part of the drilling unit, then persons owning such interests may pool their interests for the development and operation of the drilling unit. In the absence of voluntary pooling, the commission, upon the application of any interested person, may enter an order pooling all interests in the drilling unit for the development and operation thereof. Each such pooling order shall be made after notice and hearing and shall be upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable. Operations incident to the drilling of a well upon any portion of a unit covered by a pooling order shall be deemed for all purposes to be the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit by the several owners thereof. That portion of the production allocated or applicable to each tract included in a unit covered by a pooling order shall, when produced, be deemed for all purposes to have been produced from such tract by a well drilled thereon. A pooling order issued under this subsection shall expire twelve (12) months after issuance if the person authorized to drill and operate a well fails to commence operations within twelve (12) months of issuance of the pooling order.</p>
                  <p>(g) Each pooling order shall provide for the drilling and operation of a well on the drilling unit, and for the payment of the cost thereof, as provided in this subsection. The commission is specifically authorized to provide that the owner or owners drilling or paying for the drilling or for the operation of a well for the benefit of all owners shall be entitled to all production from the well which would be received by the owner or owners, for whose benefit the well was drilled or operated, after payment of royalty as provided in the lease, if any, applicable to each tract or interest or after payment of the royalty if required under subsection (h) of this section, and obligations payable out of production, until the owner or owners drilling or operating the well or both have been paid the amount due under the terms of the pooling order or order settling the dispute. In the event of any disputed cost, the commission shall determine the proper cost. The order shall determine the interest of each owner in the unit, and may provide that each owner who agrees with the person or persons drilling and operating the well for the payment by the owner of his share of the costs, unless he has agreed otherwise, shall be entitled to receive, subject to royalty or similar obligations, the share of the production of the well applicable to the tract of the nonconsenting owner. Each owner who does not agree, shall be entitled to receive from the person or persons drilling and operating the well on the unit his share of the production applicable to his interest after the person or persons drilling and operating the well have recovered the following, subject to the provisions of subsection (h) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) One hundred percent (100%) of each such nonconsenting owner's share of the cost of any newly acquired surface equipment beyond the wellhead connections (including, but not limited to, stock tanks, separators, treaters, pumping equipment and piping), plus one hundred percent (100%) of each such nonconsenting owner's share of the cost of operation of the well commencing with first production and continuing until each such nonconsenting owner's relinquished interest shall revert to it under other provisions in this section, it being intended that each nonconsenting owner's share of such costs and equipment will be that interest which would have been chargeable to each nonconsenting owner had it initially agreed to pay its share of the costs of said well from the beginning of the operation; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Up to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Three hundred percent (300%) of that portion of the costs and expenses of drilling, reworking, deepening or plugging back, testing and completing, after deducting any cash contributions received and up to two hundred percent (200%) of that portion of the cost of newly acquired equipment in the well, to and including the wellhead connections, which would have been chargeable to the nonconsenting owner if he had participated therein, if the nonconsenting owner's tract or interest is subject to a lease or other contract for oil and gas development;</p>
                  <p>(B) For the first well the person drills and operates in a drilling unit and under a pooling order, two hundred percent (200%) of that portion of the costs and expenses of drilling, reworking, deepening or plugging back, testing and completing, after deducting any cash contributions received and up to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of that portion of the cost of newly acquired equipment in the well, to and including the wellhead connections, which would have been chargeable to the nonconsenting owner if he had participated therein, if the nonconsenting owner's tract or interest is not subject to a lease or other contract for oil and gas development;</p>
                  <p>(C) For each subsequent well the person drills and operates in a drilling unit and under a pooling order, one hundred fifty percent (150%) of that portion of the costs and expenses of drilling, reworking, deepening or plugging back, testing and completing, after deducting any cash contributions received and up to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of that portion of the cost of newly acquired equipment in the well, to and including the wellhead connections, which would have been chargeable to the nonconsenting owner if he had participated therein, if the nonconsenting owner's tract or interest is not subject to a lease or other contract for oil and gas development.</p>
                  <p>(h) During the time the person or persons drilling and operating a well are recovering costs from a nonconsenting owner as authorized in a pooling order issued pursuant to subsection</p>
                  <p>(g) of this section, a nonconsenting owner of a tract or interest in a drilling unit that is not subject to a lease or other contract for oil and gas development shall be entitled to a cost-free royalty interest equal to the greater of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Sixteen percent (16%); or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The acreage weighted average royalty interest of the leased tracts within the drilling unit.</p>
                  <p>(j) Upon full payment of the recoverable costs as specified in subsection (g) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) Within thirty (30) days after the producer has fully recovered his costs under subsection (g) of this section, the producer shall send notice to the nonconsenting owner to offer the nonconsenting owner the opportunity to participate under the pooling order as a working interest owner. The notice shall state that the nonconsenting owner may elect to participate in the pooling order or may elect to continue receiving the royalty specified in subsection (h) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Within sixty (60) days after receiving notice, the nonconsenting owner shall inform the producer whether he wishes to make an election to participate under the pooling order as a working interest owner or continue receiving the royalty specified in subsection (h) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the nonconsenting owner fails to respond to the notice within the time specified in paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the nonconsenting owner shall be deemed to elect to continue receiving the royalty specified in subsection (h) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Within five (5) business days after receiving notice of election from a nonconsenting owner or upon expiration of the time specified in paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the producer shall notify the commission regarding the nonconsenting owner's election or lack thereof.</p>

Agreements for waterflooding or other recovery operations, repressuring or pressure-maintenance operations, cycling or recycling operations; operation as a unit of 1 or more pools or parts thereof and pooling of interests in oil and gas therein; amendment of orders and agreements.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An agreement for waterflooding or other recovery operations involving the introduction of extraneous forms of energy into any pool, repressuring or pressure-maintenance operations, cycling or recycling operations, including the extraction and separation of liquid hydrocarbons from natural gas in connection therewith, or for carrying any other method of unit or cooperative development or operation of one (1) or more pools or parts thereof, is authorized and may be performed, and shall not be held or construed to violate any of the statutes of this state relating to trusts, monopolies, or contracts and combinations in restraint of trade, and may be submitted to the commission for approval as being in the public interest or reasonably necessary to prevent waste or to protect correlative rights. Approval of such agreement by the commission shall constitute a complete defense to any suit charging violation of any statute of this state relating to trusts, monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade on account of such agreement or on account of operations conducted pursuant thereto. The failure to submit such an agreement to the commission for approval shall not for that reason imply or constitute evidence that such agreement or operations conducted pursuant thereto are in violation of laws relating to trusts, monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except when context otherwise requires, the terms used or defined in W.S. 30-5-101, shall have the same meaning when used in this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any interested person may file an application with the commission requesting an order providing for the operation as a unit of one (1) or more pools or parts thereof and for the pooling of the interests in the oil and gas in the proposed unit area for the purpose of conducting such unit operation. Such application shall contain:</p>
                  <p>(i) A description of the land and pool, pools or portions thereof proposed to be so operated, termed the "unit area";</p>
                  <p>(ii) The names, as disclosed by the conveyance records of the county or counties in which the proposed unit area is situated, and the status records of the district office of the bureau of land management, of (A) all persons owning or having an interest in the oil and gas in such unit area or the production therefrom including mortgages and the owners of other liens or encumbrances, (B) all owners of every tract of land not included within but which immediately adjoins the proposed unit area or a corner thereof, and (C) the addresses of all such persons and owners, if known. If the name or address of any such person or owner is unknown, the application shall so indicate;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A statement of the type of operations contemplated in order to effectuate the purposes of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A proposed plan of unitization applicable to the proposed unit area which the applicant considers fair, reasonable and equitable and which shall include provisions for the formula or method of allocating oil and gas produced from the proposed unit area to and among the separately owned tracts within such area, the appointment of a unit operator and the time when the plan is to become effective;</p>
                  <p>(v) A proposed operating plan providing the manner in which the unit will be supervised and managed and costs allocated and paid, unless all owners within the proposed unit area have joined in executing an operating agreement or plan providing for such supervision, management and allocation and payment of costs.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon filing of such application, the commission shall promptly set the matter for hearing, and in addition to the notice, if any otherwise required by law or the commission's rules, shall cause notice of such hearing, specifying the time and place of hearing, and describing briefly its purpose and the land affected, to be mailed by certified mail at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing to all persons whose names and addresses are required to be listed in the application.</p>
                  <p>(e) If after considering the application and hearing the evidence offered in connection therewith, the commission shall enter an order setting forth the following described findings and approving the proposed plan of unitization and proposed operating plan, if any, if the commission finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The material allegations of the application are substantially true;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Such unit operation is feasible, will prevent waste, will protect correlative rights, and can reasonably be expected to increase substantially the ultimate recovery of oil or gas;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The value of the estimated additional recovery of oil or gas will exceed the estimated additional costs incident to conducting unit operations;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The oil and gas allocated to each separately owned tract within the unit area under the proposed plan of unitization represents, so far as can be practically determined, each such tract's just and equitable share of the oil or gas in the unit area;</p>
                  <p>(v) Where the unit embraces less than the whole of a pool, that the portion thereof to be included within the unit area is of such size and shape as may be reasonably required for the successful and efficient conduct of the unitized method or methods of operation for which the unit is created and that the conduct thereof will have no material adverse effect upon the remainder of such pool;</p>
                  <p>(vi) In case there are owners who have not executed an operating agreement or agreed to the proposed operating plan covering the supervision, management and allocation of payment costs, that such proposed operating plan:</p>
                  <p>(A) Makes a fair and equitable adjustment among the owners within the unit area for their respective investments in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials and equipment which have contributed to the unit operations;</p>
                  <p>(B) Provides for a fair and equitable determination of the cost of unit operations, including capital investment, and establishes a fair and equitable method for allocating such costs to the separately owned tracts and for the payment of such costs by the persons owning such tracts, either directly or out of such person's respective share of unit production;</p>
                  <p>(C) If necessary, prescribes fair, reasonable and equitable terms and conditions as to time and rate of interest for carrying or otherwise financing any person who is unable to promptly meet his financial obligations in connection with the unit;</p>
                  <p>(D) Provides that each owner shall have a vote in the supervision and conduct of unit operations corresponding to the percentage of costs of unit operations chargeable against the interests of such person; and</p>
                  <p>(E) Provides for fair and equitable terms and conditions for removal of unit operator and for appointment of a successor unit operator.</p>
                  <p>(f) No order of the commission authorizing the commencement of unit operations shall become effective until the plan of unitization has been signed or in writing ratified or approved by those persons who own at least eighty percent (80%) of the unit production or proceeds thereof that will be credited to royalty and overriding royalty interests which are free of costs, and unless both the plan of unitization and the operating plan, if any, have been signed, or in writing approved or ratified, by those persons who will be required to pay at least eighty percent (80%) of the cost of unit operations. However, to the extent that overriding royalty interests are in excess of a total of twelve and one-half percent (12 1/2%) of the production from any tract, such excess interests shall not be considered in determining the percentage of approval or ratification by such cost-free interests. If such consent has not been obtained at the time the commission order is made, the commission shall, upon application, hold such supplemental hearings and make such findings as may be required to determine when and if such consent has been obtained. Notice of such supplemental hearing shall be given by regular mail at least fifteen (15) days prior to such hearing to each person owning interests in the oil and gas in the proposed unit area whose name and address was required by the provisions of paragraph (c)(ii) of this section to be listed in the application for such unit operations. If the required percentages of consent have not been obtained within a period of six (6) months from and after the date on which the order of approval is made, such order shall be ineffective and revoked by the commission, unless, for good cause shown, the commission extends that time. Any interested person may file an application with the commission requesting an order applicable only to the proposed unit area described in the application which shall provide for the percentage of approval or ratification by either cost-free or cost-bearing interests, or both, to be reduced from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). The application shall contain the information required by subsection (c) of this section and any order of the commission entered pursuant to the application must comply with subsection (e) of this section. Notice of the hearing on the application shall be given in the same manner and to the same persons as required by subsection (d) of this section. If the commission finds that negotiations were being conducted on the effective date of this act or have been conducted for a period of at least nine (9) months prior to the filing of the application, that the applicant has participated in the negotiations diligently and in good faith, and that the percentage of approval or ratification required by this subsection cannot be obtained, the commission may reduce any percentage of approval or ratification required by this section from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). Such an order shall affect only the unit area described in the application and shall operate only to approve the proposed plan of unitization and proposed operating plan and to reduce the required percentage of approval or ratification thereof and shall not change any other requirement contained in this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) From and after the effective date of an order of the commission entered under the provisions of this section, the operation of any well producing from the unit area defined in the order by persons other than the unit operator or persons acting under the unit operator's authority, or except in the manner and to the extent provided in the plan of unitization approved by the order, shall be unlawful and is hereby prohibited.</p>
                  <p>(h) An order entered by the commission under this section, or an agreement under subsection (a) of this section establishing a unit area under which waterflooding or other recovery operations involving the introduction of extraneous forms of energy into the pool have been conducted, may be amended in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order or previous agreement: provided, (i) if the amendment affects only the rights of owners, then consent to the amendment by those persons who will be credited with unit production or proceeds thereof free of cost shall not be required; and (ii) no amendatory order shall change the percentage for the allocation of oil and gas as established by the original order or previous agreement, except with the written consent of those persons who own at least eighty percent (80%) of the unit production or proceeds thereof that will be credited to royalty and overriding royalty interests which are free of costs, and of those persons who will be required to pay at least eighty percent (80%) of the cost of unit operations, nor change the percentage for the allocation of costs as established by the original order or previous agreement, except with the written consent of those persons who own at least eighty percent (80%) of the unit production or proceeds thereof that will be credited to royalty and overriding royalty interests which are free of costs, and of those persons who will be required to pay at least eighty percent (80%) of the cost of unit operations. However, to the extent that overriding royalty interests are in excess of a total of twelve and one-half percent (12 1/2%) of the production from any tract, such excess interests shall not be considered in determining the percentage of approval or ratification by such cost-free interests. If such consent has not been obtained at the time the commission order is made, the commission shall, upon application, hold such supplemental hearings and make such findings as may be required to determine when and if such consent has been obtained. Notice of such supplemental hearing shall be given by regular mail at least fifteen (15) days prior to such hearing to each person owning interests in the oil and gas in the unit area whose name and address was required by the provisions of paragraph (c)(ii) of this section to be listed in the application for such unit operations. If the required percentages of consent have not been obtained within a period of six (6) months from and after the date on which the order of approval is made, such order shall be ineffective and revoked by the commission, unless, for good cause shown, the commission extends that time. Any interested person may file an application with the commission requesting an order applicable only to the unit area described in the application which shall provide for the percentage of approval or ratification by either cost-free or cost-bearing interests, or both, to be reduced from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). The application shall contain the information required by subsection (c) of this section and any order of the commission entered pursuant to the application must comply with subsection (e) of this section. Notice of the hearing on the application shall be given in the same manner and to the same persons as required by subsection (d) of this section. If the commission finds that negotiations were being conducted on the effective date of this act or have been conducted for a period of at least nine (9) months prior to the filing of the application, that the applicant has participated in the negotiations diligently and in good faith, and that the percentage of approval or ratification required by this subsection cannot be obtained, the commission may reduce any percentage of approval or ratification required by this section from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). Such an order shall affect only the unit area described in the application and shall operate only to approve a proposed plan of unitization and a proposed operating plan and to reduce the required percentage of approval or ratification thereof and shall not change any other requirement contained in this section.</p>
                  <p>(j) Upon application by any interested person, the commission, by order may, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order, provide for the unit operation of a pool or pools, or parts thereof, that embrace a unit area established by a previous order of the commission or that embrace a unit area previously established by a previous agreement under which waterflooding or other recovery operations involving the introduction of extraneous form of energy into the pool have been conducted. Such order in providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first treat the unit area previously established as a single tract, and the portion of unit production so allocated thereto shall then be allocated among the separately owned tracts included in such previously established unit area in the same proportions as those specified in the previous order or such previous agreement as the case may be.</p>
                  <p>(k) All operations, including, but not limited to, the commencement, drilling, or operation of a well upon any portion of the unit area for all purposes shall be deemed to be the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit area by the owner or owners thereof. The portion of the unit production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit area shall, when produced, be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such tract by a well drilled thereon. Operations conducted pursuant to an order of the commission providing for unit operations shall constitute a fulfillment of all the express or implied obligations of each lease or contract covering lands in the unit area to the extent that compliance with such obligations cannot be had because of the orders of the commission. Whenever the commission enters an order providing for a unit operation, any lease, other than a state or federal lease, which covers lands that are in part within the unit area embraced in any such plan of unitization and that are in part outside of such unit area shall be vertically segregated into separate leases, one (1) covering all formations underlying the lands within such unit area and the other covering all formations underlying the lands outside each unit area, such segregation to be effective as of the anniversary date of such lease next ensuing after the expiration of ninety (90) days from the effective date of unitization; provided, however, that any such segregated lease as to the outside lands shall continue in force and effect for the primary term thereof, but not for less than two (2) years from the date of such segregation and so long thereafter as operations are conducted under the provisions of the lease. If any such lease provides for a lump-sum rental and if rentals become payable under any segregated lease covering the outside land, such lump-sum rental shall be prorated between such segregated leases on an acreage basis.</p>
                  <p>(m) The portion of the unit production allocated to any tract, and the proceeds from the sale thereof, shall be the property and income of the several persons to whom, or to whose credit, the same are allocated or payable under the order providing for unit operations.</p>
                  <p>(n) No division order or other contract relating to the sale or purchase of production from a separately owned tract shall be terminated by the order providing for unit operations, but shall remain in force and apply to oil and gas allocated to such tract until terminated in accordance with the provisions thereof.</p>
                  <p>(o) Except to the extent that the parties affected so agree, no order providing for unit operations shall be construed to result in a transfer of all or any part of the title of any person to the oil and gas rights in any tract in the unit area. All property, whether real or personal that may be acquired for the account of the owners within the unit area, shall be the property of such owners in the proportion that the expenses of unit operations are charged.</p>
                  <p>(p) Subject to the limitations set forth in this section, and to such further limitations as may be set forth in the plan of unitization and operating plan, the operator of the unit shall have a first and prior lien for costs incurred pursuant to the plan of unitization and operating plan upon each owner's oil and gas rights and his share of unitized production to secure the payment of such owner's proportionate part of the costs of developing and operating the unit area. The lien may be established and enforced in the same manner as provided by W.S. 29-3-101 through 29-3-111. For such purposes any nonconsenting owner shall be deemed to have contracted with the unit operator for his proportionate part of the cost of developing and operating the unit area. A transfer or conversion of any owner's interest or any portion thereof however accomplished after the effective date of the order creating the unit, shall not relieve the transferred interest of said operator's lien on said interest for the cost and expense of unit operations.</p>
                  <p>(q) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this section to the contrary, any person who owns an interest in oil or gas within the unit area which is not subject to an oil and gas lease or similar contract, shall, with respect to seven-eighths of the interest, be deemed to be an owner obligated to pay all costs of unit operations attributable to the interest and shall be deemed to be a royalty owner to the extent of one-eighth of the interest free from the costs.</p>
                  <p>(r) The provisions of subsections (b) through (q) of this section shall never be applicable for the purpose of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Changing the terms of unit agreements under which waterflooding or other recovery operations involving the introduction of extraneous forms of energy into a pool have been conducted prior to the effective date of this section or changing the rights of either any person who has executed or ratified a preexisting unit agreement or any person who, being qualified to become a party to a preexisting unit agreement and having received an opportunity to become a party thereto, has failed or refused to execute or ratify the agreement; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subjecting the interest of any person in the oil and gas in the unit area to a unit agreement which allocates unit production to such interest under a formula based solely upon the surface acreage of the separate tracts within the unit area.</p>
                  <p>(s) A certified copy of any order of the commission entered under the provisions of this section shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of the county clerk for the counties where all or any portion of the unit area is located, and such recordation shall constitute notice thereof to all persons.</p>
                  <p>(t) If any section, subsection, sentence or clause of this section is adjudged to be unconstitutional or invalid, such adjudication shall not affect any other portions of this section which can be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.</p>

In all cases where a complaint is made by the commission, or by the state oil and gas supervisor or by any party that any provision of this act, or any rule, regulation or order of the commission is being violated, notice of the hearing on such complaint shall be served on the parties charged with such violation by any officer authorized by law to serve summons in civil actions or by an agent authorized and directed by the commission or its secretary, in the same manner as is provided in the code of civil procedure for service of process in civil actions in the district courts of this state; proof of such service by an officer shall be in the form provided by law with respect to civil process and proof of such service by an agent shall be by such agent's affidavit.</p>

                  <p>(a) The commission shall have the power to summon witnesses, to administer oaths, and to require the production of records, books, and documents for examination at any hearing or investigation conducted by it. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying, or from producing books, papers, and records before the commission or a court, or from obedience to the subpoena of the commission or a court, on the ground or for reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture; provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring any person to produce any books, papers, or records, or to testify in response to any inquiry not pertinent to some question lawfully before the commission or court for determination. No natural person shall be subjected to criminal prosecution or to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which, in spite of his objection, he may be required to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the commission or court, or in obedience to a subpoena; provided, that no person testifying shall be exempted from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.</p>
                  <p>(b) Nothing in this act, and no suit by or against the commission, and no violation charged or asserted against any person under any provisions of this act, or any rule, regulation or order issued hereunder, shall impair or abridge or delay any cause of action for damages which any person may have or assert against any other person violating any provision of this act, or any rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder. Any person so damaged by the violation may sue for and recover such damages as he otherwise may be entitled to receive. In the event the commission shall fail to bring suit to enjoin any actual or threatened violation of this act, or of any rule, regulation or order made hereunder, then any person or party in interest adversely affected and who has notified the commission in writing of such violation or threat thereof and has requested the commission to sue, may, to prevent any or further violation, bring suit for that purpose in the district court of any county in which the commission could have brought suit. If, in such suit, the court holds that injunctive relief should be granted, then the commission may be made a party and the court may in its discretion order the commission to be substituted for the person who brought the suit or the injunction issue as to the court may be deemed meet and proper in the premises.</p>
                  <p>(c) In case of failure or refusal on the part of any person to comply with a subpoena issued by the commission, or in case of the refusal of any witness to testify as to any matter regarding which he may be interrogated, any district court in the state, upon the application of the commission, may in term time or vacation issue an attachment for such person and compel him to comply with such subpoena, and to attend before the commission and produce such records, books and documents for examination, and to give his testimony. Such court shall have the power to punish for contempt as in the case of disobedience to a like subpoena issued by the court, or for refusal to testify therein.</p>

Any case on appeal shall have precedence over any other case then pending in such court.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to the foregoing, any person who may feel himself aggrieved by any rule, regulation, order or decision of the commission may have an appeal as provided by law, with respect to appeals from decisions of the board of land commissioners.

                  <p>(d) No temporary restraining order or injunction of any kind against the commission or its agents, employees, or representatives, or the attorney general, shall become effective until the plaintiff shall execute a bond in such amount and upon such conditions as the court may direct, and such bond is approved by the judge of the court and filed with the clerk of the court. The bond shall be made payable to the state of Wyoming, and shall be for the use and benefit of all persons who may be injured by the acts done under the protection of the restraining order or injunction, if the rule, regulation or order is upheld. No suit on the bond may be brought after six (6) months from the date of the final determination of the suit in which the restraining order or injunction was issued.</p>
                  <p>(e) A suit or an appeal involving a test of the validity of any provision of this act, or a rule, regulation, or order shall be advanced for trial and be determined as expeditiously as feasible, and no postponement or continuance thereof shall be granted unless deemed imperative by the court. The court shall consider all the evidence, shall not be bound by any finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the commission, shall hold a trial de novo, shall pass on the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony, and shall determine independently all issues of fact and of law with respect to the validity and reasonableness of the provision, rule, regulation, or order complained of.</p>
                  <p>(f) No suit, action or other proceeding based upon a violation of this act or any rule, regulation or order of the commission hereunder shall be commenced or maintained unless same shall have been commenced within one (1) year from the date of the alleged violation.</p>

                  <p>Whenever it appears that any person is violating or threatening to violate any provision of this act or any rule, regulation, or order of the commission, the commission shall bring suit in the name of the state against such person in the district court in the county of the residence of the defendant, or in the county of the residence of any defendant if there be more than one (1) defendant, or in the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred, or is threatened, to restrain such person from continuing such violation or from carrying out the threat of violation. In such suit the commission may seek to recover penalties for violations. Upon the filing of any such suit, summons issued to such person may be directed to the sheriff of any county in this state for service by such sheriff or a deputy. In any such suit, the court may grant injunctions, prohibitory and mandatory, including temporary restraining orders and temporary injunctions.

                  <p>(a) Civil penalties collected under this act shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited as provided in W.S. 8-1-109. All other monies collected by the commission under the provisions of this act shall be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in a separate account. Expenses incident to the administration of this act shall include expenses for capital construction and shall be paid out of the account. One half (1/2) of the money so collected may be expended as needed by the commission for capital construction purposes.</p>
                  <p>(b) There is assessed on the fair cash market value as provided by W.S. 39-14-203, of all oil and gas produced, sold or transported from the premises in Wyoming a charge not to exceed eight-tenths of one (1) mill ($.0008) on the dollar. The commission shall by order fix the amount of the charge in the first instance and may reduce or increase the amount as the expenses chargeable may require. The amounts fixed by the commission shall not exceed the limit prescribed above. It is the duty of the commission to collect all assessments. All monies collected shall be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in a separate account and used exclusively to pay the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of W.S. 30-5-101 through 30-5-119. The persons owning a working interest, royalty interest, payments out of production, or any other interest in the oil and gas or in the proceeds thereof, subject to the charge in this subsection are liable for the charge in proportion to their ownership at the time of production. The charge so assessed is payable monthly. The sum due is payable to the commission, on or before the twenty-fifth of the second month following the month in which the charge accrued by the producer on behalf of himself and all other interested persons. If there is a sale of oil or gas within this state the charge is payable by the purchaser. Any charge not paid within the time specified bears interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of delinquency until paid. This charge together with the interest is a lien upon the oil or gas against which it is levied and assessed. The person paying the charge as provided is authorized and required to deduct from any amounts due the persons owning an interest in the oil and gas or in the proceeds at the time of production the proportionate amount of the charge before making the payment. Subsection (b) of this section shall apply to all lands in the state of Wyoming, notwithstanding the provisions of W.S. 30-5-118, however, there is exempted from the charge as levied and assessed the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The interest of the United States of America and the interest of the state of Wyoming and the political subdivisions thereof in any oil or gas or in the proceeds thereof;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The interest of any Indian or Indian tribe in any oil or gas or in the proceeds thereof, produced from land subject to the supervision of the United States;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Oil and gas used in producing operations or for repressuring or recycling purposes.</p>

                  <p>(a) The proceeds derived from the sale of production from any well producing oil, gas or related hydrocarbons in the state of Wyoming shall be paid to all persons legally entitled thereto, except as hereinafter provided, commencing not later than six (6) months after the first day of the month following the date of first sale and thereafter not later than sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar month within which subsequent production is sold, unless other periods or arrangements for the first and subsequent payments are provided for in a valid contract with the person or persons entitled to such proceeds. Payment shall be made directly to the person or persons entitled thereto by the lessee or operator or by any party who assumes such payment obligation under any legal arrangement.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) Payments shall be remitted to the person or persons entitled to proceeds from production annually for the aggregate of up to twelve (12) months accumulation of proceeds if the total amount owed is one hundred dollars ($100.00) or less;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (i) of this subsection, upon written request of the payee, payments shall be remitted to the payee within sixty (60) days following receipt of the request if the aggregation of the proceeds is twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or greater;</p>

                  <p>Any delay in determining any person legally entitled to an interest in the proceeds from production shall not affect payments to all other persons entitled to payment. In instances where payment cannot be made for any reason within the time limits specified in W.S. 30-5-301(a), the lessee or operator, purchaser or other party legally responsible for payment shall deposit all proceeds credited to the eventual interest owner to an escrow account in a federally insured bank or savings and loan institution in Wyoming, using a standard escrow document form approved by the attorney general of Wyoming, which deposit shall earn interest at the highest rate being offered by that institution for the amount and term of such deposits. The escrow agent may commingle monies received into escrow from any one lessee or operator, purchaser or other party legally responsible for payment. Payment of principal and accrued interest from such accounts shall be paid by the escrow agent to all persons legally entitled thereto within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the escrow agent of final legal determination of entitlement thereto. If the escrow agent is unable to deliver the payment to the legally entitled person within three (3) years from the end of the month in which the escrow agent first received notice of the person legally entitled to the payment, the payment shall be considered unclaimed for purposes of W.S. 34-24-101 through 34-24-139. Applicable escrow fees shall be deducted from the payments.</p>

                  <p>(a) The surety bond or other guaranty required under W.S. 30-5-402(c)(iv) shall be executed by the oil and gas operator, or a bonding company acceptable to the commission. Other forms of guaranty acceptable by the commission under article 1 of this chapter may be submitted by the oil and gas operator in lieu of a surety bond.</p>
                  <p>(b) The surety bond or other guaranty shall be in an amount of not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per well site on the land unless the operations involve seismic activities. If the operations involve seismic activities, the surety bond shall be as provided in W.S. 30-5-104(d)(v)(A). As used in this subsection, seismic activities do not include waves or vibrations originating outside the property in question. At the request of the oil and gas operator, after attempted consultation with the surface owner the commission may establish a blanket bond or other guaranty in an amount covering oil and gas operations on the surface owner's land as identified by an oil and gas operator in the written notice required under W.S. 30-5-402(e), provided the blanket bond shall be in an amount not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per well site on the surface owner's land. Neither the minimum amount of the bond or other guaranty specified or referenced in this subsection nor a blanket bond or other guaranty established by the commission is intended to establish any amount for reasonable and foreseeable damages. A permit to conduct geophysical/seismic operations issued under the authority of W.S. 30-5-104 shall include a statement that it shall not constitute authorization or permission to trespass on the surface estate. The commission shall not accept a surety bond for seismic activities for land which the oil and gas operator or seismic activity operator has no right to enter. The operator shall provide evidence of the right to enter derived from one (1) or more mineral interest owners.</p>
                  <p>(c) Within seven (7) days following receipt of a surety bond or other guaranty or the establishment of a blanket bond or other guaranty specified or referenced in this section, the commission shall notify the surface owner of receipt of the surety bond or other guaranty or the establishment of a blanket bond or other guaranty based on the oil and gas operator's request and the written notice required under W.S. 30-5-402(e). The commission's notice shall also include a description of the amount and the type of the bond or guaranty received or established and provide to the surface owner a copy of the statement required under W.S. 30-5-403(a). If, at the expiration of thirty (30) days after receipt of the commission's notice by the surface owner, he makes no objection to the amount or the type of the surety bond or guaranty, the commission shall approve the surety bond or guaranty. If the surface owner objects in writing to the amount or the type of the surety bond or guaranty, the commission shall give immediate consideration to the surety bond or guaranty objected to and the accompanying papers filed by the oil and gas operator in support of the surety bond or guaranty amount and the type of surety bond or guaranty submitted or established, and the surface owner's objections, and the commission shall render a final decision as to the acceptability of the amount and type of the surety bond or guaranty and shall notify the parties of the decision.
