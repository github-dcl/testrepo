                <p>(xvii) Direct proceedings, actions and prosecutions to be instituted to enforce the laws relating to the liability and punishment of persons for failure or neglect to comply with the provisions of the laws of this state governing the return, assessment and taxation of property, and cause complaints to be made against county assessors, members of county boards of equalization, or any other assessing or taxing officers, to the proper authority, for their removal from office for misconduct or neglect of duty;</p>

                <p>(a) The governor shall appoint, with senate confirmation, three (3) persons who shall constitute the state board of equalization who are the department's board of appeals. Not more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the board members may be members of the same political party. Each appointment of the board members shall be for a six (6) year term.</p>
                <p>(b) The board shall elect a chairman and a vice-chairman who shall serve for two (2) years.</p>
                <p>(c) The state board of equalization shall perform the duties specified in article 15, section 10 of the Wyoming constitution and shall hear appeals from county boards of equalization and review final decisions of the department upon application of any interested person adversely affected, including boards of county commissioners for the purposes of this subsection, under the contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. Upon request of a county board of equalization providing compelling reasons to do so, the state board of equalization may accept a case certified directly to the state board of equalization pursuant to rules adopted by the state board of equalization. The state board of equalization shall accept a case certified directly to the state board of equalization that involves property that may subject a county to tax liability as provided in W.S. 39-13-102(c)(iv). The board shall also review final decisions of the department of transportation concerning the assessment or application of taxes authorized under this title upon application of any interested person adversely affected. Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the board. In addition, the board shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Manage its internal affairs and prescribe rules of practice and procedure;</p>
                <p>(ii) Prescribe the form for the abstract of the assessment roll, examine and compare the abstracts of the counties and equalize the same, so that all taxable property in the state is assessed at its fair market value, and to that end shall add to or deduct from the aggregate valuation of the property, or any class or classes of property, in any county such percent as will bring the same to its fair market value. When any assessed valuation is to be increased or decreased, the board shall provide not less than twenty (20) days notice of the proposed action to the county board of equalization and county assessor of the county in which the property is situated. If requested, the state board of equalization shall provide an opportunity for a hearing for the county board of equalization and assessor of the affected county. The hearing shall be held in the affected county. After a hearing, if requested, the county board of equalization shall take the necessary action to effectuate the action taken by the state board of equalization. The state board of equalization shall certify the valuation to be used for all tax levies on or before the first Monday in August. The board shall communicate its equalization actions to the department, along with any recommendations for improved work practices of county assessors;</p>
                <p>(iii) When in the opinion of the board, it would be of assistance in equalizing values under paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the board may require any county assessor to furnish statements showing assessments of the property of any person within the county. The board shall consider and equalize county assessments under paragraph (ii) of this subsection and may increase or decrease assessments returned by the county board of equalization when the property so assessed appears to be over-valued or under-valued, first giving notice to those persons affected. The notice shall fix a time and place of hearing. Any affected person may appeal from the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property is situated;</p>
                <p>(iv) Decide all questions that may arise with reference to the construction of any statute affecting the assessment, levy and collection of taxes, in accordance with the rules, regulations, orders and instructions prescribed by the department:</p>
                <p>(A) Upon application of any person adversely affected; or</p>
                <p>(B) In performing its responsibilities to equalize values, including with respect to the suitability of the system prescribed by the department for establishing fair market value.</p>

The county assessor shall extend the date for listing personal property from March 1 to April 1 upon written request of the property owner provided the written request is made not later than February 15.

                <p>(viii) Every assessment schedule sent to a taxpayer shall contain the property's estimated fair market value for the current and previous year, or, productive value in the case of agricultural property. The schedule shall also contain the assessment ratio as provided by paragraph (b)(iii) of this section for the taxable property, the amount of taxes assessed on the taxable property from the previous year, and an estimate of the taxes which will be due and payable for the current year based on the previous year's mill levies. The schedule shall contain a statement of the process to contest assessments as prescribed by W.S. 39-13-109(b)(i);</p>
                <p>(ix) If machinery or equipment is located in two (2) or more counties during the calendar year, the county assessors of the respective counties, or the department of revenue if the assessors cannot agree, shall meet and prorate the assessed valuation of the machinery or equipment among the counties pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the department. The rules and regulations may reflect such factors as the home location of the machinery or equipment, the time the machinery or equipment will be in each county, or the monetary value of work to be done in each county by the owner or user of the machinery or equipment;</p>
                <p>(x) The following shall apply to agricultural land:</p>
                <p>(A) The department shall determine the taxable value of agricultural land and prescribe the form of the sworn statement to be used by the property owner to declare that the property meets the requirements of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. In determining the taxable value for assessment purposes under this paragraph, the value of agricultural land shall be based on the current use of the land, and the capability of the land to produce agricultural products, including grazing and forage, based on average yields of lands of the same classification under normal conditions. The area of land used for a farmstead structure shall be valued at the same value as the agricultural land supported;</p>
                <p>(B) Contiguous or noncontiguous parcels of land under one (1) operation owned or leased shall qualify for classification as agricultural land if the land meets each of the following qualifications:</p>
                <p>(I) The land is presently being used and employed for an agricultural purpose including use as a farmstead to support an agricultural purpose as provided in W.S. 39-13-101(a)(viii)(D);</p>
                <p>(II) The land is not part of a platted subdivision, except for a parcel of thirty-five (35) acres or more which otherwise qualifies as agricultural land;</p>
                <p>(III) If the land is not leased land, the owner of the land has derived annual gross revenues of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) from the marketing of agricultural products, or if the land is leased land the lessee has derived annual gross revenues of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) from the marketing of agricultural products. If a portion of the land is used for a farmstead structure, that area of the land upon which the structure is built and which supports the use of the structure shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this subdivision if the farmstead structure is part of one (1) operation that meets the requirements of this subdivision; and</p>
                <p>(IV) The land has been used or employed, consistent with the land's size, location and capability to produce as defined by department rules and the mapping and agricultural manual published by the department, primarily in an agricultural operation, or the land does not meet this requirement and the requirement of subdivision (III) of this subparagraph because the producer:</p>
                <p>(1) Experiences an intervening cause of production failure beyond its control;</p>
                <p>(2) Causes a marketing delay for economic advantage;</p>
                <p>(3) Participates in a bona fide conservation program, in which case proof by an affidavit showing qualification in a previous year shall suffice; or (4) Has planted a crop that will not yield an income in the tax year.</p>
                <p>(C) If needed, the county assessor may require the producer to provide a sworn affidavit affirming that the land meets the requirements of this paragraph. When deemed necessary, the county assessor may further require supporting documentation.</p>
                <p>(xi) The following shall apply to water and reservoir rights:</p>
                <p>(A) Water rights and reservoir rights originating in Wyoming and appurtenant to and beneficially used in connection with lands within Wyoming shall be assessed and taxed with the lands. All other water rights and reservoir rights originating in Wyoming shall be separately assessed and listed for taxation at the place of origin of the water or reservoir rights;</p>
                <p>(B) On or before April 1 the manager of any reservoir in which water is impounded or stored within Wyoming for use in another state shall furnish the names and addresses of all persons entitled to receive the water and the number of acre feet each person is entitled to receive to the county assessor of the county in which the reservoir is located;</p>
                <p>(C) On or before May 1 the county treasurer shall certify to the water commissioner of the district in which the county is located the names of all persons whose taxes are delinquent on water and reservoir rights situated in the county which were listed and assessed separately from land, the number of acre feet assessed and taxed to each person on which taxes are delinquent and the name and location of the reservoir. Upon certification by the county treasurer the water commissioner shall regulate or cause to be regulated the headgates of the reservoir or other delivery facilities to prevent delivery of water to delinquent taxpayers until the commissioner is furnished a tax receipt from the county treasurer showing the delinquent taxes have been paid;</p>
                <p>(D) As used in this paragraph "water rights" and "reservoir rights" include any proportionate interest in any well, ditch, dam, reservoir, and the storage capacity therein, easement or other instrumentality including any affixed or unaffixed sprinkler irrigation system necessary to the use and enjoyment of the rights.</p>
                <p>(xii) The following shall apply to special tax imposed on property owned by the game and fish commission:</p>
                <p>(A) There is imposed upon all real property owned by the Wyoming game and fish commission a special tax computed as provided in this paragraph which shall be in lieu of ad valorem property tax. The special tax shall be determined as follows:</p>
                <p>(I) For property used for wildlife management purposes, the tax shall be equal to the amount of the ad valorem tax for that property had it been levied and assessed based upon the taxable value of agricultural land of similar productive value under W.S. 39-13-101(a) and paragraph (b)(x) of this section;</p>
                <p>(II) For property used for any other purpose, the tax shall be equal to the amount of the ad valorem tax for that property had it been levied and assessed based upon the taxable value of similar property valued at fair market value as provided by paragraph (b)(ii) of this section.</p>
                <p>(B) For the purpose of valuation, assessment, collection, distribution of tax collected and all other matters related to this special tax, the administration of this tax shall be as if this tax were an ad valorem tax on the property. The Wyoming game and fish commission shall constitute a person against whom property is assessed, as returned by the county assessor, and from whom taxes are collected.</p>
                <p>(xiii) For minerals and mine products, the taxpayer may request a value determination from the department and propose a value determination method which may be used until the department issues a value determination. The taxpayer shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal and any additional information the department deems necessary. After the department issues its determination, the taxpayer shall make adjustments based upon the value established or request a hearing by the board;</p>
                <p>(xiv) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                <p>(xv) For mines and mining claims, the department may presume that the property is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions found in chapter 14 of this title. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                <p>(xvi) The following shall apply to the valuation of rail car companies:</p>
                <p>(A) The department shall ascertain from the statements required from the rail car companies and the reports made by the railway companies operating in the state the total mileage of the rail cars of each company for the period of one (1) year within this state. The department shall determine the number of rail cars of each company by determining the number of cars which if kept in the state would be reasonably required in making the mileage, and this number of cars shall be the number of cars on which each company shall be assessed for that year;</p>
                <p>(B) The department shall fix the valuation upon each particular class of rail cars, which as nearly as possible shall be the fair market value of the cars, and the number ascertained shall be assessed to the company. The department may base the assessment upon the returns of the several railroad companies;</p>
                <p>(C) In case any company fails or refuses to make the required statement, the department shall fix the fair market value of the rail cars, and in determining the number and value of cars the department, insofar as practicable, shall harmonize the statements of the several rail car companies, with respect thereto and the assessment shall be included in the records and proceedings of the department.</p>
                <p>(xvii) For the valuation of vacant land within a platted subdivision development, the county assessor shall consider the value of the property through the use of present worth appraisal methodology upon request of the property owner.</p>
                <p>(c) Taxpayer. As between the grantor and grantee of any property where there is no express agreement in writing as to which party shall pay the taxes that may be assessed on the property, if the property is conveyed on or after January 1, the grantor shall pay the taxes for that year.</p>

If a property owner fails to provide a listing of personal property owned by him or under his control by March 1, unless an extension is granted from the assessor in writing, the assessor shall issue an assessment of personal property from the best information available. The county assessor shall extend the date for listing personal property from March 1 to April 1 upon written request of the property owner provided the written request is made not later than February 15. The county assessor or his deputies or any representative of the department may examine any property. The county assessor or his deputies shall enter the fair market value of the property for taxation on the assessment roll. The owner, or his agent, shall make and subscribe the following oath:</p>

The department may use information other than contained in the statement provided by paragraph (ii) of this subsection to determine the fair market value of the property provided by W.S. 39-13-102(m).</p>
                <p>(b) The following provisions shall apply to the payment of taxes, distraint of property and deferral:</p>
                <p>(i) The following shall apply to the payment of taxes due:</p>
                <p>(A) On or before the first Monday of August, the board of county commissioners shall by order entered of record levy the requisite taxes for the year. On or before the third Monday in August the county assessor shall compute the taxes from the corrected valuations as corrected by the state board and entered by the county assessor in the column of corrected valuations. The county assessor shall deliver the tax list and his warrant for the collection of the taxes to the county treasurer setting forth the assessment roll, with the taxes extended, containing in tabular form and alphabetical order the names of persons in whose names property has been listed in the county, with the classes of property and the value, total amount of taxes and column of numbers and values and total taxes footed commanding the treasurer to collect the taxes. At the end of the tax list and warrant, the county assessor shall prorate the total taxes levied to the several funds;</p>
                <p>(B) The county treasurer upon receiving the tax list and warrant shall immediately proceed to collect the taxes levied for the current year and taxes remaining unpaid from preceding years. The county treasurer shall issue receipts for taxes paid, specifying the kind of tax and when paid, and enter the payment on the tax list;</p>
                <p>(C) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement to each taxpayer by mail at his last known address or, if offered by the county and upon request of the taxpayer, by electronic transmission of the total tax due, itemized as to property description, assessed value and mill levies. The notice shall contain information, including contact information, of any property tax relief program authorized by state law. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                <p>(D) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 39-13- 113, taxes provided by this act are due and payable at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                <p>(E) As between the grantor and grantee of any property where there is no express agreement in writing as to which party shall pay the taxes that may be assessed on the property, if the property is conveyed on or after January 1, the grantor shall pay the taxes for that year.</p>
                <p>(ii) The following shall apply to the distraint of property:</p>
                <p>(A) The following shall apply to the removal of property subject to tax:</p>
                <p>(I) If the county treasurer has reasonable grounds to believe that any taxable property in the county will be removed from the county before the tax due or to become due has been paid, he may take possession of so much of the property as will be necessary to pay the taxes due or to become due for the year plus the costs incident to keeping the property. The property shall be released if the amount necessary to pay the taxes plus costs is deposited with the county treasurer;</p>
                <p>(II) If the tax list and warrant have been delivered to the county treasurer, taxes are immediately due if circumstances provided by subdivision (I) of this subparagraph are present, and the county treasurer may levy distress against the property;</p>
                <p>(III) When acting pursuant to subdivision</p>
                <p>(I) of this subparagraph the county treasurer may seize property in any county of the state. When acting pursuant to subdivision</p>
                <p>(II) of this subparagraph the county treasurer may forward the tax claim to the county treasurer of any county in which the property may be found who shall proceed to collect the taxes as provided by subdivision (II) of this subparagraph.</p>
                <p>(B) The following shall apply to the distraint of property for nonpayment:</p>
                <p>(I) Annually, the county treasurer shall declare any taxes remaining unpaid on May 11 delinquent, and on or before May 21 shall certify a list of delinquent taxes and taxpayers, indicating the years for which payment is delinquent, which constitutes the delinquent tax roll or list of the county for the years covered thereby. The county treasurer shall stamp upon each line of the delinquent tax roll "Delinquent May 11, ...." but failure to do so does not invalidate subsequent collection proceedings;</p>
                <p>(II) Following certification of the delinquent tax roll or list, the county treasurer shall demand payment of all delinquent taxes plus interest from the taxpayers listed therein;</p>
                <p>(III) In the event of nonpayment of delinquent taxes and interest following demand therefor, the county treasurer shall proceed to collect the delinquent taxes, interest and costs provided by W.S. 39-13-108(b)(ii) and 39-13-108(e)(ix) by levying distress against the real or personal property of the delinquent taxpayer as may be most convenient except a homestead may only be sold for taxes due upon it exclusively. The county treasurer may distrain and sell personal property even if the delinquent taxpayer has real property in the county, or may sell real property even if the delinquent taxpayer has personal property in the county subject to the homestead exception stated above.</p>
                <p>(iii) The following shall apply to the deferral of tax collection:</p>
                <p>(A) On or before November 10 of the year taxes are levied and upon the filing of an affidavit demonstrating an adequate showing that he is qualified under subparagraph (N) of this paragraph and if his principal residence is located on a parcel of land not more than forty (40) acres, any person may apply to the board of county commissioners for deferral of the collection of not to exceed one-half (1/2) of any real estate ad valorem taxes owed by the property owner on his principal residence. The board of county commissioners of each county may promulgate rules and regulations necessary to administer the provisions of this paragraph including guidelines for a taxpayer to demonstrate qualification and provisions allowing or requiring annual payment of a portion of the taxes or interest on deferred taxes. All rules, regulations, guidelines, forms and other program information shall be submitted to the department prior to July 1 of the year the deferral program is implemented in the county. The board of county commissioners may implement the program unless disapproved in writing by the department within forty-five (45) days of submission. If at least ten (10) residents of a county who are qualified under subparagraph (N) of this paragraph submit a petition to the board of county commissioners, the board of county commissioners shall hold a hearing within thirty (30) days on the issue of whether to promulgate rules to enable the qualified residents of the county to participate in the tax deferral program authorized under this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(B) Any deferral of collection of taxes granted by the board of county commissioners shall constitute a perpetual tax lien against the property pursuant to W.S. 39-13-108(d)(i) with priority over any other lien. The taxpayer shall file an affidavit each year demonstrating qualification including any significant change to his financial status. If the board of county commissioners finds that the taxpayer's financial status to qualify under subdivision (N)(I) of this paragraph has significantly changed, the board of county commissioners shall, by written order, declare any taxes deferred due and payable on an earlier date. Unless declared to be due earlier, any taxes deferred shall be due and payable upon a significant change in the taxpayer's financial status as determined by the board of county commissioners, abandonment of the property, failure to file annually the affidavit required by this paragraph, the death of the property owner or the sale or transfer of the property, whichever occurs first. If the board of county commissioners finds at any time that the total taxes deferred exceeds one-half (1/2) of the fair market value of the property as estimated by the board of county commissioners, the board of county commissioners may declare, by written order, that all deferred taxes are immediately due and payable;</p>
                <p>(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit or affect requirements for property to be listed, valued and assessed by the county assessor pursuant to law;</p>
                <p>(D) Notwithstanding W.S. 39-13-108(b)(ii), interest shall accrue on any tax collection deferral granted by the board of county commissioners at a compounded rate of four percent (4%) per annum, except for persons who qualify solely under subdivision (N)(III) of this paragraph interest shall accrue at a rate equal to the average yield on ten (10) year United States treasury bonds for the previous three (3) calendar years, plus one and one-half percent (1.5%) as determined by the state treasurer for the calendar year preceding the year in which application is made. Any tax collection deferral may be prepaid at any time without prepayment penalty;</p>
                <p>(E) Each year the county assessor shall publicize in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the county the provisions of this section and the method by which eligible persons may obtain a deferral;</p>
                <p>(F) Payment of deferred taxes shall be distributed pursuant to W.S. 39-13-111(a)(ii). Any taxes deferred under this paragraph which would be distributed pursuant to W.S. 39-13-111(a)(ii)(A) shall be paid from the county general fund subject to reimbursement when the deferred taxes are paid by the taxpayer or otherwise collected by the county;</p>
                <p>(G) The deferral option shall not be available in any county which has not adopted rules as required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, or which has received disapproval of the county program by the department;</p>
                <p>(H) If any residence is under mortgage, deed of trust or purchase contract whereby the explicit terms of the mortgage, deed or contract requires the accumulation of reserves out of which the holder of the mortgage, deed or contract is required to pay real property taxes, the holder or his authorized agent shall cosign the affidavit to defer either before a notarial officer or the county assessor or deputy in the county in which the real property is located;</p>
                <p>(J) If any residence is under rental and the terms of the rental contract require the payment of taxes by the renter, the renter may apply for the deferral provided the property owner or authorized agent also cosigns the affidavit to defer either before a notarial officer or the county assessor or deputy in the county in which the real property is located;</p>
                <p>(K) Consistent with generally accepted fiscal accounting standards, each county implementing the deferral program shall maintain adequate records pertaining to the deferral program, by legal description, owner, taxpayer, if different from owner, deferred taxes and interest, payments made against deferred taxes and interest, and any other information necessary to document and determine the status of deferred taxes and interest in the county. These records shall be updated annually or as needed, and a summary thereof shall be submitted annually to the department of revenue on or before August 10;</p>

                <p>(i) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 39-13-113, taxes provided by this act are due and payable at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied.

                <p>(d) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Taxes upon real property are a perpetual lien thereon against all persons excluding the United States and the state of Wyoming. Taxes upon personal property are a lien upon all real property owned by the person against whom the tax was assessed subject to all prior existing valid liens. Taxes upon personal property are a lien upon the personal property until paid but if the personal property is transferred before payment the tax shall be collected from other real or personal property of the transferor but if the transferor has no other property from which the taxes can be collected then payment shall be enforced from the transferred property;</p>
                <p>(ii) Any person, county, municipality or political subdivision holding a certificate of purchase or tax deed issued for delinquent taxes has a lien against the real property which is subject to the certificate of purchase or tax deed to the extent of taxes, costs and penalties accrued plus interest, accruing penalties and the value of improvements placed on the real property by the lienholder or his assigns while lawfully in possession of the premises. The lien is superior to all other liens except those created by junior tax sales or payment of subsequent taxes by another person. The lien may be enforced in the district court of the county in which the real property lies or in any district court in which an action is filed in which the lienholder is made a defendant. The action shall be conducted in a manner similar to foreclosures of mortgages and sales thereunder. The decree may contain an order of sale directing the sheriff to advertise and sell the real property without appraisal and make a return of the proceedings within sixty (60) days;</p>
                <p>(iii) Pursuant to an order of sale under paragraph</p>
                <p>(ii) of this subsection, the sheriff shall advertise the property for sale, and sell the property at public auction, without appraisal, to the highest bidder for cash. The lienholder pursuant to a certificate of purchase or tax deed may bid on the property and if he is the highest bidder, he shall only pay to the sheriff the amount by which his bid exceeds the amount due him under the court's decree. Upon confirmation of the sale by the court, the sheriff shall execute a deed conveying title to the real property to the purchaser in fee simple subject only to the rights of lienholders from junior tax sales. Any person having an interest in the real property may redeem the property prior to confirmation by the court by paying into court a sum of money sufficient to pay all sums owing to the lienholder;</p>
                <p>(iv) Upon confirmation of the sale, the proceeds of the sale shall be applied as follows:</p>
                <p>(A) To pay the costs of the action and sale including an attorney's fee to the lienholder's attorney as allowed by the court;</p>
                <p>(B) To pay all sums due the lienholder;</p>
                <p>(C) The balance to be paid to persons holding prior interests in the real property as their interests may appear. The payment may be claimed within two (2) years from the date of confirmation of the sale, or in the case of a person under a legal disability within one (1) year from removal of the disability. If the payment is unclaimed within two (2) years the proceeds shall be credited to the county sinking fund. If a person under a legal disability claims the proceeds within one (1) year following removal of the disability and the proceeds have been credited to the county sinking fund, the person shall be paid out of the county sinking fund.</p>
                <p>(v) No deficiency judgment shall be rendered against any party to an action pursuant to this subsection;</p>
                <p>(vi) Liens on mineral production before January 1, 2021. The following shall apply:</p>
                <p>(A) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed upon mineral production under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the county in which the mineral was produced subject to all prior existing liens. The lien is on all property in the county, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any taxpayer to the extent permitted by W.S. 39-14-103(c)(i), 39-14-203(c)(i), 39-14-303(c)(i), 39-14-403(c)(i), 39-14-503(c)(i), 39-14-603(c)(i) and 39-14-703(c)(i);</p>
                <p>(B) A lien under this paragraph is also a lien on all interests of the taxpayer in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral. A lien under this paragraph shall not apply to a royalty interest, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate of an owner who is not a delinquent taxpayer;</p>
                <p>(C) Any lien arising under this paragraph is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind held by any person except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by subparagraph (E) of this paragraph if the county fails to:</p>
                <p>(I) Not later than ninety (90) days after the date the tax became delinquent or was billed, whichever is later, provide notice of delinquent taxes due by certified mail to any bona fide creditor that holds a properly perfected, filed or recorded lien as set forth in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and that provided a copy of its properly perfected, filed or recorded lien to the county treasurer; and</p>
                <p>(II) Not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date the tax became delinquent or was billed, whichever is later, file its lien as provided by subparagraph (E) of this paragraph.</p>
                <p>(D) The county may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, subject to the priorities in subparagraph (C), except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the county until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded;</p>
                <p>(E) In order to perfect or bring an action to enforce or foreclose a tax lien under this paragraph, the county treasurer shall file a notice of the tax lien and a certified copy of the delinquent tax statement with the clerk and recorder of the real estate records in the county in which the mineral production occurred. A copy of the lien shall be filed with the secretary of state, but such filing is not required to perfect, enforce or foreclose the lien. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to require a county to perfect a lien that is perfected immediately under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. The notice of the tax lien shall contain:</p>
                <p>(I) The name and last known address of the person or persons against whose property the lien is filed including, but not limited to, the delinquent taxpayer;</p>
                <p>(II) The name and address of the county as the holder of the lien and the name of the contact person within the county;</p>
                <p>(III) The amount of the tax, fees, penalties and interest owed;</p>
                <p>(IV) A legal description of the premises of the mineral estate of the taxpayer from which the mineral was produced;</p>
                <p>(V) A statement that the amount of the unpaid tax, fees, penalties or interest is a lien on all property, real, tangible or intangible, including all after acquired property and rights to the property belonging to the delinquent taxpayer to the extent permitted by W.S. 39-14- 103(c)(i), 39-14-203(c)(i), 39-14-303(c)(i), 39-14-403(c)(i), 39-14-503(c)(i), 39-14-603(c)(i) and 39-14-703(c)(i) and located within the county, as well as all interest of the delinquent taxpayer in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and any future production from the same mineral leasehold regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral. Any new owner or new person extracting the mineral shall not be subject to a prior lien under this paragraph if the new owner or new person extracting the mineral furnishes evidence of a certification from the applicable taxing authorities to the previous owner or previous person extracting the mineral that at the time of the sale or transfer to the new owner or new person extracting the mineral, payment of all state and local taxes imposed upon mineral production was current or the applicable taxing authorities had released, settled or agreed to other payment terms.</p>
                <p>(F) No other action beyond that described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph shall be required to perfect or bring an action to enforce or foreclose a tax lien;</p>
                <p>(G) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>
                <p>(H) One (1) notice of the tax lien shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                <p>(J) Any tax lien created under this paragraph and duly filed shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the county;</p>
                <p>(K) In the event of foreclosure, the county shall be entitled to recover the costs of filing the lien, foreclosing on the lien and reasonable attorney's fees;</p>
                <p>(M) All notice of tax liens shall be released within sixty (60) days after taxes, penalties and interest due are paid or collected;</p>
                <p>(N) Notwithstanding that the lien is a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and on all future production from the same leasehold to the extent permitted by W.S. 39-14-103(c)(i), 39-14-203(c)(i), 39-14-303(c)(i), 39-14-403(c)(i), 39-14-503(c)(i), 39-14-603(c)(i) and 39-14-703(c)(i), the county may for good cause shown, release the lien on all property in the county, real, tangible and intangible, and settle delinquent taxes, interest and penalties to be collected against future production from that leasehold;</p>
                <p>(O) As used in this paragraph, "delinquent taxpayer" means any person who has any responsibility to pay ad valorem taxes, fees, penalties or interest on mineral production and who has not made full payment as of the date due for payment of the taxes, fees, penalties or interest. A delinquent taxpayer may include a mineral lessee who is receiving production from the mineral interest; the mineral lessor to the extent of the lessor's retained interest; an owner of a royalty, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate; or a person severing the mineral. "Delinquent taxpayer" shall not include an owner of a royalty interest, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate if the person who is producing the mineral withholds a portion of the royalty, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate for the purpose of remitting taxes, fees, penalties or interest on behalf of the owner.</p>
                <p>(vii) Liens on mineral production on or after January 1, 2021. The following shall apply:</p>
                <p>(A) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed upon mineral production under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the county in which the mineral was produced. The county lien is perpetual against all persons excluding the United States and the state of Wyoming and attaches and is perfected immediately upon production of the mineral. The lien is on all property in the county, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any taxpayer to the extent permitted by W.S. 39-14-103(c)(i), 39-14- 203(c)(i), 39-14-303(c)(i), 39-14-403(c)(i), 39-14-503(c)(i), 39-14-603(c)(i) and 39-14-703(c)(i);</p>
                <p>(B) A lien under this paragraph is also a lien on all interests of the taxpayer in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral. A lien under this paragraph shall not apply to a royalty interest, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate of an owner who is not a delinquent taxpayer;</p>
                <p>(C) A county lien arising under this paragraph is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except any superior lien existing before January 1, 2021 and the lien shall survive foreclosure actions until paid in full or until released by the lienholder. Any new owner or new person extracting the mineral shall not be subject to a prior lien under this paragraph if the new owner or new person extracting the mineral furnishes evidence of a certification from the applicable taxing authorities to the previous owner or previous person extracting the mineral that at the time of the sale or transfer to the new owner or new person extracting the mineral, payment of all state and local taxes imposed upon mineral production was current or the applicable taxing authorities had released, settled or agreed to other payment terms;</p>
                <p>(D) No lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the county until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to relieve any taxpayer of the requirement to pay any tax when due under this title;</p>
                <p>(E) In order to foreclose a tax lien under this paragraph pursuant to a tax sale under subsection (e) of this section, the county treasurer shall file a notice of the intent to foreclose and a certified copy of the delinquent tax statement with the clerk and recorder of the real estate records in the county in which the mineral production occurred. A copy of the intent to foreclose shall be provided to the person against whose property the lien is filed at the last known address of the person. The notice of the intent to foreclose shall contain:</p>
                <p>(I) The name and last known address of the person or persons against whose property the lien is filed including, but not limited to, the delinquent taxpayer;</p>
                <p>(II) The name and address of the county as the holder of the lien and the name of the contact person within the county;</p>
                <p>(III) The amount of the tax, fees, penalties and interest owed;</p>
                <p>(IV) A legal description of the premises of the mineral estate of the taxpayer from which the mineral was produced, detailed to at least the township, range and section.</p>
                <p>(F) No other action beyond that described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph shall be required to foreclose a tax lien;</p>
                <p>(G) One (1) notice of the intent to foreclose shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                <p>(H) Any tax lien created under this paragraph shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the county;</p>
                <p>(J) In the event of foreclosure, the county shall be entitled to recover the costs of filing the lien, foreclosing on the lien and reasonable attorney's fees;</p>
                <p>(K) A notice of intent to foreclose shall be released within sixty (60) days after taxes, penalties and interest due are paid or collected;</p>
                <p>(M) Notwithstanding that the lien is a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and on all future production from the same leasehold to the extent permitted by W.S. 39-14-103(c)(i), 39-14- 203(c)(i), 39-14-303(c)(i), 39-14-403(c)(i), 39-14-503(c)(i), 39-14-603(c)(i) and 39-14-703(c)(i), the county may, for good cause shown, release the lien on all property in the county, real, tangible and intangible, and settle delinquent taxes, interest and penalties to be collected against future production from that leasehold;</p>
                <p>(N) As used in this paragraph, "delinquent taxpayer" means any person who has any responsibility to pay ad valorem taxes, fees, penalties or interest on mineral production and who has not made full payment as of the date due for payment of the taxes, fees, penalties or interest. A delinquent taxpayer may include a mineral lessee who is receiving production from the mineral interest; the mineral lessor to the extent of the lessor's retained interest; an owner of a royalty, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate; or a person severing the mineral. "Delinquent taxpayer" shall not include an owner of a royalty interest, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate if the person who is producing the mineral withholds a portion of the royalty, overriding royalty or other interest carved out of the mineral estate for the purpose of remitting taxes, fees, penalties or interest on behalf of the owner.</p>
                <p>(e) Tax sales. The following shall apply:</p>

During a review, the county assessor shall disclose information sufficient to permit identification of the real estate parcels used by the county assessor in determining the value of the property at issue and provide the person or his agent papers of all information, including statements of consideration, the assessor relied upon in determining the property value and including statements of consideration for properties of like use and geographic area which were available to the assessor and are requested by the person or his agent. The county assessor shall, upon request, provide the person or his agent a statement indicating why a certain property was not used in determining the value of the property at issue. The county assessor and the contestant shall disclose those statements of consideration to the county board of equalization in conjunction with any hearing before the board with respect to the value or assessment of that property. As used in this paragraph:</p>
                <p>(A) A "review" is considered the initial meetings between the taxpayer and the county assessor's office pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) of this section;</p>

                <p>(i) Any person wishing to contest an assessment of his property shall file not later than thirty (30) days after the date of the assessment schedule properly sent pursuant to W.S. 39-13-103(b)(vii), a statement with the county assessor specifying the reasons why the assessment is incorrect.

The county assessor and the person contesting the assessment, or his agent, shall disclose witnesses and exchange information, evidence and documents relevant to the appeal, including sales information from relevant statements of consideration if requested, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled county board of equalization hearing. The assessor shall specifically identify the sales information used to determine market value of the property under appeal. A county board of equalization may receive evidence relative to any assessment and may require the person assessed or his agent or attorney to appear before it, be examined and produce any documents relating to the assessment. The appeal may be dismissed if any person willfully neglects or refuses to attend a meeting of a county board of equalization and be examined or answer any material question upon the board's request. The state board of equalization shall adopt rules to be followed by any county board of equalization when conducting appeals under this subsection. All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the rules adopted by the state board of equalization.

All deliberations of the board shall be in public. The county board of equalization may affirm the assessor's valuation or find in favor of the taxpayer and remand the case back to the assessor. The board shall make specific written findings and conclusions as to the evidence presented not later than October 1 of each year;</p>
                <p>(ii) A county assessor may appeal any decision or order of the county board of equalization to the state board of equalization;</p>
                <p>(iii) Any person aggrieved by any final administrative decision of the department may appeal to the board. Appeals shall be made in a timely manner as provided by rules and regulations of the board by filing with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. A complete record of the action from which the appeal is taken shall be transmitted to the board in a timely manner as specified by board rules and regulations;</p>
                <p>(iv) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the board, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated;</p>
                <p>(v) The board and department shall not compromise or reduce the tax liability of any person owing a tax to the state of Wyoming, except that the department for good cause, may, but is not required to, compromise and settle with the taxpayer for payment of any taxes owed to the state of Wyoming which tax liability is disputed in good faith by the taxpayer and which liability has not been settled in law. In case the department and the person owing the tax do not agree with respect to tax liability, the department shall by order, assess and levy the full amount of tax due and any person aggrieved by the assessment may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act;</p>
                <p>(vi) Repealed by Laws 2014, Ch. 106, § 2.</p>

                <p>(i) Within one (1) year following an illegal assessment, levy or collection of taxes an action may be filed in district court to enjoin the illegal assessment, levy or collection. The action shall be against the county assessor in the case of an illegal assessment, the governmental entity which levies an illegal levy, the county treasurer if the levy is entered on the tax list, or against the governmental entity if the taxes were collected and paid to the entity;</p>
                <p>(ii) If any person pays any tax, or portion thereof, found to have been erroneous or illegal, the board of county commissioners shall direct the county treasurer to refund the erroneous or illegal payment to the taxpayer. When an increase in the value of any product is subject to the approval of any agency of the United States of America or the state of Wyoming, or of any court, the increased value shall be subject to property taxation. In the event the increase in value is disapproved, either in whole or in part, then the amount of tax which has been paid on the disapproved part of the value shall be considered excess tax. Within one (1) year following the final determination of value, any person who has paid any such excess tax may apply for a refund, and the board of county commissioners shall refund the amount of excess tax paid. Any refund may, at the discretion of the board of county commissioners, be made in the form of credit against future tax payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Unless otherwise agreed to by the taxpayer, refunds in the form of credit against future tax payments shall be made in no less than equal annual amounts. The board of county commissioners shall not provide a credit for interest on the excess tax paid unless the taxes are paid under protest due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization and the taxpayer prevails in the appeal;</p>

Such gross income shall be verified by federal income tax returns which shall accompany the application for refund, if federal income tax returns were required and filed, or whatever other means necessary as determined by the department through rules and regulations. The tax refund for qualifying persons shall be in the form of a refund of any ad valorem tax due and timely paid upon the person's principal residence for the preceding calendar year in the amount specified in this paragraph. The department shall issue all refunds due under this paragraph on or before September 30 of the year in which application is made for the refund. Any person shall qualify for a refund in the amount specified under this paragraph if the person's gross income including the total household income of which the person is a member does not exceed the greater of three-fourths (3/4) of the median gross household income for the applicant's county of residence or the state, as determined annually by the economic analysis division of the department of administration and information. Additionally, no person shall qualify for a refund under this paragraph unless the person has total household assets as defined by the department of revenue through rules and regulations of not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) per adult member of the household as adjusted annually by the statewide average Wyoming cost-of-living index published by the economic analysis division of the department of administration and information, excluding the following:</p>

No more than one (1) home owner's tax credit shall be allowed on the same piece of property during any year;</p>
                <p>(B) A person who wishes to claim a home owner's tax credit shall file a claim under penalties of perjury with the county assessor on or before the fourth Monday in May on forms provided by the department of revenue. The forms may be mailed to property owners and may be published in a newspaper by county assessors and the mailed or published form may be filled out and returned by mail or in person to county assessors. The applicant shall list the property claimed to be subject to the tax credit, state that the property is the principal place of residence of the applicant and state that no other home owner's claims have been or will be submitted by the applicant during the remainder of the calendar year. False claims are punishable as provided by W.S. 6-5-303;</p>
                <p>(C) In completing the assessment roll of the county the county assessor shall indicate the assessed value used as a base for computation of the home owner's tax credit and the county treasurer shall collect from the property owner the amount of tax due minus the amount of tax credit allowed. On or before September 1, county assessors shall certify the credits granted pursuant to this section to the department. On or before October 1 the state treasurer out of funds appropriated for that purpose shall reimburse each county treasurer for the amount of taxes which would have been collected if the property tax credit had not been granted. The county treasurer shall distribute to each governmental entity the actual amount of revenue lost due to the tax credit;</p>
                <p>(D) The tax credit under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is one thousand four hundred sixty dollars ($1,460.00) times the mill levy to be applied against the property if the dwelling and land, not to exceed two (2) acres on which the dwelling is located, have a combined assessed value of less than three thousand nine hundred dollars ($3,900.00), or five hundred ninety dollars ($590.00) times the mill levy to be applied against the property if the dwelling and land, not to exceed two (2) acres on which the dwelling is located, have a combined assessed value of at least three thousand nine hundred dollars ($3,900.00) but less than five thousand eight hundred fifty dollars ($5,850.00) and if:</p>
                <p>(I) The dwelling and land on which the dwelling is located are owned by the same person or entity; and</p>
                <p>(II) The dwelling has been occupied in Wyoming since the beginning of the calendar year by the applicant.</p>
                <p>(E) The tax credit under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is five hundred ninety dollars ($590.00) times the mill levy to be applied against the property if:</p>
                <p>(I) The dwelling has an assessed value of less than five thousand eight hundred fifty dollars ($5,850.00); and</p>
                <p>(II) The land on which the dwelling is located is not owned by the same person or entity owning the dwelling; and</p>
                <p>(III) The dwelling has been occupied in Wyoming since the beginning of the calendar year by the applicant.</p>
                <p>(F) As used in this paragraph:</p>
                <p>(I) "Applicant" means:</p>

                <p>(II) "Dwelling" means a house, trailer house, mobile home, transportable home or other dwelling place.</p>
                <p>(G) Every person or entity holding an escrow for the payment of taxes on property owned by another shall notify the owner of the property of the amount of home owner's tax credit allowed to the owner under this paragraph annually on or before October 1;</p>
                <p>(H) The home owner's tax credit authorized by this paragraph is allowed during a fiscal year only if the legislature has appropriated monies that the department determines to be necessary to reimburse all local governments for tax losses created by this paragraph during that fiscal year. When it appears to the state treasurer that the monies appropriated are insufficient to reimburse the counties as provided herein, the money available shall be prorated among the counties at an amount less than one hundred percent (100%);</p>
                <p>(J) The purpose of this paragraph is to provide general property tax relief for certain persons who own their residences through a system of tax credits and general fund appropriations. The relief provided is to offset in part the general tax burden. Thus, the tax relief provided is determined by reference to property tax assessment and collection mechanisms but is not limited to property tax relief nor formulated upon legislative power to relieve such taxes. It is for the general relief of taxes and grounded upon general legislative power. In adopting this method of reimbursement of property taxes and providing that no local government shall incur any loss of property tax revenue under subparagraph (H) of this paragraph, any bond issues or other matters relying upon the assessed value of a local government for computation shall be predicated upon the assessed value of the local government before computation of tax credits under this paragraph.</p>

                <p>(i) Real property sold for delinquent taxes may be redeemed by the legal owner after the date of sale but before a valid tax deed application has been filed and accepted by the county treasurer pursuant to W.S. 39-13-108(e)(v)(A), by paying to the county treasurer to be held subject to order of the holder of the certificate of purchase, the amounts provided by paragraph (iv) or (v) of this subsection. The county treasurer, if satisfied the person has a right to redeem the property, shall issue to the legal owner or his assigns a certificate of redemption stating the facts of the sale substantially as contained in the certificate of purchase, the date of redemption, the amount paid and the name of the person redeeming the property. The county treasurer shall note the redemption in his records and notify the holder of the certificate of purchase;</p>
                <p>(ii) A mortgagee of real property, or a purchaser of real property at a mortgage foreclosure sale, shall have the right to partially redeem a certificate of purchase as to that portion of real property in which the mortgagee or purchaser holds an interest. The procedure for partial redemption of certificates of purchase shall be the same as provided in paragraph (i) of this subsection, except that the certificate of redemption shall state the appropriate facts of the partial redemption. A partial redemption under this subsection shall not affect the legal status of a certificate of purchase to the extent of any real property remaining unredeemed;</p>
                <p>(iii) An amount not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be collected by the county treasurer to be credited to the county treasury for the issuance of a certificate of redemption;</p>
                <p>(iv) A person redeeming real property from a person holding a certificate of purchase shall pay the following amounts, excluding attorney's fees, before being entitled to a certificate of redemption:</p>
                <p>(A) The amount for which the property was sold at the tax sale, or in the case of a partial redemption, the amount allocated by the county assessor to the portion being redeemed, including the charges provided by W.S. 39-13-108(e)(ix)(A) and (B) plus:</p>

                <p>(II) Interest at eight percent (8%) per annum since the date of sale except fifteen percent (15%) per annum on all property sold at date of 1982 tax sale and thereafter.</p>
                <p>(B) The amount of taxes accruing since the date of sale plus eight percent (8%) per annum if the subsequent taxes were paid by the holder of the certificate of purchase dated before 1982 tax sale. Commencing at date of 1982 tax sale, interest on subsequent taxes if paid by the holder of the certificate of purchase shall be fifteen percent (15%) per annum;</p>
                <p>(C) Actual expenses, not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) incurred by the holder of the certificate of purchase if redemption occurs after the holder has given notice of his intent to apply for a treasurer's deed, upon filing a sworn statement of the expense with the county treasurer.</p>
                <p>(v) A person redeeming real property from a county holding a certificate of purchase shall pay the amounts provided by subdivision (iv)(A)(II) and subparagraph (iv)(B) of this subsection before being entitled to a certificate of redemption.</p>
                <p>(f) Escrow. If taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the county treasurer shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in an interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution under W.S. 39-13-111 until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the county treasurer shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the county an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided under W.S. 39-13-111.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>39-13-113. Monthly payment of ad valorem tax on gross product of mineral production.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Commencing with mineral and mine production on January 1, 2020, this section shall govern the payment of all ad valorem taxes on the value of the gross product of minerals and mine products, hereafter referred to as the "ad valorem tax on mineral production". Any provisions of this title related to the ad valorem tax on mineral production that do not conform to the processes and procedures set forth in this section are superseded by this section to the extent the procedures conflict with this section.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as provided in this section, all mineral and mine producers in the state shall report and pay the ad valorem tax on mineral production for each county on a monthly basis. Payments shall be due and payable to the department on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Payments under this subsection shall not be less than the amount calculated by the taxpayer by applying the mill levy rate established by the county in the immediately preceding year to the value of the gross product of minerals and mine products produced each month. Annually, on or before September 20, the county treasurer shall send a written statement to each taxpayer by mail at his last known address or, if offered by the county and upon request of the taxpayer, by electronic transmission, of any tax due or overpayment received after applying the amount the county has received from that taxpayer through monthly payments under this section by reconciling those payments with the applicable mill levy rate for that production year, itemized as to property description, assessed value and applicable mill levies. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due. The taxpayer shall reconcile the amount indicated on the notice as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) If the statement provided by the county indicates additional taxes are due, the taxpayer shall pay the additional amount due not later than December 20 of that year;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the statement by the county indicates that the monthly payments resulted in an overpayment of the taxes, the county treasurer shall refund taxes that were overpaid under this section by December 20 of that year. The taxpayer may elect to have the county treasurer retain any overpayment amount and apply that amount towards other ad valorem taxes due.</p>
                <p>(c) Collection and distribution. Monthly and annual payments of the ad valorem tax on mineral production shall be collected by the department on behalf of each county. The department shall properly account for the payments received and distribute the payments promptly in the course of ordinary business to the county treasurer. Upon distribution of funds to counties under this subsection the amount shall be proportionally distributed by the county treasurer to each taxing entity within the county as provided in W.S. 39-13-111.</p>
                <p>(d) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax as imposed under chapter 14 of this title is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, the monthly payment requirements for the ad valorem tax on mineral production under this chapter are waived and the taxpayer shall report and pay the ad valorem tax on mineral production annually as provided in this subsection. The annual report and payment shall be due and payable on February 25 of the year following the year of production. Annual payments shall be calculated by the taxpayer by applying the mill levy rate established by the county commissioners in the production year, along with any adjustments made in accordance with law and reported by the county to the department by January 15 of the year following the production year, to the value of the gross product of minerals and mine products produced in the applicable year. Annual payments made under this subsection shall be paid to the department and deposited with the applicable county treasurer as provided in subsection (c) of this section and reconciled as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(e) Failure to make payments at the time they are due and payable under this section shall subject the taxpayer to the enforcement provisions of W.S. 39-13-108 and shall also be subject to enforcement as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) If the report and payment of tax required under this section is not provided, the department shall value the property from the best information available to determine the fair market value of the property;</p>
                <p>(ii) If a taxpayer producing valuable deposits fails to pay the taxes when due, the department shall file a notice of lien on behalf of the applicable county pursuant to W.S. 39-13- 108(d)(vi);</p>
                <p>(iii) Taxes due together with interest, penalties and costs shall be collectible by the department or county by appropriate judicial proceedings.</p>
                <p>(f) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of law, upon receiving an application from a taxpayer a county may enter into an agreement with the taxpayer to accept payments for the ad valorem tax on mineral production under the processes and procedures in place prior to the effective date of this section, subject to the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Prior to entering into any agreement under this subsection, the county shall:</p>
                <p>(A) Establish uniform eligibility criteria and an application process;</p>
                <p>(B) Conduct at least one (1) public meeting related to the proposed agreement. The county shall notify all taxing authorities that receive any taxes that may be impacted by the agreement of the meeting at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting.</p>
                <p>(ii) Upon entering into any agreement under this subsection, the county shall notify the department;</p>
                <p>(iii) Upon receipt of notice from a county under this subsection, the department shall exempt the taxpayer from the provisions of this section and the taxpayer shall be subject to all processes, procedures and requirements in place prior to the effective date of this section;</p>
                <p>(iv) No taxpayer shall be eligible for an agreement under this subsection for mineral production from any property acquired on or after the effective date of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is levied a severance tax on the value of the gross product for the privilege of severing or extracting both surface and underground coal in the state. The severance tax imposed by this article may be in addition to other taxes, including but not limited to the ad valorem taxes imposed by W.S. 39-13-104.</p>
                  <p>(b) Basis of tax (valuation). The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Coal shall be valued for taxation as provided in this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The value of the gross product shall be the fair market value of the product at the mouth of the mine where produced, after the mining or production process is completed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as otherwise provided, the mining or production process is deemed completed when the mineral product reaches the mouth of the mine. In no event shall the value of the mineral product include any processing functions or operations regardless of where the processing is performed;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as otherwise provided, if the product as defined in paragraph (iii) of this subsection is sold at the mouth of the mine, the fair market value shall be deemed to be the price established by bona fide arms-length sale;</p>
                  <p>(v) In the event the product as defined in paragraph</p>
                  <p>(iii) of this subsection is sold at the mouth of the mine without further movement or processing, the fair market value shall be the price established by bona fide arms-length sale less exempt royalties;</p>
                  <p>(vi) In the event the product as defined in paragraph</p>
                  <p>(iii) of this subsection is not sold at the mouth of the mine by bona fide arms-length sale, or, except as otherwise provided, if the product of the mine is used without sale, the department shall determine the fair market value of coal in accordance with paragraph (vii), (viii), (ix) or (x) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) For coal sold away from the mouth of the mine pursuant to a bona fide arms-length sale, the department shall calculate the fair market value of coal by multiplying the sales value of extracted coal, less transportation to market provided by a third party to the extent included in sales value, all royalties, ad valorem production taxes, severance taxes, black lung excise taxes and abandoned mine lands fees, by the ratio of direct mining costs to total direct costs. Nonexempt royalties, ad valorem production taxes, severance taxes, black lung excise taxes and abandoned mine lands fees shall then be added to determine fair market value. For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
                  <p>(A) The sales value of extracted coal shall be the selling price pursuant to an arms-length contract. To the extent not included in the selling price pursuant to an arms- length contract, and to the extent that the following represent partial consideration for the value of the coal, sales value shall include the value per ton attributable to the extracted coal for any consideration provided to the seller in the form of heat content adjustments, price escalations or de-escalations, expense reimbursements, capital, facilities or equipment, services for mining, handling, processing or transporting the coal at or near the mine site, or any payment received for the current or past sale of extracted coal, by or on behalf of the purchaser. Sales value per ton shall include consideration provided for the deferral of extraction and sale in the taxable period in which the purchaser receives credit for the payment as a result of subsequent extraction and sale of the deferred production;</p>
                  <p>(B) Direct mining costs include mining labor including mine foremen and supervisory personnel whose primary responsibility is extraction of coal, supplies used for mining, mining equipment depreciation, fuel, power and other utilities used for mining, maintenance of mining equipment, coal transportation from the point of severance to the mouth of the mine, and any other direct costs incurred prior to the mouth of the mine that are specifically attributable to the mining operation;</p>
                  <p>(C) Total direct costs include direct mining costs determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph plus mineral processing labor including plant foremen and supervisory personnel whose primary responsibility is processing coal, supplies used for processing, processing plant and equipment depreciation, fuel, power and other utilities used for processing, maintenance of processing equipment, coal transportation from the mouth of the mine to the point of shipment, coal transportation to market to the extent included in the price and provided by the producer, and any other direct costs incurred that are specifically attributable to the mining, processing or transportation of coal up to the point of loading for shipment to market;</p>
                  <p>(D) Indirect costs, royalties, ad valorem production taxes, severance taxes, black lung excise taxes and abandoned mine lands fees shall not be included in the computation of the ratio set forth in this paragraph. Indirect costs include but are not limited to allocations of corporate overhead, data processing costs, accounting, legal and clerical costs, and other general and administrative costs which cannot be specifically attributed to an operational function without allocation.</p>
                  <p>(viii) For coal used without sale, or coal not sold pursuant to a bona fide arms-length agreement, the sales value for the purposes of paragraph (vii) of this subsection shall be the fair market value of coal which is comparable in the quality, quantity, terms and conditions under which the coal is being used or sold, both in the spot market and through long- term agreements negotiated within the previous twelve (12) months, multiplied by the respective number of tons used or sold for each reporting period;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Notwithstanding paragraph (viii) of this subsection, the sales value for purposes of paragraph (vii) of this subsection for coal used as a feedstock in a coal enhancement process which has been subjected to normal processes necessary to achieve marketability, shall be the market value of comparable coal as determined by this paragraph. The market value of comparable coal attributable to feedstock coal shall be:</p>
                  <p>(A) A representative selling price received or receivable which shall be determined by the first of the following subdivisions that is applicable, multiplied by the total feedstock tons used in each reporting period:</p>
                  <p>(I) Arms-length price of comparable coal produced from the same mine and sold under comparable terms, or if a comparable coal price is not available from the same mine, the arms-length price of comparable coal produced from other mines in the area and sold under comparable terms;</p>
                  <p>(II) Price reported to a public utility commission for comparable coal produced from the same mine and sold under comparable terms, or if a comparable coal price is not available from the same mine, the price reported to a public utility commission for comparable coal produced from other mines in the area and sold under comparable terms;</p>
                  <p>(III) Other published or publicly available market prices for comparable coal produced from mines in the area and sold under comparable terms.</p>
                  <p>(B) If subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is not applicable, then the sales value for coal used as a feedstock shall be the total arms-length selling price of the enhanced coal sold during the reporting period multiplied by the total of the enhanced tons sold.</p>
                  <p>(x) In the event that unique or unusual circumstances exist such that the department or the taxpayer is unable to determine the value of the gross product of coal from a mine or mining claim by application of the methods provided in this subsection, the taxpayer may petition the department for approval to use an alternate valuation method. The department shall approve or deny the use of an alternate valuation method and shall so inform the parties within forty-five (45) days of the date the petition is filed.</p>
                  <p>(c) Taxpayer. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of the gross product of all mines and mining claims produced under lease, the lessor is liable for the payment of ad valorem taxes on the product removed only to the extent of the lessor's retained interest under the lease, whether royalty or otherwise, and the lessee or his assignee is liable for all other ad valorem taxes due on production under the lease;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any taxpayer paying the taxes imposed by this article on any valuable deposit may deduct the severance taxes paid from any amounts due or to become due to the interest owners of such valuable deposit in proportion to the interest ownership;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any person extracting valuable products subject to this chapter and any person owning an interest in the valuable products to the extent of their interest ownership are liable for the payment of the severance taxes imposed by this article together with any penalties and interest.</p>

                  <p>(a) Returns and reports. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before February 25 of the year following the year of production any person whose property is subject to W.S. 39-14-102(a) shall sign under oath and submit a statement listing the information relative to the property and affairs of the company as the department may require to assess the property:</p>
                  <p>(A) For mines and mining claims, the same date as prescribed by paragraph (iv) of this subsection for December production. In addition to the information required by this subsection, Wyoming coal producers shall provide to the department a summary of each new coal sales agreement for total sales in excess of ten thousand (10,000) tons and any amendment to an existing agreement for total sales in excess of ten thousand (10,000) tons signed during each calendar quarter no later than the last day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter. Each summary shall be on a form prescribed by the department and shall contain the date the agreement or amendment was executed, term of the agreement or amendment, annual volume or total volume if the agreement or amendment is for less than one (1) year, heat content requirements, quality specifications, nature and extent of enhancement if any, transportation terms, contract price and an explanation of any consideration that is a part of the sales value but not included in the contract price. A copy of each coal sales agreement or amendment shall be provided by the producer to the department no later than eighteen (18) months after the date the agreement or amendment was signed unless the agreement is not yet publicly available. If the agreement is not yet publicly available, the producer shall, in lieu of providing a copy of the agreement, notify the department in writing that the agreement is not yet publicly available and when the producer believes the agreement will be publicly available. It will thereafter be the responsibility of the producer to ascertain if and when the agreement does become publicly available and to provide a copy to the department within thirty (30) days from the date the agreement becomes publicly available. The producer may be relieved of the responsibility of ascertaining the date the agreement becomes publicly available by supplying a copy to the department. The coal sales agreements, amendments and summaries shall not be considered public records and shall not be open to public inspection. The coal sales agreements, amendments and summaries shall be considered taxpayer return information and shall be made available in accordance with applicable confidentiality statutes to the extent needed to carry out official duties under this section and W.S. 39-14-102(e) through (k). Proprietary information derived from the agreements and summaries shall be aggregated by the department on a calendar year basis prior to disclosure to any person not authorized by law to have access to the information. Any producer complying with this section shall not be required to provide subsequent summaries or copies of the same agreement or amendments to any of the agencies or officials identified by this section and W.S. 39-14-102(e) through (k). Any producer complying with this section shall not be required to provide other state agencies authorized by law to have access to the information, additional copies of sales agreements, amendments or summaries except as required through formal discovery in a contested case.</p>
                  <p>(ii) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For mines and mining claims, the department may presume that the property is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-103 shall report monthly to the department. The monthly tax reports are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Reports shall be filed on forms prescribed by the department. The department may allow extensions for filing returns by regulation;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly reporting requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall report annually. The annual report is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who reports and pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence reporting monthly as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly reporting requirements or from monthly to annual reporting;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For mines and mining claims, the taxpayer shall report the location of the production to the county and tax district in which the mine or mining claim is located, based upon the actual taxable production produced by the mine in each county or tax district. Other reasonable methods of reporting the location of production may be approved by the department upon written request of the taxpayer or taxing jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement in sealed envelopes of total tax due, itemized as to property description, assessed value and mill levies, to each taxpayer at his last known address. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ad valorem taxes provided by this act are due and payable:</p>
                  <p>(A) For the 2019 tax year and all preceding tax years, at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective January 1, 2020 for tax year 2020 and each year thereafter, ad valorem taxes are due as provided in W.S. 39-13-113.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for a severance tax under W.S. 39-14-103 shall pay monthly tax payments to the department. The payment shall be determined by the taxpayer based on the value of the gross product produced and saved during the second preceding month, and tax computed on value at rates prescribed in this chapter. The monthly tax payments are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly payment requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall pay the tax annually. The annual payment is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence remitting tax payments as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly payment requirements or from monthly to annual payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Timelines. Except as otherwise provided, there are no specific applicable provisions for timelines for this article.</p>

                  <p>(ii) When a taxpayer producing valuable deposits fails to pay the taxes imposed by this article when due, the purchaser of the produced valuable deposit shall withhold and remit to the department the taxpayer's subsequently accruing taxes on the produced valuable deposit acquired by the purchaser.

                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 84, § 102.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to certify mine product valuation amendments to the county assessor of the county in which the property is located, to be entered upon the assessment rolls of the county and taxes computed and collected thereon subject to appeal under W.S. 39-14-109(b)(ii), provided that the return is filed within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-107(a)(i), and that the audit or review commenced within the time period as required by paragraph (vii) of this subsection. Commencement of an audit, completion of an audit, and final audit findings and final determination by the department being issued to the taxpayer shall not preclude the taxpayer from filing amended returns within the time period specified herein, and the amended returns may be audited within the time period stated in paragraph (vii) of this subsection;</p>

                  <p>(v) All audits or department reviews, as applicable, pursuant to paragraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this subsection are subject to the following conditions:</p>

If the examination discloses evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer in reporting and paying the tax, the department may examine all pertinent records for any reporting period without regard to the limitations set forth in paragraphs</p>
                  <p>(vii) and (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to examine relevant books or records of a taxpayer subject to a tax imposed by this article or to secure any information related to enforcement of this article, authorized representatives of the department may at any time during normal business hours enter premises of a taxpayer liable for a tax imposed by this article or the premises of any third party having information regarding that taxpayer's liability. Prior to entering the premises of a taxpayer or third party, the department shall provide fourteen (14) days written notice to the taxpayer and third party;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The state may employ auditors and obtain other technical assistance necessary to determine if the tax imposed by this article has been properly reported and paid.</p>
                  <p>(c) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating interest regarding severance tax, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. In calculating interest regarding ad valorem tax, the county treasurer shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. The board of county commissioners shall be bound by any decision made by the department of revenue in the course of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section concerning the time period during which interest shall accrue and be due and payable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Taxes are delinquent pursuant to paragraphs</p>
                  <p>(iii) and (iv) of this subsection when a taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the total tax liability was not paid when due;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except for any delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-107(b)(ii) is delinquent after the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Effective January 15, 2015, for delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-107(b) shall be delinquent following the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (iv) of this subsection until paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Effective January 1, 2015, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to all delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section on any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be less than twelve percent (12%) nor greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. The interest rate on any delinquent severance and ad valorem tax from any mineral produced before January 1, 2015, shall be as provided by the statutes in effect at the time the mineral was produced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating penalty, the department or board of county commissioners shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any penalty due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails to file the report required by W.S. 39-14-107(a)(i)(A) by the due date or any extension thereof, the department may impose a penalty equal to a total of one percent (1%) of the taxable value of the production from the well, mine or mining claim but not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof that the report or information is late. If any person fails to file reports and other information required by rule of the department of revenue other than those required by W.S. 39-14-107(a)(iv) or 39-14-107(a)(i)(A), the department may impose a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The department may waive penalties under this paragraph for good cause. Penalties imposed under this paragraph may be appealed to the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person fails to make or file a return and remit the tax as required by W.S. 39-14-107, the department shall impose a penalty of five percent (5%) of the taxes due for each thirty (30) day period, or fraction thereof, elapsing between the due date of the return and the date filed, unless the person for good cause obtains from the department an extension of time for filing prior to the due date for filing. In no event shall the total penalty imposed by this subsection exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return for any one (1) month in a calendar year, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The return was filed within five (5) business days following the due date, including an approved extension period; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within fifteen (15) days after the return was filed, setting forth the reasons for the late filing.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If any part of a tax deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, there shall be added a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of the deficiency plus interest as provided by paragraph (c)(iv) of this subsection. The taxes, penalty and interest shall be paid by the taxpayer within ten (10) days after receipt of notice and demand by the department;</p>
                  <p>(v) The department may credit or waive penalties imposed by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(e) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed by Laws 2002, Ch. 50, § 2.</p>

                  <p>(iv) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the state of Wyoming. The lien is on all property in the state of Wyoming, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any person severing minerals in this state and who is liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of the severance tax and corresponding penalty or interest as of the date such taxes, fees, penalties or interest is due, and remains a lien until paid;</p>
                  <p>(v) A lien under this subsection is also a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any lien arising under this subsection is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The department may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the department until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to perfect a tax lien under this subsection, the department of revenue shall file a notice of the tax lien with the secretary of state. The notice of the tax lien shall contain:</p>

                  <p>(D) A statement that the amount of the unpaid tax, fees, penalties or interest is a lien on all property, real, tangible or intangible, including all after acquired property and rights to the property belonging to the person who severed the mineral and located within the state of Wyoming, as well as all interest in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and any future production from the same mineral leasehold.</p>
                  <p>(ix) No other action beyond that described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall be required to perfect a tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(x) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(xi) One (1) notice of the tax lien shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any tax lien created under this subsection and duly filed with the secretary of state shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the state;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>39-14-109. Taxpayer remedies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Interpretation requests. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer may request a value determination from the department and propose a value determination method which may be used until the department issues a value determination. The taxpayer shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal and any additional information the department deems necessary. After the department issues its determination, the taxpayer shall make adjustments based upon the value established or request a hearing by the board;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A taxpayer may request and the department shall provide written interpretations of these statutes and rules. When requesting an interpretation, a taxpayer must set forth the facts and circumstances pertinent to the issue. If the department deems the facts and circumstances provided to be insufficient, it may request additional information. A taxpayer may act in reliance upon a written interpretation through the end of the calendar year in which the interpretation was issued, or until revoked by the department, whichever occurs last if the pertinent facts and circumstances were substantially correct and fully disclosed.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Following determination of the fair market value of property the department shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the assessed value. The person assessed may file written objections to the assessment with the board within thirty (30) days of the date of postmark and appear before the board at a time specified by the board. The person assessed shall also file a copy of the written objections with the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located, who shall notify the county assessor and the board of county commissioners, with an estimate of the tax amount under appeal based upon the previous year's tax levy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Mine product valuation amendments under this section may be appealed by the taxpayer to the board within thirty (30) days of the final administrative decision;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any taxpayer who feels aggrieved by the valuation and taxes levied by this article may appeal to the board. The appeal does not relieve the taxpayer from paying the tax when due and payable nor does the payment invalidate the appeal. No restraining order or injunction shall be granted or issued by any court or judge to restrain or enjoin the collection of any tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The state board of equalization shall perform the duties specified in article 15, section 10 of the Wyoming constitution and shall hear appeals from county boards of equalization and review final decisions of the department upon application of any interested person adversely affected, including boards of county commissioners for the purposes of this paragraph, under the contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the board;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the board, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.</p>

Any refund granted shall be subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a taxpayer has reason to believe that taxes imposed by this article have been overpaid, a request for refund shall be filed with the department by submitting an amended return within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-107(a)(i). Refunds of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), or less may be applied to subsequent payments for taxes imposed by this article. Requests for refunds exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) shall be approved in writing by the department prior to the taxpayer receiving credit. All refunds granted are subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, the taxpayer is entitled to receive a refund of any overpaid ad valorem or severance tax identified by an audit regardless of whether a refund has been requested.</p>
                  <p>(d) Credits. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any refund may, at the discretion of the board of county commissioners, be made in the form of credit against future tax payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Unless otherwise agreed to by the taxpayer, refunds in the form of credit against future tax payments shall be made in no less than equal annual amounts. The board of county commissioners shall not provide a credit for interest on the excess tax paid unless the taxes are paid under protest due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization and the taxpayer prevails in the appeal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If a taxpayer overpaid taxes imposed by this article, the department shall allow a credit in the amount of the overpayment to be taken on the taxpayer's subsequent monthly reports for the production year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) Escrow. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If ad valorem taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the county treasurer shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in an interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the county treasurer shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the county an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If severance taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the department shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in a separate interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered by the state board of equalization or the court. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the department shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the state an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) This provision does not enlarge or curtail the ability of a taxpayer to appeal any department of revenue decision as otherwise provided for under this act.</p>

The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(A) The capitalization rate is any rate used to convert an income stream into a present worth of future benefits. The rate reflects the relationship between one (1) year's income or an annual average of several years' income and the corresponding value. The department shall annually calculate the capitalization rate based upon the band of investment method as defined by this paragraph.

                  <p>(B) "Band of investment method" means that the capitalization rate is equal to the weighted average cost of the debt and equity portions of the capital investment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(I) Proper development and application of the band of investment shall require obtaining and analyzing data for the percent of debt and equity which makes up the capital structure as determined from published financial sources such as Moody's bond record, Moody's bond survey, Value Line, Moody's public utility or transportation manuals, regulatory reports or other recognized financial materials. The determination shall be done by the corporate bonds' rating of the representative companies or other means if bond ratings are not available;</p>
                  <p>(II) Debt rate estimates used in the band of investment method shall reflect the average current cost of yield to maturity of outstanding issues of debt financing for the year ending closest to the date of the calculation of the capitalization rate required by this paragraph. The rates shall be taken from published financial sources such as Moody's public utility news reports or other recognized financial materials. The determination shall be done by corporate bond rating of the representative companies;</p>
                  <p>(III) Preferred rate estimates used in the band of investment method shall reflect the average current cost of market yield of outstanding issues of preferred stock financing for the year ending closest to the date of the calculation of the capitalization rate required by this paragraph. The rates shall be taken from published financial sources such as Moody's public utility news reports or other recognized financial materials. The determination shall be done by corporate bond rating of the representative companies;</p>
                  <p>(IV) The current cost of equity shall be based on data from the capital markets of the representative companies. Equity rates shall reflect the representative cost of equity financing for the representative companies by corporate bond rating as of the date of the calculation of the capitalization rate under this paragraph. The current cost of equity shall be developed by accepted models in the appraisal and financial communities. These models shall include, but are not limited to, equity risk premium, capital asset pricing model and the discounted cash flow model. The sources of required data shall be taken from published financial sources such as Value Line, Ibbotson Associates, Wall Street Journal, regulatory filings and other recognized financial materials. Not later than March 15 of each year, the department shall conduct a public meeting for presentation of the capitalization rate to be used to value production in the same calendar year in which the rate is determined. Notice of the date and time of the meeting shall be provided to all interested parties at least thirty (30) days prior to the meeting. Interested parties may present written or oral comments on the proposed capitalization rate or within five (5) business days thereafter. A final determination of the capitalization rate shall be made available on or before March 31 or as soon thereafter as possible;</p>
                  <p>(V) Within thirty (30) days of the final capitalization rate determination under this paragraph, the taxpayer shall file amended returns and remit any severance tax due for that portion of the year for which the capitalization rate had yet to be determined and no interest or penalty shall be due as a result of the application of the new capitalization rate.</p>
                  <p>(xxxiv) For the purposes of W.S. 39-14-203(b)(vi)(E), "return on investment" means the product of the rate of return multiplied by the gross capital investment in all processing and transportation facilities used by the taxpayer to process or transport natural gas from the point of valuation to the point of arms-length sale as maintained on the taxpayer's books and records under generally accepted accounting principles;</p>
                  <p>(xxxv) For the purposes of W.S. 39-14-203(b)(vi)(E), "total direct processing and transportation costs" means all costs incurred by the taxpayer to operate all processing or transportation facilities from the point of valuation to the point of arms-length sale as maintained on the taxpayer's books and records. The costs shall include salaries and benefits; contract labor; repairs and maintenance including processing facility turnarounds; fuel, power and utilities; chemicals; processing facility premise lease costs to nonaffiliated parties; waste water treatment; disposal of byproduct and waste products; safety; costs of environmental permitting and monitoring, federal and state environmental compliance fees and costs, excluding compensatory and punitive damages and governmental penalties; laboratory; distributive control system; and ad valorem taxes on real and tangible personal property excluding the gross products tax. The taxpayer shall be entitled to its proportionate share of the total direct processing and transportation costs as measured by its percentage of inlet volumes;</p>
                  <p>(xxxvi) For the purposes of paragraph (xxxiv) of this subsection, "gross capital investment" means the total gross capitalized investment in the processing and transportation facilities from the point of valuation to the point of arms- length sale as maintained on the taxpayer's books and records under generally accepted accounting principles.

                  <p><shortTitle>39-14-203. Imposition.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is levied a severance tax on the value of the gross product extracted for the privilege of severing or extracting crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas in the state. The tax imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to all other taxes imposed by law including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes imposed by W.S. 39-13-101 through 39-13-111.</p>
                  <p>(b) Basis of tax. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Crude oil, lease condensate and natural gas shall be valued for taxation as provided in this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The fair market value for crude oil, lease condensate and natural gas shall be determined after the production process is completed. Notwithstanding paragraph (x) of this subsection, expenses incurred by the producer prior to the point of valuation are not deductible in determining the fair market value of the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The production process for crude oil or lease condensate is completed after extracting from the well, gathering, heating and treating, separating, injecting for enhanced recovery, and any other activity which occurs before the outlet of the initial storage facility or lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) unit;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The production process for natural gas is completed after extracting from the well, gathering, separating, injecting and any other activity which occurs before the outlet of the initial dehydrator. When no dehydration is performed, other than within a processing facility, the production process is completed at the inlet to the initial transportation related compressor, custody transfer meter or processing facility, whichever occurs first;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production as provided by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection are sold to a third party, or processed or transported by a third party at or prior to the point of valuation provided in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection, the fair market value shall be the value established by bona fide arms-length transaction;</p>
                  <p>(vi) In the event the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production as provided by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection is not sold at or prior to the point of valuation by bona fide arms-length sale, or, except as otherwise provided, if the production is used without sale, the department shall identify the method it intends to apply under this paragraph to determine the fair market value and notify the taxpayer of that method on or before September 1 of the year preceding the year for which the method shall be employed. The department shall determine the fair market value by application of one (1) of the following methods:</p>
                  <p>(A) Comparable sales-The fair market value is the representative arms-length market price for minerals of like quality and quantity used or sold at the point of valuation provided in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection taking into consideration the location, terms and conditions under which the minerals are being used or sold;</p>
                  <p>(B) Comparable value-The fair market value is the arms-length sales price less processing and transportation fees charged to other parties for minerals of like quantity, taking into consideration the quality, terms and conditions under which the minerals are being processed or transported;</p>
                  <p>(C) Netback-The fair market value is the sales price minus expenses incurred by the producer for transporting produced minerals to the point of sale and third party processing fees. The netback method shall not be utilized in determining the taxable value of natural gas which is processed by the producer of the natural gas;</p>
                  <p>(D) Proportionate profits - The proportionate profits method shall only be used as a method in conjunction with the provisions of the modified netback method in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. The fair market value is:</p>
                  <p>(I) The total amount received from the sale of the minerals minus exempt royalties, nonexempt royalties and production taxes times the quotient of the direct cost of producing the minerals divided by the direct cost of producing, processing and transporting the minerals; plus</p>
                  <p>(II) Nonexempt royalties and production taxes.</p>
                  <p>(E) Modified netback - The fair market value is:</p>
                  <p>(I) The total amount received from the sale of the natural gas minus the total direct processing and transportation costs, any arms-length transportation fees from the point of valuation to the point of arms-length sale, overhead costs directly related to facility operations not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the total direct processing and transportation costs, exempt royalties and return on investment incurred by the taxpayer from the point of valuation to the point of arms-length sale;</p>
                  <p>(II) There shall be one (1) point of valuation for all interest owners of the processing facility;</p>
                  <p>(III) Any producer utilizing the modified netback method set forth in this subparagraph shall be required to calculate the taxable value for the tax year under the methods of both this subparagraph and subparagraph (D) of this paragraph (hereafter referred to as the "annual floor test"). The taxable value for the year shall be the higher of the two (2) taxable values determined under the annual floor test. If the valuation method is changed as a result of the provision in this subparagraph, no interest or penalties shall be due if the taxpayer files the amended returns and remits the additional severance tax due under this subparagraph not later than May 25 of that calendar year. After the first year of applicability of this subparagraph, for each succeeding year the taxpayer's monthly severance tax returns shall be filed using the valuation method determined under the annual floor test for the immediately preceding calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(vii) When the taxpayer and department jointly agree, that the application of one (1) of the methods listed in paragraph (vi) of this subsection does not produce a representative fair market value for the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production, a mutually acceptable alternative method may be applied;</p>
                  <p>(viii) If the fair market value of the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production as provided by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection is determined pursuant to paragraph (vi) of this subsection, the method employed shall be used in computing taxes for three (3) years including the year in which it is first applied or until changed by mutual agreement between the department and taxpayer. If the taxpayer believes the valuation method selected by the department does not accurately reflect the fair market value of the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas, the taxpayer may appeal to the board of equalization for a change of methods within one (1) year from the date the department notified the taxpayer of the method selected;</p>
                  <p>(ix) If the department fails to notify the taxpayer of the method selected pursuant to paragraph (vi) of this subsection, the taxpayer shall select a method and inform the department. The method selected by the taxpayer shall be used in computing taxes for three (3) years including the year in which it is first applied or until changed by mutual agreement between the taxpayer and the department. If the department believes the valuation technique selected by the taxpayer does not accurately reflect the fair market value of the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas, the department may appeal to the board of equalization for a change of methods within one (1) year from the date the taxpayer notified the department of the method selected;</p>
                  <p>(x) If crude oil is enhanced prior to the point of valuation as defined in paragraph (iii) of this subsection by either a blending process with a higher grade hydrocarbon or through a refining process such as cracking, then the fair market value shall be the fair market value of the crude oil absent the blending or refining process;</p>
                  <p>(xi) For natural gas, the total of all actual transportation costs from the point where the production process is completed to the inlet of the processing facility or main transmission line shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the value of the gross product without approval of the department based on documentation that the costs are due to environmental, public health or safety considerations, or other unusual circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(c) Taxpayer. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of ad valorem taxes on crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas produced under lease, the lessor is liable for the payment of ad valorem taxes on crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production removed only to the extent of the lessor's retained interest under the lease, whether royalty or otherwise, and the lessee or his assignee is liable for all other ad valorem taxes due on production under the lease;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of severance taxes, any person extracting crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas and any person owning an interest in the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production to the extent of their interest ownership are liable for the payment of the severance taxes together with any penalties and interest;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any taxpayer paying severance taxes on any crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production may deduct the taxes paid from any amounts due or to become due to the interest owners of such production in proportion to the interest ownership.</p>

Subject to subsection (o) of this section, the exemption under this subsection shall not apply to natural gas production when the twelve (12) month rolling average of the Henry hub spot price for natural gas is two dollars and ninety-five cents ($2.95) or more per thousand cubic feet at the time of first production from the well and shall not apply to the production of crude oil when the twelve (12) month rolling average of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot price of sweet crude oil is fifty dollars ($50.00) or more per barrel at the time of first production from the well. If the exemption under this subsection is applicable to a new well based upon the oil or gas price at the time of first production, the exemption shall be an exemption of the full two percent (2%) tax rate under W.S. 39- 14-204(a)(iv) for the first six (6) months of production and shall reduce the rate under W.S. 39-14-204(a)(iv) to one percent (1%) for the next six (6) months of production.</p>
                  <p>(o) In determining the exemption under subsection (n) of this section, the department shall use the twelve (12) month rolling average based on the monthly average of daily spot prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) per barrel of oil and the monthly average of daily spot prices for Henry hub per thousand cubic feet of natural gas for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding first production from the well. The department shall post the most recent monthly average and the twelve (12) month rolling average for the calculated prices on its website. Not later than November 1 of each year, the department shall report to the joint revenue interim committee on the use of the exemptions under subsection (n) of this section, and associated revenue impacts.</p>

                  <p>(a) Returns and reports. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before February 25 of the year following the year of production any person whose crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production is subject to W.S. 39-14-202(a) shall sign under oath and submit a statement listing the information relative to the production and affairs of the company as the department may require to assess the production;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas, the taxpayer shall report the location of the production to the county and tax district in which the well or property is located, based upon the actual taxable production produced by the well or property in each county or tax district. Other reasonable methods of reporting the location of production may be approved by the department upon written request of the taxpayer or taxing jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas, the department may presume that the production is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer pursuant to paragraph (iii) of this subsection. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                  <p>(v) Except as provided in paragraph (vi) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-203(a) shall report monthly to the department. The monthly tax reports are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Reports shall be filed on forms prescribed by the department. The department may allow extensions for filing returns by regulation;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If a taxpayer's liability for severance taxes is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly reporting requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall report annually. The annual report is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who reports annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence reporting monthly as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly reporting requirements or from monthly to annual reporting.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement in sealed envelopes of total ad valorem tax due, itemized as to production description, assessed value and mill levies, to each taxpayer at his last known address. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ad valorem taxes are due and payable:</p>
                  <p>(A) For the 2019 tax year and all preceding tax years, at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective January 1, 2020 for tax year 2020 and each year thereafter, ad valorem taxes are due as provided in W.S. 39-13-113.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-203(a) shall pay monthly tax payments to the department. The payment shall be determined by the taxpayer based on the value of the gross product of the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas produced and saved during the second preceding month, and tax computed on value at rates prescribed by W.S. 39-14-204(a). The monthly tax payments are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer's liability for severance taxes is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly payment requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall pay the tax annually. The annual report and payment are due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence remitting tax payments as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly payment requirements or from monthly to annual payment.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 84, § 102.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to certify mine product valuation amendments to the county assessor of the county from which the crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas was produced, to be entered upon the assessment rolls of the county and taxes computed and collected thereon subject to appeal under W.S. 39-14-209(b)(v), provided that the return is filed within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-207(a)(i), and that the audit or review commenced within the time period as required by paragraph (vii) of this subsection. Commencement of an audit, completion of an audit, and final audit findings and final determination by the department being issued to the taxpayer shall not preclude the taxpayer from filing amended returns within the time period specified herein, and the amended returns may be audited within the time period stated in paragraph (vii) of this subsection;</p>

                  <p>(D) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, audits shall be completed and the final audit findings issued to the taxpayer not later than the end of the month two (2) years after the audit is commenced and not sooner than one (1) year following the reporting date for ad valorem taxes;</p>
                  <p>(E) Any assessment or levy, including the assessment of a penalty and interest, if any, resulting from final audit findings or department review shall be issued within one (1) year following the completion of the audit or review;</p>
                  <p>(F) Upon receipt of department review findings, the taxpayer shall have sixty (60) days in which to submit a response.</p>
                  <p>(vi) Where there is evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer in reporting and valuing production, an audit may examine prior years and issue assessments where gross negligence occurred. This subsection shall not apply to mine product valuation amendments to add the value of unreported production;</p>

Amended returns filed with the department during the conduct of an audit prior to the issuance of the final audit findings may be made available by the taxpayer to the audit examiners. If the examination discloses evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer in reporting and paying the tax, the department may examine all pertinent records for any reporting period without regard to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (vii) and (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to examine relevant books or records of a taxpayer subject to severance taxes imposed by this article or to secure any information related to enforcement of this article, authorized representatives of the department may at any time during normal business hours enter premises of a taxpayer liable for a severance tax imposed by this article or the premises of any third party having information regarding that taxpayer's liability. Prior to entering the premises of a taxpayer or third party, the department shall provide fourteen (14) days written notice to the taxpayer and third party;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The state may employ auditors and obtain other technical assistance necessary to determine if the severance tax imposed by this article has been properly reported and paid;</p>

                  <p>(c) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating interest regarding severance tax, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. In calculating interest regarding ad valorem tax, the county treasurer shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. The board of county commissioners shall be bound by any decision made by the department of revenue in the course of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section concerning the time period during which interest shall accrue and be due and payable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Taxes are delinquent pursuant to paragraphs</p>
                  <p>(iii) and (iv) of this subsection when a taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the total tax liability was not paid when due;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except for any delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-207(b)(ii) is delinquent after the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Effective January 15, 2015, for delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-207(b) shall be delinquent following the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (iv) of this subsection until paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Effective January 1, 2015, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to all delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section on any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent severance and ad valorem taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be less than twelve percent (12%) nor greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. The interest rate on any delinquent crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas severance and ad valorem tax from any crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas produced before January 1, 2015, shall be as provided by the statutes in effect at the time the mineral was produced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating penalty, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any penalty due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails to file the ad valorem report required by W.S. 39-14-207(a)(i) by the due date or any extension thereof, the department may impose a penalty equal to a total of one percent (1%) of the taxable value of the production from the well or property but not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof that the report or information is late. If any person fails to file reports and other information required by rule of the department of revenue other than those required by W.S. 39-14-207(a)(v) or 39-14-207(a)(i) the department may impose a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The department may waive penalties under this subsection for good cause. Penalties imposed under this subsection may be appealed to the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person fails to make or file a severance tax return and remit the tax as required by W.S. 39-14-207(a)(v) and (b)(iii), the department shall impose a penalty of five percent (5%) of the taxes due for each thirty (30) day period, or fraction thereof, elapsing between the due date of the return and the date filed, unless the person for good cause obtains from the department an extension of time for filing prior to the due date for filing. In no event shall the total penalty imposed by this subsection exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return for any one (1) month in a calendar year, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The return was filed within five (5) business days following the due date, including an approved extension period; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within fifteen (15) days after the return was filed, setting forth the reasons for the late filing.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If any part of a severance tax deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, there shall be added a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of the deficiency plus interest as provided by W.S. 39-14-208(c)(iv). The taxes, penalty and interest shall be paid by the taxpayer within ten (10) days after receipt of notice and demand by the department;</p>
                  <p>(v) The department may credit or waive penalties imposed by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(e) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>

                  <p>(iv) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the state of Wyoming. The lien is on all property in the state of Wyoming, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any person severing minerals in this state and who is liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of the severance tax and corresponding penalty or interest as of the date such taxes, fees, penalties or interest is due, and remains a lien until paid;</p>
                  <p>(v) A lien under this subsection is also a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any lien arising under this subsection is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The department may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the department until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to perfect a tax lien under this subsection, the department of revenue shall file a notice of the tax lien with the secretary of state. The notice of the tax lien shall contain:</p>

                  <p>(B) The name and address of the department of revenue as the holder of the lien and the name of the contact person within the department;</p>
                  <p>(C) The amount of the tax, fees, penalties and interest owed the state of Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(D) A statement that the amount of the unpaid tax, fees, penalties or interest is a lien on all property, real, tangible or intangible, including all after acquired property and rights to the property belonging to the person who severed the mineral and located within the state of Wyoming, as well as all interest in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and any future production from the same mineral leasehold.</p>
                  <p>(ix) No other action beyond that described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall be required to perfect a tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(x) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(xi) One (1) notice of the tax lien shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any tax lien created under this subsection and duly filed with the secretary of state shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the state;</p>

                  <p>(xiv) All notice of tax liens shall be released within sixty (60) days after taxes, penalties and interest due are paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(xv) Notwithstanding that the lien is a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and on all future production from the same leasehold, the department may for good cause shown, release the lien on all property in this state, real, tangible and intangible, and settle delinquent taxes, interest and penalties to be collected against future production from that leasehold;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) The secretary of state is authorized and directed to maintain copies of all tax liens filed by the department of revenue pursuant to this chapter, and to maintain a data base of such tax liens and to provide copies to any person pursuant to the duties of the secretary of state as set forth in W.S. 9-1-301 et seq. All tax liens on file with any county in this state and in good standing on the effective date of this paragraph shall remain effective and in good standing. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this paragraph, the director of the department of revenue shall transmit to the secretary of state for filing copies of all tax liens that the director seeks to have in continuing effect. Upon the filing of a copy of the tax lien with the secretary of state, the tax lien shall continue to be fully effective until released by the department of revenue.</p>

                  <p>(a) Interpretation requests. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer may request a value determination from the department and propose a value determination method which may be used until the department issues a value determination. The taxpayer shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal and any additional information the department deems necessary. After the department issues its determination, the taxpayer shall make adjustments based upon the value established or request a hearing by the board;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A taxpayer may request and the department shall provide written interpretations of these statutes and rules. When requesting an interpretation, a taxpayer must set forth the facts and circumstances pertinent to the issue. If the department deems the facts and circumstances provided to be insufficient, it may request additional information. A taxpayer may act in reliance upon a written interpretation through the end of the calendar year in which the interpretation was issued, or until revoked by the department, whichever occurs last if the pertinent facts and circumstances were substantially correct and fully disclosed.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any person aggrieved by any final administrative decision of the department may appeal to the state board of equalization. Appeals shall be made in a timely manner as provided by rules and regulations of the board by filing with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. The department shall, within a timely manner as specified by board rules and regulations, transmit to the board the complete record of the action from which the appeal is taken;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the state board of equalization, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the production or some part thereof is situated;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Following determination of the fair market value of crude oil, lease condensate or natural gas production the department shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the assessed value. The person assessed may file written objections to the assessment with the state board of equalization within thirty (30) days of the date of postmark and appear before the board at a time specified by the board. The person assessed shall also file a copy of the written objections with the county treasurer of the county in which the production is located, who shall notify the county assessor and the board of county commissioners, with an estimate of the tax amount under appeal based upon the previous year's tax levy;</p>
                  <p>(v) Mine product valuation amendments may be appealed by the taxpayer to the state board of equalization within thirty (30) days of the final administrative decision;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any taxpayer who feels aggrieved by the valuation and severance taxes levied by this article may appeal to the state board of equalization. The appeal does not relieve the taxpayer from paying the tax when due and payable nor does the payment invalidate the appeal. No restraining order or injunction shall be granted or issued by any court or judge to restrain or enjoin the collection of any severance tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) Refunds. The following shall apply:</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>39-14-307. Compliance; collection procedures.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Returns, reports. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before February 25 of the year following the year of production any person whose property is subject to W.S. 39-14-302(a) shall sign under oath and submit a statement listing the information relative to the property and affairs of the company as the department may require to assess the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For mines and mining claims, the department may presume that the property is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-303 shall report monthly to the department. The monthly tax reports are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Reports shall be filed on forms prescribed by the department. The department may allow extensions for filing returns by regulation;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly reporting requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall report annually. The annual report is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who reports annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence reporting monthly as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly reporting requirements or from monthly to annual reporting;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For mines and mining claims, the taxpayer shall report the location of the production to the county and tax district in which the mine or mining claim is located, based upon the actual taxable production produced by the mine in each county or tax district. Other reasonable methods of reporting the location of production may be approved by the department upon written request of the taxpayer or taxing jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement in sealed envelopes of total tax due, itemized as to property description, assessed value and mill levies, to each taxpayer at his last known address. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ad valorem taxes provided by this act are due and payable:</p>
                  <p>(A) For the 2019 tax year and all preceding tax years, at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective January 1, 2020 for tax year 2020 and each year thereafter, ad valorem taxes are due as provided in W.S. 39-13-113.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for a severance tax under W.S. 39-14-303(a) shall pay monthly tax payments to the department. The payment shall be determined by the taxpayer based on the value of the gross product produced and saved during the second preceding month, and tax computed on value at rates prescribed in this article. The monthly tax payments are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly payment requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall pay the tax annually. The annual payment is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence remitting tax payments as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly payment requirements or from monthly to annual payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Timelines. Except as otherwise specifically provided, there are no general applicable provisions for timelines for this article.</p>

                  <p>(iii) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to certify mine product valuation amendments to the county assessor of the county in which the property is located, to be entered upon the assessment rolls of the county and taxes computed and collected thereon subject to appeal under W.S. 39-14-309(b)(ii), provided that the return is filed within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-307(a)(i), and that the audit or review commenced within the time period as required by paragraph (vii) of this subsection. Commencement of an audit, completion of an audit, and final audit findings and final determination by the department being issued to the taxpayer shall not preclude the taxpayer from filing amended returns within the time period specified herein, and the amended returns may be audited within the time period stated in paragraph (vii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to assess deficient severance tax payments, interest and penalty, if any, for the same periods governing mine product valuation amendments pursuant to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subsection;</p>

                  <p>(viii) In order to examine relevant books or records of a taxpayer subject to a tax imposed by this article or to secure any information related to enforcement of this article, authorized representatives of the department may at any time during normal business hours enter premises of a taxpayer liable for a tax imposed by this article or the premises of any third party having information regarding that taxpayer's liability. Prior to entering the premises of a taxpayer or third party, the department shall provide fourteen (14) days written notice to the taxpayer and third party;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The state may employ auditors and obtain other technical assistance necessary to determine if the tax imposed by this article has been properly reported and paid.</p>
                  <p>(c) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating interest regarding severance tax, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. In calculating interest regarding ad valorem tax, the county treasurer shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. The board of county commissioners shall be bound by any decision made by the department of revenue in the course of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section concerning the time period during which interest shall accrue and be due and payable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Taxes are delinquent pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection when a taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the total tax liability was not paid when due;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except for any delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-307(b)(ii) is delinquent after the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Effective January 15, 2015, for delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-307(b) shall be delinquent following the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (iv) of this subsection until paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Effective January 1, 2015, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to all delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section on any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be less than twelve percent (12%) nor greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. The interest rate on any delinquent severance and ad valorem tax from any mineral produced before January 1, 2015, shall be as provided by the statutes in effect at the time the mineral was produced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating penalty, the department or board of county commissioners shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any penalty due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails to file the report required by W.S. 39-14-307(a)(i) by the due date or any extension thereof, the department may impose a penalty equal to a total of one percent (1%) of the taxable value of the production from the well, mine or mining claim but not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof that the report or information is late. If any person fails to file reports and other information required by rule of the department of revenue other than those required by W.S. 39-14-307(a)(iv) or 39-14-307(a)(i), the department may impose a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The department may waive penalties under this paragraph for good cause. Penalties imposed under this paragraph may be appealed to the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person fails to make or file a return and remit the tax as required by W.S. 39-14-307, the department shall impose a penalty of five percent (5%) of the taxes due for each thirty (30) day period, or fraction thereof, elapsing between the due date of the return and the date filed, unless the person for good cause obtains from the department an extension of time for filing prior to the due date for filing. In no event shall the total penalty imposed by this subsection exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return for any one (1) month in a calendar year, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The return was filed within five (5) business days following the due date, including an approved extension period; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within fifteen (15) days after the return was filed, setting forth the reasons for the late filing.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If any part of a tax deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, there shall be added a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of the deficiency plus interest as provided by paragraph (c)(iv) of this section. The taxes, penalty and interest shall be paid by the taxpayer within ten (10) days after receipt of notice and demand by the department;</p>
                  <p>(v) The department may credit or waive penalties imposed by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(e) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>

                  <p>(iv) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the state of Wyoming. The lien is on all property in the state of Wyoming, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any person severing minerals in this state and who is liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of the severance tax and corresponding penalty or interest as of the date such taxes, fees, penalties or interest is due, and remains a lien until paid;</p>
                  <p>(v) A lien under this subsection is also a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any lien arising under this subsection is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The department may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the department until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to perfect a tax lien under this subsection, the department of revenue shall file a notice of the tax lien with the secretary of state. The notice of the tax lien shall contain:</p>
                  <p>(A) The name and last known address of the person or persons against whose property the lien is filed including, but not limited to, the person severing the mineral;</p>

                  <p>(D) A statement that the amount of the unpaid tax, fees, penalties or interest is a lien on all property, real, tangible or intangible, including all after acquired property and rights to the property belonging to the person who severed the mineral and located within the state of Wyoming, as well as all interest in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and any future production from the same mineral leasehold.</p>
                  <p>(ix) No other action beyond that described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall be required to perfect a tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(x) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(xi) One (1) notice of the tax lien shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any tax lien created under this subsection and duly filed with the secretary of state shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the state;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) In the event of foreclosure, the department of revenue shall be entitled to recover the costs of filing the lien, foreclosing on the lien and reasonable attorney's fees;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) All notice of tax liens shall be released within sixty (60) days after taxes, penalties and interest due are paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(xv) Notwithstanding that the lien is a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and on all future production from the same leasehold, the department may for good cause shown, release the lien on all property in this state, real, tangible and intangible, and settle delinquent taxes, interest and penalties to be collected against future production from that leasehold;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) The secretary of state is authorized and directed to maintain copies of all tax liens filed by the department of revenue pursuant to this chapter, and to maintain a data base of such tax liens and to provide copies to any person pursuant to the duties of the secretary of state as set forth in W.S. 9-1-301 et seq. All tax liens on file with any county in this state and in good standing on the effective date of this paragraph shall remain effective and in good standing. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this paragraph, the director of the department of revenue shall transmit to the secretary of state for filing copies of all tax liens that the director seeks to have in continuing effect. Upon the filing of a copy of the tax lien with the secretary of state, the tax lien shall continue to be fully effective until released by the department of revenue.</p>

                  <p>(ii) A taxpayer may request and the department shall provide written interpretations of these statutes and rules. When requesting an interpretation, a taxpayer must set forth the facts and circumstances pertinent to the issue.

                  <p>(iv) The state board of equalization shall perform the duties specified in article 15, section 10 of the Wyoming constitution and shall hear appeals from county boards of equalization and review final decisions of the department upon application of any interested person adversely affected, including boards of county commissioners for the purposes of this subsection, under the contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the board;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the board, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.</p>

Any refund granted shall be subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a taxpayer has reason to believe that taxes imposed by this article have been overpaid, a request for refund shall be filed with the department by submitting an amended return within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-307(a)(i). Refunds of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), or less may be applied to subsequent payments for taxes imposed by this article. Requests for refunds exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) shall be approved in writing by the department prior to the taxpayer receiving credit. All refunds granted are subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, the taxpayer is entitled to receive a refund of any overpaid ad valorem or severance tax identified by an audit regardless of whether a refund has been requested.</p>
                  <p>(d) Credits. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any refund may, at the discretion of the board of county commissioners, be made in the form of credit against future tax payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Unless otherwise agreed to by the taxpayer, refunds in the form of credit against future tax payments shall be made in no less than equal annual amounts. The board of county commissioners shall not provide a credit for interest on the excess tax paid unless the taxes are paid under protest due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization and the taxpayer prevails in the appeal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If a taxpayer overpaid taxes imposed by this article, the department shall allow a credit in the amount of the overpayment to be taken on the taxpayer's subsequent monthly reports for the production year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) Escrow. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If ad valorem taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the county treasurer shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in an interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the county treasurer shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the county an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If severance taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the department shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in a separate interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered by the state board of equalization or the court. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the department shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the state an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) This provision does not enlarge or curtail the ability of a taxpayer to appeal any department of revenue decision as otherwise provided for under this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is levied a severance tax on the value of the gross product for the privilege of severing or extracting bentonite in the state. The severance tax imposed by this article may be in addition to other taxes, including but not limited to the ad valorem taxes imposed by W.S. 39-13-104.</p>
                  <p>(b) Basis of tax (valuation). The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Bentonite shall be valued for taxation as provided in this subsection. Based upon the information received or procured pursuant to W.S. 39-14-407(a) or 39-14-408(a)(i), the department shall annually value the gross product for the preceding calendar year, in appropriate unit measures of all mines and mining claims from which valuable deposits are produced, at the fair market value of the product at the mouth of the mine where produced, after the mining or production process is completed;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the event the bentonite is sold at or prior to the mouth of the mine without further movement or processing, the fair market value shall be the total mineral sales revenue received or receivable by the individual producer less amounts paid or payable by the producer for exempt royalty;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In the event the bentonite is not sold at the mouth of the mine by bona fide arms-length sale, or, except as hereafter provided, if the product of the mine is used without sale, the department shall determine the fair market value of bentonite in accordance with paragraph (iv) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The department shall determine the value of bentonite for severance and ad valorem tax purposes as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) For bentonite sold away from the mouth of the mine, the taxable value shall be calculated by adding to each producer's actual direct cost of mining per unit, an allocation of indirect costs, overhead and profit, per unit, as determined by the method prescribed in subdivision (I) of this subparagraph plus nonexempt royalty and production taxes per unit:</p>
                  <p>(I) The allocation of indirect costs, overhead and profit, shall be determined initially and effective with the implementation of this section, by first calculating a bentonite industry wide percentage add-on factor, determined as prescribed in subdivision (II) of this subparagraph, and second by multiplying this initial industry factor times each producer's actual average direct mining costs to mine-mouth per unit, excluding royalty and production taxes. This add-on amount shall be computed prospectively for each producer each year as prescribed in subdivision (III) of this subparagraph;</p>
                  <p>(II) The industry factor shall initially be determined by an audit of 1989 production data conducted in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (IV) of this subparagraph. The initial industry factor shall be the same for all producers for 1990 which shall represent the base line year. The subsequent add-on factors for each producer will be determined each year as defined in subdivision (III) of this subparagraph;</p>
                  <p>(III) Subsequent adjustments to the add-on amount as initially determined under the provisions of subdivision (II) of this subparagraph and as subsequently determined under the provisions of this subdivision shall be recalculated each year with the base year being the initial year of this act. The recalculated add-on amount per unit for each producer shall be determined by multiplying the previous, or initial, add-on percentage amount by the difference between each individual bentonite producer's percentage increase or decrease in mining costs per unit from the percentage increase or decrease in sales price per unit and then adding this amount to the initial industry wide or previous percentage add-on factor. Sales price per unit for purposes of this formula shall be the weighted average sales price per unit for each producer based on the actual arms-length sales of milled bentonite used for taconite, foundry and drilling mud applications (including crushed and dried shipments), where user destinations are known to be in the United States and Canada. Packaged sales of bentonite in these three (3) categories shall be included after deducting the packaging premium. The packaging premium shall be calculated by subtracting the weighted average sales price per ton of bulk sales in these three (3) categories from the weighted average sales price per ton of package sales in these three (3) categories. If substantial arms-length transactions, which are at least five percent (5%) of total transactions in a particular category, do not exist for a producer in a specific targeted sales category, average pricing determined from arms- length transactions in that specific category by all producers shall be imposed. In no event shall the value of the bentonite product include any processing functions or operations regardless of where the processing is performed. As used in this subsection, direct mining costs include but are not limited to mining labor including mine foremen and supervisory personnel whose primary responsibility is extraction of bentonite, supplies used for mining, mining equipment, fuel, power and other utilities used for mining, maintenance of mining equipment, depreciation of mining equipment, reclamation, ad valorem property taxes on mining equipment, transportation of bentonite from the point of severance to the point of valuation and any other costs incurred prior to the point of valuation that are directly and specifically attributable to the mining operation. Royalty and production taxes shall be excluded from mine mouth cost for purposes of computation. In no event and under no circumstances shall the value of bentonite be less than the direct mining costs plus nonexempt royalty and production taxes;</p>
                  <p>(IV) At four (4) year intervals and for the base year the taxable value per unit for each producer shall be revised using the proportionate profits method. Each producer's add-on factor shall be adjusted to provide the taxable value equivalent to the value derived using the proportionate profits method with a direct cost ratio. The direct cost ratio shall be total direct mining costs divided by total direct mining, processing and transportation costs. The sales price per unit, as described in subdivision (III) of this subparagraph, shall exclude all royalties and production taxes. The taxable value shall be derived based on an audit of the most current completed year's data conducted in the producer's offices. Should the audit not be performed, the producer's factor shall be adjusted according to subdivision (III) of this subparagraph until the audit is performed, and then the revised factor shall be applied prospectively. Thereafter, the revised factor for each producer shall be adjusted according to subdivision (III) of this subparagraph.</p>
                  <p>(v) The value of the gross product shall be the fair market value of the product at the mouth of the mine where produced, after the mining or production process is completed;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Except as otherwise provided, the mining or production process is deemed completed when mineral product reaches the mouth of the mine. In no event shall the value of the mineral product include any processing functions or operations regardless of where the processing is performed;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Except as otherwise provided, if the product as defined in paragraph (vi) of this subsection is sold at the mouth of the mine, the fair market value shall be deemed to be the price established by bona fide arms-length sale.</p>
                  <p>(c) Taxpayer. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of the gross product of all mines and mining claims produced under lease, the lessor is liable for the payment of ad valorem taxes on the product removed only to the extent of the lessor's retained interest under the lease, whether royalty or otherwise, and the lessee or his assignee is liable for all other property taxes due on production under the lease;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any taxpayer paying the taxes imposed by this article on any valuable deposit may deduct the severance taxes paid from any amounts due or to become due to the interest owners of such valuable deposit in proportion to the interest ownership;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any person extracting valuable products subject to this article and any person owning an interest in the valuable products to the extent of their interest ownership are liable for the payment of the severance taxes imposed by this article together with any penalties and interest.</p>

                  <p>(a) Returns and reports. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before February 25 of the year following the year of production any person whose property is subject to W.S. 39-14-402(a) shall sign under oath and submit a statement listing the information relative to the property and affairs of the company as the department may require to assess the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For mines and mining claims, the department may presume that the property is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-403 shall report monthly to the department. The monthly tax reports are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Reports shall be filed on forms prescribed by the department. The department may allow extensions for filing returns by regulation;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly reporting requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall report annually. The annual report is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who reports annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence reporting monthly as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly reporting requirements or from monthly to annual reporting;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For mines and mining claims, the taxpayer shall report the location of the production to the county and tax district in which the mine or mining claim is located, based upon the actual taxable production produced by the mine in each county or tax district. Other reasonable methods of reporting the location of production may be approved by the department upon written request of the taxpayer or taxing jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement in sealed envelopes of total tax due, itemized as to property description, assessed value and mill levies, to each taxpayer at his last known address. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ad valorem taxes provided by this act are due and payable:</p>
                  <p>(A) For the 2019 tax year and all preceding tax years, at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective January 1, 2020 for tax year 2020 and each year thereafter, ad valorem taxes are due as provided in W.S. 39-13-113.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for a severance tax under W.S. 39-14-403(a) shall pay monthly tax payments to the department. The payment shall be determined by the taxpayer based on the value of the gross product produced and saved during the second preceding month, and tax computed on value at rates prescribed in this article. The monthly tax payments are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly payment requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall pay the tax annually. The annual payment is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence remitting tax payments as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly payment requirements or from monthly to annual payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Timelines. Except as otherwise specifically provided, there are no specific applicable provisions for timelines for this article.</p>

                  <p>(iii) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to certify mine product valuation amendments to the county assessor of the county in which the property is located, to be entered upon the assessment rolls of the county and taxes computed and collected thereon subject to appeal under W.S. 39-14-409(b)(ii), provided that the return is filed within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-407(a)(i), and that the audit or review commenced within the time period as required by paragraph (vii) of this subsection. Commencement of an audit, completion of an audit, and final audit findings and final determination by the department being issued to the taxpayer shall not preclude the taxpayer from filing amended returns within the time period specified herein, and the amended returns may be audited within the time period stated in paragraph (vii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to assess deficient severance tax payments, interest and penalty, if any, for the same periods governing mine product valuation amendments pursuant to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subsection;</p>

If the examination discloses evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer in reporting and paying the tax, the department may examine all pertinent records for any reporting period without regard to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (vii) and s(viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to examine relevant books or records of a taxpayer subject to a tax imposed by this article or to secure any information related to enforcement of this article, authorized representatives of the department may at any time during normal business hours enter premises of a taxpayer liable for a tax imposed by this article or the premises of any third party having information regarding that taxpayer's liability. Prior to entering the premises of a taxpayer or third party, the department shall provide fourteen (14) days written notice to the taxpayer and third party;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The state may employ auditors and obtain other technical assistance necessary to determine if the tax imposed by this article has been properly reported and paid.</p>
                  <p>(c) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating interest regarding severance tax, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. In calculating interest regarding ad valorem tax, the county treasurer shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. The board of county commissioners shall be bound by any decision made by the department of revenue in the course of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section concerning the time period during which interest shall accrue and be due and payable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Taxes are delinquent pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection when a taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the total tax liability was not paid when due;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except for any delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-407(b)(ii) is delinquent after the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Effective January 15, 2015, for delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-407(b) shall be delinquent following the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (iv) of this subsection until paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Effective January 1, 2015, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to all delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section on any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be less than twelve percent (12%) nor greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. The interest rate on any delinquent severance and ad valorem tax from any mineral produced before January 1, 2015, shall be as provided by the statutes in effect at the time the mineral was produced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating penalty, the department or board of county commissioners shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any penalty due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails to file the report required by W.S. 39-14-407(a)(i) by the due date or any extension thereof, the department may impose a penalty equal to a total of one percent (1%) of the taxable value of the production from the well, mine or mining claim but not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof that the report or information is late. If any person fails to file reports and other information required by rule of the department of revenue other than those required by W.S. 39-14-407(a)(iv) or 39-14-407(a)(i), the department may impose a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The department may waive penalties under this paragraph for good cause. Penalties imposed under this paragraph may be appealed to the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person fails to make or file a return and remit the tax as required by W.S. 39-14-407(a)(iv), the department shall impose a penalty of five percent (5%) of the taxes due for each thirty (30) day period, or fraction thereof, elapsing between the due date of the return and the date filed, unless the person for good cause obtains from the department an extension of time for filing prior to the due date for filing. In no event shall the total penalty imposed by this subsection exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return for any one (1) month in a calendar year, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The return was filed within five (5) business days following the due date, including an approved extension period; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within fifteen (15) days after the return was filed, setting forth the reasons for the late filing.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If any part of a tax deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, there shall be added a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of the deficiency plus interest as provided by paragraph (c)(iv) of this section. The taxes, penalty and interest shall be paid by the taxpayer within ten (10) days after receipt of notice and demand by the department;</p>
                  <p>(v) The department may credit or waive penalties imposed by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(e) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>

                  <p>(iv) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the state of Wyoming. The lien is on all property in the state of Wyoming, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any person severing minerals in this state and who is liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of the severance tax and corresponding penalty or interest as of the date such taxes, fees, penalties or interest is due, and remains a lien until paid;</p>
                  <p>(v) A lien under this subsection is also a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any lien arising under this subsection is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The department may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the department until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to perfect a tax lien under this subsection, the department of revenue shall file a notice of the tax lien with the secretary of state. The notice of the tax lien shall contain:</p>
                  <p>(A) The name and last known address of the person or persons against whose property the lien is filed including, but not limited to, the person severing the mineral;</p>

                  <p>(D) A statement that the amount of the unpaid tax, fees, penalties or interest is a lien on all property, real, tangible or intangible, including all after acquired property and rights to the property belonging to the person who severed the mineral and located within the state of Wyoming, as well as all interest in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and any future production from the same mineral leasehold.</p>
                  <p>(ix) No other action beyond that described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall be required to perfect a tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(x) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(xi) One (1) notice of the tax lien shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any tax lien created under this subsection and duly filed with the secretary of state shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the state;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) In the event of foreclosure, the department of revenue shall be entitled to recover the costs of filing the lien, foreclosing on the lien and reasonable attorney's fees;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) All notice of tax liens shall be released within sixty (60) days after taxes, penalties and interest due are paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(xv) Notwithstanding that the lien is a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and on all future production from the same leasehold, the department may for good cause shown, release the lien on all property in this state, real, tangible and intangible, and settle delinquent taxes, interest and penalties to be collected against future production from that leasehold;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) The secretary of state is authorized and directed to maintain copies of all tax liens filed by the department of revenue pursuant to this chapter, and to maintain a data base of such tax liens and to provide copies to any person pursuant to the duties of the secretary of state as set forth in W.S. 9-1-301 et seq. All tax liens on file with any county in this state and in good standing on the effective date of this paragraph shall remain effective and in good standing. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this paragraph, the director of the department of revenue shall transmit to the secretary of state for filing copies of all tax liens that the director seeks to have in continuing effect. Upon the filing of a copy of the tax lien with the secretary of state, the tax lien shall continue to be fully effective until released by the department of revenue.</p>

                  <p>(ii) A taxpayer may request and the department shall provide written interpretations of these statutes and rules. When requesting an interpretation, a taxpayer must set forth the facts and circumstances pertinent to the issue. If the department deems the facts and circumstances provided to be insufficient, it may request additional information. A taxpayer may act in reliance upon a written interpretation through the end of the calendar year in which the interpretation was issued, or until revoked by the department, whichever occurs last if the pertinent facts and circumstances were substantially correct and fully disclosed.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Following determination of the fair market value of property the department shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the assessed value. The person assessed may file written objections to the assessment with the board within thirty (30) days of the date of postmark and appear before the board at a time specified by the board.

                  <p>(ii) Mine product valuation amendments under this section may be appealed by the taxpayer to the board within thirty (30) days of the final administrative decision;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any taxpayer who feels aggrieved by the valuation and taxes levied by this article may appeal to the board. The appeal does not relieve the taxpayer from paying the tax when due and payable nor does the payment invalidate the appeal. No restraining order or injunction shall be granted or issued by any court or judge to restrain or enjoin the collection of any tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The state board of equalization shall perform the duties specified in article 15, section 10 of the Wyoming constitution and shall hear appeals from county boards of equalization and review final decisions of the department upon application of any interested person adversely affected, including boards of county commissioners for the purposes of this paragraph, under the contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the board;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the board, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.</p>

Any refund granted shall be subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a taxpayer has reason to believe that taxes imposed by this article have been overpaid, a request for refund shall be filed with the department by submitting an amended return within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-407(a)(i). Refunds of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), or less may be applied to subsequent payments for taxes imposed by this article. Requests for refunds exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) shall be approved in writing by the department prior to the taxpayer receiving credit. All refunds granted are subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, the taxpayer is entitled to receive a refund of any overpaid ad valorem or severance tax identified by an audit regardless of whether a refund has been requested.</p>

                  <p>(i) Any refund may, at the discretion of the board of county commissioners, be made in the form of credit against future tax payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Unless otherwise agreed to by the taxpayer, refunds in the form of credit against future tax payments shall be made in no less than equal annual amounts. The board of county commissioners shall not provide a credit for interest on the excess tax paid unless the taxes are paid under protest due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization and the taxpayer prevails in the appeal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If a taxpayer overpaid taxes imposed by this article, the department shall allow a credit in the amount of the overpayment to be taken on the taxpayer's subsequent monthly reports for the production year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) Escrow. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If ad valorem taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the county treasurer shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in an interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal peal has been rendered. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the county treasurer shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the county an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If severance taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the department shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in a separate interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered by the state board of equalization or the court. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the department shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the state an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) This provision does not enlarge or curtail the ability of a taxpayer to appeal any department of revenue decision as otherwise provided for under this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is levied a severance tax on the value of the gross product for the privilege of severing or extracting uranium in the state. The severance tax imposed by this article may be in addition to other taxes, including but not limited to the ad valorem taxes imposed by W.S. 39-13-104.</p>

                  <p>(i) Uranium shall be valued for taxation as provided in this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The value of the gross product shall be the fair market value of the product at the mouth of the mine where produced, after the mining or production process is completed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as otherwise provided, the mining or production process is deemed completed when mineral product reaches the mouth of the mine. In no event shall the value of the mineral product include any processing functions or operations regardless of where the processing is performed;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the event the product as provided by paragraph (iii) of this subsection is sold at the mouth of the mine without further movement or processing, the fair market value shall be the price established by bona fide arms-length sale less exempt royalties;</p>
                  <p>(v) In the event the mineral product as provided by paragraph (iii) of this subsection is not sold at the mouth of the mine by a bona fide arms-length sale, or, except as otherwise provided, if the product of the mine is used without sale, the department shall determine the fair market value of uranium in accordance with paragraph (vi) or (vii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The department shall calculate the fair market value of uranium by multiplying the individual producer's sales value of yellow cake less all royalties, ad valorem production taxes, and severance taxes multiplied by the industry factor. The industry factor shall be an average of all uranium producers' ratios of total mining costs to total mining and processing costs incurred to produce yellow cake calculated by the department. Nonexempt royalties, ad valorem production taxes and severance taxes shall then be added to determine taxable value. For purposes of this paragraph:</p>

                  <p>(B) Total mining costs for conventional surface and underground mines include labor, including mine foremen and supervisory personnel whose primary function is the extraction of uranium, supplies, equipment depreciation and maintenance, fuel, power and other utilities, uranium transportation to the point of valuation, indirect costs related to extraction and any other costs incurred prior to the point of valuation that are specifically attributable to the excavation and transportation of ore to the mine mouth;</p>
                  <p>(C) Total mining and processing costs include mining costs determined under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph plus mineral processing labor including plant foremen and supervisory personnel whose primary responsibility is processing uranium, supplies used for processing, processing plant and equipment depreciation, fuel, power and other utilities used for processing, maintenance of processing equipment, uranium transportation from the mouth of the mine to the point of shipment, indirect processing costs and any other costs incurred that are specifically attributable to the mining or processing of uranium up to the point of sale f.o.b. the mine;</p>
                  <p>(D) Indirect costs include but are not limited to allocations of corporate overhead, data processing costs, accounting, legal and clerical costs and other general and administrative costs which cannot be specifically attributed to an operational function without allocation. Indirect costs shall be allocated using methods in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Similar costs shall be allocated using the same method for each producer;</p>
                  <p>(E) The industry factor shall be recomputed at four (4) year intervals and will be based on an average of the four (4) prior years' cost data. The new ratio shall be effective prospectively.</p>
                  <p>(vii) In the event that unique or unusual circumstances exist such that the department or the taxpayer is unable to determine the value of the gross product of uranium from a mine or mining claim by application of the methods provided in this subsection, the taxpayer may petition the department for approval to use an alternate valuation method.</p>
                  <p>The department shall approve or deny the use of an alternate valuation method and shall so inform the parties within forty- five (45) days of the date the petition is filed.</p>
                  <p>(c) Taxpayer. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of the gross product of all mines and mining claims produced under lease, the lessor is liable for the payment of ad valorem taxes on the product removed only to the extent of the lessor's retained interest under the lease, whether royalty or otherwise, and the lessee or his assignee is liable for all other property taxes due on production under the lease;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any taxpayer paying the taxes imposed by this article on any valuable deposit may deduct the severance taxes paid from any amounts due or to become due to the interest owners of such valuable deposit in proportion to the interest ownership;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any person extracting valuable products subject to this article and any person owning an interest in the valuable products to the extent of their interest ownership are liable for the payment of the severance taxes imposed by this article together with any penalties and interest.</p>

                  <p>(a) Returns, reports. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before February 25 of the year following the year of production any person whose property is subject to W.S. 39-14-502(a) shall sign under oath and submit a statement listing the information relative to the property and affairs of the company as the department may require to assess the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For mines and mining claims, the department may presume that the property is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-503 shall report monthly to the department. The monthly tax reports are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Reports shall be filed on forms prescribed by the department. The department may allow extensions for filing returns by regulation;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly reporting requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall report annually. The annual report is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who reports annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence reporting monthly as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly reporting requirements or from monthly to annual reporting;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For mines and mining claims, the taxpayer shall report the location of the production to the county and tax district in which the mine or mining claim is located, based upon the actual taxable production produced by the mine in each county or tax district. Other reasonable methods of reporting the location of production may be approved by the department upon written request of the taxpayer or taxing jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement in sealed envelopes of total tax due, itemized as to property description, assessed value and mill levies, to each taxpayer at his last known address. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ad valorem taxes provided by this act are due and payable:</p>
                  <p>(A) For the 2019 tax year and all preceding tax years, at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective January 1, 2020 for tax year 2020 and each year thereafter, ad valorem taxes are due as provided in W.S. 39-13-113.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for a severance tax under W.S. 39-14-503(a) shall pay monthly tax payments to the department. The payment shall be determined by the taxpayer based on the value of the gross product produced and saved during the second preceding month, and tax computed on value at rates prescribed in this article. The monthly tax payments are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly payment requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall pay the tax annually. The annual payment is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence remitting tax payments as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly payment requirements or from monthly to annual payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Timelines. Except as otherwise specifically provided, there are no general applicable provisions for timelines for this article.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 84, § 102.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to certify mine product valuation amendments to the county assessor of the county in which the property is located, to be entered upon the assessment rolls of the county and taxes computed and collected thereon subject to appeal under W.S. 39-14-509(b)(ii), provided that the return is filed within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-507(a)(i), and that the audit or review commenced within the time period as required by paragraph (vii) of this subsection.

                  <p>(F) Upon receipt of department review findings, the taxpayer shall have sixty (60) days in which to submit a response.</p>
                  <p>(vi) Where there is evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer in reporting and valuing production, an audit may examine prior years and issue assessments where gross negligence occurred. This section shall not apply to mine product valuation amendments to add the value of unreported production;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Audits provided by this article shall commence within three (3) years and six (6) months immediately following the reporting date for ad valorem taxes and taxpayers shall keep accurate books and records of all production subject to taxes imposed by this article and determinations of taxable value as prescribed by W.S. 39-14-503(b) for a period of seven (7) years and make them available to department examiners for audit purposes. Amended returns filed with the department during the conduct of an audit prior to the issuance of the final audit findings may be made available by the taxpayer to the audit examiners. If the examination discloses evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer in reporting and paying the tax, the department may examine all pertinent records for any reporting period without regard to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (vii) and (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to examine relevant books or records of a taxpayer subject to a tax imposed by this article or to secure any information related to enforcement of this article, authorized representatives of the department may at any time during normal business hours enter premises of a taxpayer liable for a tax imposed by this article or the premises of any third party having information regarding that taxpayer's liability. Prior to entering the premises of a taxpayer or third party, the department shall provide fourteen (14) days written notice to the taxpayer and third party;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The state may employ auditors and obtain other technical assistance necessary to determine if the tax imposed by this article has been properly reported and paid.</p>
                  <p>(c) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating interest regarding severance tax, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. In calculating interest regarding ad valorem tax, the county treasurer shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. The board of county commissioners shall be bound by any decision made by the department of revenue in the course of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section concerning the time period during which interest shall accrue and be due and payable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Taxes are delinquent pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection when a taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the total tax liability was not paid when due;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except for any delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-507(b)(ii) is delinquent after the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Effective January 15, 2015, for delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-507(b) shall be delinquent following the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (iv) of this subsection until paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Effective January 1, 2015, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to all delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section on any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be less than twelve percent (12%) nor greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. The interest rate on any delinquent severance and ad valorem tax from any mineral produced before January 1, 2015, shall be as provided by the statutes in effect at the time the mineral was produced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating penalty, the department or board of county commissioners shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any penalty due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails to file the report required by W.S. 39-14-507(a)(i) by the due date or any extension thereof, the department may impose a penalty equal to a total of one percent (1%) of the taxable value of the production from the well, mine or mining claim but not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof that the report or information is late. If any person fails to file reports and other information required by rule of the department of revenue other than those required by W.S. 39-14-507(a)(iv) or 39-14-507(a)(i), the department may impose a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The department may waive penalties under this paragraph for good cause. Penalties imposed under this paragraph may be appealed to the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person fails to make or file a return and remit the tax as required by W.S. 39-14-507, the department shall impose a penalty of five percent (5%) of the taxes due for each thirty (30) day period, or fraction thereof, elapsing between the due date of the return and the date filed, unless the person for good cause obtains from the department an extension of time for filing prior to the due date for filing. In no event shall the total penalty imposed by this subsection exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return for any one (1) month in a calendar year, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The return was filed within five (5) business days following the due date, including an approved extension period; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within fifteen (15) days after the return was filed, setting forth the reasons for the late filing.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If any part of a tax deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, there shall be added a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of the deficiency plus interest as provided by paragraph (c)(iv) of this subsection. The taxes, penalty and interest shall be paid by the taxpayer within ten (10) days after receipt of notice and demand by the department;</p>

                  <p>(iv) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the state of Wyoming. The lien is on all property in the state of Wyoming, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any person severing minerals in this state and who is liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of the severance tax and corresponding penalty or interest as of the date such taxes, fees, penalties or interest is due, and remains a lien until paid;</p>
                  <p>(v) A lien under this subsection is also a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any lien arising under this subsection is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The department may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the department until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to perfect a tax lien under this subsection, the department of revenue shall file a notice of the tax lien with the secretary of state. The notice of the tax lien shall contain:</p>
                  <p>(A) The name and last known address of the person or persons against whose property the lien is filed including, but not limited to, the person severing the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(B) The name and address of the department of revenue as the holder of the lien and the name of the contact person within the department;</p>

                  <p>(D) A statement that the amount of the unpaid tax, fees, penalties or interest is a lien on all property, real, tangible or intangible, including all after acquired property and rights to the property belonging to the person who severed the mineral and located within the state of Wyoming, as well as all interest in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and any future production from the same mineral leasehold.</p>
                  <p>(ix) No other action beyond that described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall be required to perfect a tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(x) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(xi) One (1) notice of the tax lien shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any tax lien created under this subsection and duly filed with the secretary of state shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the state;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) In the event of foreclosure, the department of revenue shall be entitled to recover the costs of filing the lien, foreclosing on the lien and reasonable attorney's fees;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) All notice of tax liens shall be released within sixty (60) days after taxes, penalties and interest due are paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(xv) Notwithstanding that the lien is a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed and on all future production from the same leasehold, the department may for good cause shown, release the lien on all property in this state, real, tangible and intangible, and settle delinquent taxes, interest and penalties to be collected against future production from that leasehold;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) The secretary of state is authorized and directed to maintain copies of all tax liens filed by the department of revenue pursuant to this chapter, and to maintain a data base of such tax liens and to provide copies to any person pursuant to the duties of the secretary of state as set forth in W.S. 9-1-301 et seq. All tax liens on file with any county in this state and in good standing on the effective date of this paragraph shall remain effective and in good standing. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this paragraph, the director of the department of revenue shall transmit to the secretary of state for filing copies of all tax liens that the director seeks to have in continuing effect. Upon the filing of a copy of the tax lien with the secretary of state, the tax lien shall continue to be fully effective until released by the department of revenue.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>39-14-509. Taxpayer remedies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Interpretation requests. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer may request a value determination from the department and propose a value determination method which may be used until the department issues a value determination. The taxpayer shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal and any additional information the department deems necessary. After the department issues its determination, the taxpayer shall make adjustments based upon the value established or request a hearing by the board;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A taxpayer may request and the department shall provide written interpretations of these statutes and rules. When requesting an interpretation, a taxpayer must set forth the facts and circumstances pertinent to the issue. If the department deems the facts and circumstances provided to be insufficient, it may request additional information. A taxpayer may act in reliance upon a written interpretation through the end of the calendar year in which the interpretation was issued, or until revoked by the department, whichever occurs last if the pertinent facts and circumstances were substantially correct and fully disclosed.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Following determination of the fair market value of property the department shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the assessed value. The person assessed may file written objections to the assessment with the board within thirty (30) days of the date of postmark and appear before the board at a time specified by the board. The person assessed shall also file a copy of the written objections with the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located, who shall notify the county assessor and the board of county commissioners, with an estimate of the tax amount under appeal based upon the previous year's tax levy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Mine product valuation amendments under this section may be appealed by the taxpayer to the board within thirty (30) days of the final administrative decision;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any taxpayer who feels aggrieved by the valuation and taxes levied by this article may appeal to the board. The appeal does not relieve the taxpayer from paying the tax when due and payable nor does the payment invalidate the appeal. No restraining order or injunction shall be granted or issued by any court or judge to restrain or enjoin the collection of any tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The state board of equalization shall perform the duties specified in article 15, section 10 of the Wyoming constitution and shall hear appeals from county boards of equalization and review final decisions of the department upon application of any interested person adversely affected, including boards of county commissioners for the purposes of this subsection, under the contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the board;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the board, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.</p>

Any refund granted shall be subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a taxpayer has reason to believe that taxes imposed by this article have been overpaid, a request for refund shall be filed with the department by submitting an amended return within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-507(a)(i). Refunds of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), or less may be applied to subsequent payments for taxes imposed by this article. Requests for refunds exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) shall be approved in writing by the department prior to the taxpayer receiving credit. All refunds granted are subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, the taxpayer is entitled to receive a refund of any overpaid ad valorem or severance tax identified by an audit regardless of whether a refund has been requested.</p>
                  <p>(d) Credits. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any refund may, at the discretion of the board of county commissioners, be made in the form of credit against future tax payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Unless otherwise agreed to by the taxpayer, refunds in the form of credit against future tax payments shall be made in no less than equal annual amounts. The board of county commissioners shall not provide a credit for interest on the excess tax paid unless the taxes are paid under protest due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization and the taxpayer prevails in the appeal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If a taxpayer overpaid taxes imposed by this article, the department shall allow a credit in the amount of the overpayment to be taken on the taxpayer's subsequent monthly reports for the production year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) Escrow. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If ad valorem taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the county treasurer shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in an interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the county treasurer shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the county an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If severance taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the department shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in a separate interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered by the state board of equalization or the court. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the department shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the state an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) This provision does not enlarge or curtail the ability of a taxpayer to appeal any department of revenue decision as otherwise provided for under this act.</p>

                  <p>(iii) In the event the sand and gravel are not sold at the mouth of the pit or quarry by a bona fide arms-length sale, or, except as otherwise provided, if the product of the pit or quarry is used without sale, the department shall determine the fair market value of sand and gravel in accordance with paragraph (iv) or (v) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For sand and gravel sold away from the mouth of the mine pursuant to a bona fide arms-length sale the department shall calculate the fair market value by multiplying the sales value of the sand and gravel less exempt royalties by twenty- five hundredths (0.25);</p>
                  <p>(v) For sand and gravel used without sale or not sold pursuant to a bona fide arms-length agreement the fair market value shall be the fair market value of sand and gravel which is comparable in quality, quantity, terms and conditions under which the sand and gravel is being used or sold;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The value of the gross product shall be the fair market value of the product at the mouth of the mine where produced, after the mining or production process is completed;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Except as otherwise provided, the mining or production process is deemed completed when the mineral product reaches the mouth of the mine. In no event shall the value of the mineral product include any processing functions or operations regardless of where the processing is performed;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Except as otherwise provided, if the product as provided in paragraph (vii) of this subsection is sold at the mouth of the mine, the fair market value shall be deemed to be the price established by bona fide arms-length sale.</p>
                  <p>(c) Taxpayer. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of the gross product of all mines and mining claims produced under lease, the lessor is liable for the of ad valorem taxes on the product removed only to the extent of the lessor's retained interest under the lease, whether royalty or otherwise, and the lessee or his assignee is liable for all other property taxes due on production under the lease;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any taxpayer paying the taxes imposed by this article on any valuable deposit may deduct the severance taxes paid from any amounts due or to become due to the interest owners of such valuable deposit in proportion to the interest ownership;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any person extracting valuable products subject to this article and any person owning an interest in the valuable products to the extent of their interest ownership are liable for the payment of the severance taxes imposed by this article together with any penalties and interest.</p>

                  <p>(a) Returns and reports. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before February 25 of the year following the year of production any person whose property is subject to W.S. 39-14-602(a) shall sign under oath and submit a statement listing the information relative to the property and affairs of the company as the department may require to assess the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For mines and mining claims, the department may presume that the property is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-603 shall report monthly to the department. The monthly tax reports are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Reports shall be filed on forms prescribed by the department. The department may allow extensions for filing returns by regulation;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly reporting requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall report annually. The annual report is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who reports annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence reporting monthly as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly reporting requirements or from monthly to annual reporting;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For mines and mining claims, the taxpayer shall report the location of the production to the county and tax district in which the mine or mining claim is located, based upon the actual taxable production produced by the mine in each county or tax district. Other reasonable methods of reporting the location of production may be approved by the department upon written request of the taxpayer or taxing jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement in sealed envelopes of total tax due, itemized as to property description, assessed value and mill levies, to each taxpayer at his last known address. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ad valorem taxes provided by this act are due and payable:</p>
                  <p>(A) For the 2019 tax year and all preceding tax years, at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective January 1, 2020 for tax year 2020 and each year thereafter, ad valorem taxes are due as provided in W.S. 39-13-113.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for a severance tax under W.S. 39-14-603(a) shall pay monthly tax payments to the department. The payment shall be determined by the taxpayer based on the value of the gross product produced and saved during the second preceding month, and tax computed on value at rates prescribed in this article. The monthly tax payments are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly payment requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall pay the tax annually. The annual payment is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence remitting tax payments as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly payment requirements or from monthly to annual payment.</p>

                  <p>(c) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating interest regarding severance tax, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. In calculating interest regarding ad valorem tax, the county treasurer shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. The board of county commissioners shall be bound by any decision made by the department of revenue in the course of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section concerning the time period during which interest shall accrue and be due and payable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Taxes are delinquent pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection when a taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the total tax liability was not paid when due;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except for any delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-607(b)(ii) is delinquent after the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Effective January 15, 2015, for delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-607(b) shall be delinquent following the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (iv) of this subsection until paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Effective January 1, 2015, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to all delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section on any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be less than twelve percent (12%) nor greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. The interest rate on any delinquent severance and ad valorem tax from any mineral produced before January 1, 2015, shall be as provided by the statutes in effect at the time the mineral was produced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating penalty, the department or board of county commissioners shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any penalty due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails to file the report required by W.S. 39-14-607(a)(i) by the due date or any extension thereof, the department may impose a penalty equal to a total of one percent (1%) of the taxable value of the production from the well, mine or mining claim but not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof that the report or information is late. If any person fails to file reports and other information required by rule of the department of revenue other than those required by W.S. 39-14-607(a)(iv) or 39-14-607(a)(i), the department may impose a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The department may waive penalties under this paragraph for good cause. Penalties imposed under this paragraph may be appealed to the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person fails to make or file a return and remit the tax as required by W.S. 39-14-607 the department shall impose a penalty of five percent (5%) of the taxes due for each thirty (30) day period, or fraction thereof, elapsing between the due date of the return and the date filed, unless the person for good cause obtains from the department an extension of time for filing prior to the due date for filing. In no event shall the total penalty imposed by this subsection exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return for any one (1) month in a calendar year, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The return was filed within five (5) business days following the due date, including an approved extension period; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within fifteen (15) days after the return was filed, setting forth the reasons for the late filing.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If any part of a tax deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, there shall be added a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of the deficiency plus interest as provided by paragraph (c)(iv) of this section. The taxes, penalty and interest shall be paid by the taxpayer within ten (10) days after receipt of notice and demand by the department;</p>
                  <p>(v) The department may credit or waive penalties imposed by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(e) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2002, Ch. 50, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2002, Ch. 50, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed By Laws 2002, Ch. 50, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iv) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the state of Wyoming. The lien is on all property in the state of Wyoming, real, tangible and intangible, including all after acquired property rights, future production and rights to property, of any person severing minerals in this state and who is liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of the severance tax and corresponding penalty or interest as of the date such taxes, fees, penalties or interest is due, and remains a lien until paid;</p>
                  <p>(v) A lien under this subsection is also a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any lien arising under this subsection is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The department may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired.

                  <p>(ix) No other action beyond that described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall be required to perfect a tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(x) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>

                  <p>(xvi) The secretary of state is authorized and directed to maintain copies of all tax liens filed by the department of revenue pursuant to this chapter, and to maintain a data base of such tax liens and to provide copies to any person pursuant to the duties of the secretary of state as set forth in W.S. 9-1-301 et seq.

                  <p><shortTitle>39-14-609. Taxpayer remedies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Interpretation requests. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer may request a value determination from the department and propose a value determination method which may be used until the department issues a value determination. The taxpayer shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal and any additional information the department deems necessary. After the department issues its determination, the taxpayer shall make adjustments based upon the value established or request a hearing by the board;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A taxpayer may request and the department shall provide written interpretations of these statutes and rules. When requesting an interpretation, a taxpayer must set forth the facts and circumstances pertinent to the issue. If the department deems the facts and circumstances provided to be insufficient, it may request additional information. A taxpayer may act in reliance upon a written interpretation through the end of the calendar year in which the interpretation was issued, or until revoked by the department, whichever occurs last if the pertinent facts and circumstances were substantially correct and fully disclosed.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Following determination of the fair market value of property the department shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the assessed value. The person assessed may file written objections to the assessment with the board within thirty (30) days of the date of postmark and appear before the board at a time specified by the board.

                  <p>(iii) Any taxpayer who feels aggrieved by the valuation and taxes levied by this article may appeal to the board. The appeal does not relieve the taxpayer from paying the tax when due and payable nor does the payment invalidate the appeal. No restraining order or injunction shall be granted or issued by any court or judge to restrain or enjoin the collection of any tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The state board of equalization shall perform the duties specified in article 15, section 10 of the Wyoming constitution and shall hear appeals from county boards of equalization and review final decisions of the department upon application of any interested person adversely affected, including boards of county commissioners for the purposes of this subsection, under the contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the board;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the board, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.</p>

Any refund granted shall be subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a taxpayer has reason to believe that taxes imposed by this article have been overpaid, a request for refund shall be filed with the department by submitting an amended return within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-607(a)(i). Refunds of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), or less may be applied to subsequent payments for taxes imposed by this article. Requests for refunds exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) shall be approved in writing by the department prior to the taxpayer receiving credit. All refunds granted are subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, the taxpayer is entitled to receive a refund of any overpaid ad valorem or severance tax identified by an audit regardless of whether a refund has been requested.</p>
                  <p>(d) Credits. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any refund may, at the discretion of the board of county commissioners, be made in the form of credit against future tax payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Unless otherwise agreed to by the taxpayer, refunds in the form of credit against future tax payments shall be made in no less than equal annual amounts. The board of county commissioners shall not provide a credit for interest on the excess tax paid unless the taxes are paid under protest due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization and the taxpayer prevails in the appeal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If a taxpayer overpaid taxes imposed by this article, the department shall allow a credit in the amount of the overpayment to be taken on the taxpayer's subsequent monthly reports for the production year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) Escrow. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If ad valorem taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the county treasurer shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in an interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the county treasurer shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the county an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If severance taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the department shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in a separate interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered by the state board of equalization or the court. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the department shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the state an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) This provision does not enlarge or curtail the ability of a taxpayer to appeal any department of revenue decision as otherwise provided for under this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Returns and reports. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before February 25 of the year following the year of production any person whose property is subject to W.S. 39-14-702(a) shall sign under oath and submit a statement listing the information relative to the property and affairs of the company as the department may require to assess the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All information and reports shall be notarized and signed by a person who has legal authority to bind the taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For mines and mining claims, the department may presume that the property is located in the county in which production is reported by the taxpayer. The department shall not direct any county to provide relief for taxes paid on taxable valuation which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county unless the taxpayer files or is directed to file amended returns within two (2) years of the date of the original certification of the production. Unless there is evidence of bad faith or willful disregard of production circumstances, no taxpayer shall be required to pay taxes on production which was erroneously reported and certified to the wrong county if relief for taxes paid is not allowed under this provision;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (v) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for severance taxes under W.S. 39-14-703 shall report monthly to the department. The monthly tax reports are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Reports shall be filed on forms prescribed by the department. The department may allow extensions for filing returns by regulation;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly reporting requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall report annually. The annual report is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who reports annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence reporting monthly as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly reporting requirements or from monthly to annual reporting;</p>
                  <p>(vi) For mines and mining claims, the taxpayer shall report the location of the production to the county and tax district in which the mine or mining claim is located, based upon the actual taxable production produced by the mine in each county or tax district. Other reasonable methods of reporting the location of production may be approved by the department upon written request of the taxpayer or taxing jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Annually, on or before October 10 the county treasurer shall send a written statement in sealed envelopes of total tax due, itemized as to property description, assessed value and mill levies, to each taxpayer at his last known address. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ad valorem taxes provided by this act are due and payable:</p>
                  <p>(A) For the 2019 tax year and all preceding tax years, at the office of the county treasurer of the county in which the taxes are levied. Fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after September 1 and payable on and after November 10 in each year and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes are due on and after March 1 and payable on and after May 10 of the succeeding calendar year except as hereafter provided. If the entire tax is paid on or before December 31, no interest or penalty is chargeable;</p>
                  <p>(B) Effective January 1, 2020 for tax year 2020 and each year thereafter, ad valorem taxes are due as provided in W.S. 39-13-113.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection, each taxpayer liable for a severance tax under W.S. 39-14-703 shall pay monthly tax payments to the department. The payment shall be determined by the taxpayer based on the value of the gross product produced and saved during the second preceding month, and tax computed on value at rates prescribed in this article. The monthly tax payments are due on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer's liability for severance tax imposed under this article is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, monthly payment requirements are waived and the taxpayer shall pay the tax annually. The annual payment is due on February 25 of the year following the year in which production occurred. If a taxpayer who pays annually accumulates an annual liability exceeding thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), that taxpayer shall commence remitting tax payments as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection during the production year following the year in which the accumulated tax liability exceeded thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the department concerning the change from annual to monthly payment requirements or from monthly to annual payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Timelines. Except as otherwise specifically provided, there are no general applicable provisions for timelines for this article.</p>

                  <p>(ii) When a taxpayer producing valuable deposits fails to pay the taxes imposed by this article when due, the purchaser of the produced valuable deposit shall withhold and remit to the department the taxpayer's subsequently accruing taxes on the produced valuable deposit acquired by the purchaser. This provision is subject to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(A) The department shall notify the purchaser and taxpayer in writing on or before the first day of the production month for which subsequent taxes are due that the purchaser shall begin remitting taxes to the department as provided in W.S. 39-14-707(b)(iii);</p>

                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 84, § 102.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to certify mine product valuation amendments to the county assessor of the county in which the property is located, to be entered upon the assessment rolls of the county and taxes computed and collected thereon subject to appeal under W.S. 39-14-709(b)(ii), provided that the return is filed within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-707(a)(i), and that the audit or review commenced within the time period as required by paragraph (vii) of this subsection. Commencement of an audit, completion of an audit, and final audit findings and final determination by the department being issued to the taxpayer shall not preclude the taxpayer from filing amended returns within the time period specified herein, and the amended returns may be audited within the time period stated in paragraph (vii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The department is authorized to rely on final audit findings, taxpayer amended returns or department review, and to assess deficient severance tax payments, interest and penalty, if any, for the same periods governing mine product valuation amendments pursuant to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(v) All audits or department reviews, as applicable, pursuant to paragraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this subsection are subject to the following conditions:</p>

                  <p>(ix) The state may employ auditors and obtain other technical assistance necessary to determine if the tax imposed by this article has been properly reported and paid.</p>
                  <p>(c) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating interest regarding severance tax, the department shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. In calculating interest regarding ad valorem tax, the county treasurer shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any interest due. The board of county commissioners shall be bound by any decision made by the department of revenue in the course of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section concerning the time period during which interest shall accrue and be due and payable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Taxes are delinquent pursuant to paragraphs</p>
                  <p>(iii) and (iv) of this subsection when a taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the total tax liability was not paid when due;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except for any delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-707(b)(ii) is delinquent after the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum. Effective January 15, 2015, for delinquent taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section, the balance of any ad valorem tax not paid as provided by W.S. 39-14-707(b) shall be delinquent following the day on which it is payable and shall bear interest at the rate set forth in paragraph (iv) of this subsection until paid or collected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Effective January 1, 2015, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to all delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit conducted under subsection (b) of this section on any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent severance taxes and ad valorem taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be less than twelve percent (12%) nor greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any mineral produced on or after January 1, 2015. The interest rate on any delinquent severance and ad valorem tax from any mineral produced before January 1, 2015, shall be as provided by the statutes in effect at the time the mineral was produced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. In calculating penalty, the department or board of county commissioners shall first compute a net deficiency amount after subtracting any offsetting credit and then calculate any penalty due;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails to file the report required by W.S. 39-14-707(a)(i) by the due date or any extension thereof, the department may impose a penalty equal to a total of one percent (1%) of the taxable value of the production from the well, mine or mining claim but not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof that the report or information is late. If any person fails to file reports and other information required by rule of the department of revenue other than those required by W.S. 39-14-707(a)(iv) or 39-14-707(a)(i), the department may impose a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The department may waive penalties under this paragraph for good cause. Penalties imposed under this paragraph may be appealed to the state board of equalization;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person fails to make or file a return and remit the tax as required by W.S. 39-14-707, the department shall impose a penalty of five percent (5%) of the taxes due for each thirty (30) day period, or fraction thereof, elapsing between the due date of the return and the date filed, unless the person for good cause obtains from the department an extension of time for filing prior to the due date for filing. In no event shall the total penalty imposed by this subsection exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return for any one (1) month in a calendar year, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The return was filed within five (5) business days following the due date, including an approved extension period; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within fifteen (15) days after the return was filed, setting forth the reasons for the late filing.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If any part of a tax deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, there shall be added a penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of the deficiency plus interest as provided by paragraph (c)(iv) of this section. The taxes, penalty and interest shall be paid by the taxpayer within ten (10) days after receipt of notice and demand by the department;</p>
                  <p>(v) The department may credit or waive penalties imposed by paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(e) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>

                  <p>(iv) All taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed under this article are an automatic and continuing lien in favor of the state of Wyoming.

                  <p>(v) A lien under this subsection is also a lien on all interests in the mineral estate from which the production was severed, and on all future production of the same mineral from the same leasehold, regardless of any change of ownership or change in the person extracting the mineral;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any lien arising under this subsection is superior and paramount to all other liens, claims, mortgages or any other encumbrance of any kind except a lien, claim, mortgage or other encumbrance of record held by a bona fide creditor and properly perfected, filed or recorded under Wyoming law prior to the filing of a lien as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The department may file a notice of lien at any time at its discretion, except no lien shall be enforced until the right of the taxpayer to file and properly perfect an appeal concerning the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization has expired. A properly perfected appeal on the tax delinquent property before the state board of equalization or any subsequent properly perfected appeal on the same property to a district court or the supreme court shall stay enforcement of a lien filed by the department until such appeal has been exhausted or concluded;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In order to perfect a tax lien under this subsection, the department of revenue shall file a notice of the tax lien with the secretary of state. The notice of the tax lien shall contain:</p>

                  <p>(ix) No other action beyond that described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall be required to perfect a tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(x) The filing of the notice of the tax lien as described in paragraph (viii) of this subsection shall constitute record notice of the tax lien;</p>
                  <p>(xi) One (1) notice of the tax lien shall be deemed sufficient to cover all taxes, together with interest, fees and penalty of the same nature which may accrue after the filing of the notice;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any tax lien created under this subsection and duly filed with the secretary of state shall survive the death or incapacitation of any person, and shall survive any other destruction or attempted destruction of any interest in property owned by any person liable under Wyoming law for the collection, payment or remittance of taxes, fees, penalties or interest to the state;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>39-14-709. Taxpayer remedies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Interpretation requests. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxpayer may request a value determination from the department and propose a value determination method which may be used until the department issues a value determination. The taxpayer shall submit all available data relevant to its proposal and any additional information the department deems necessary. After the department issues its determination, the taxpayer shall make adjustments based upon the value established or request a hearing by the board;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A taxpayer may request and the department shall provide written interpretations of these statutes and rules. When requesting an interpretation, a taxpayer must set forth the facts and circumstances pertinent to the issue. If the department deems the facts and circumstances provided to be insufficient, it may request additional information. A taxpayer may act in reliance upon a written interpretation through the end of the calendar year in which the interpretation was issued, or until revoked by the department, whichever occurs last if the pertinent facts and circumstances were substantially correct and fully disclosed.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Following determination of the fair market value of property the department shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the assessed value. The person assessed may file written objections to the assessment with the board within thirty (30) days of the date of postmark and appear before the board at a time specified by the board. The person assessed shall also file a copy of the written objections with the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located, who shall notify the county assessor and the board of county commissioners, with an estimate of the tax amount under appeal based upon the previous year's tax levy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Mine product valuation amendments under this section may be appealed by the taxpayer to the board within thirty (30) days of the final administrative decision;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any taxpayer who feels aggrieved by the valuation and taxes levied by this article may appeal to the board. The appeal does not relieve the taxpayer from paying the tax when due and payable nor does the payment invalidate the appeal. No restraining order or injunction shall be granted or issued by any court or judge to restrain or enjoin the collection of any tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The state board of equalization shall perform the duties specified in article 15, section 10 of the Wyoming constitution and shall hear appeals from county boards of equalization and review final decisions of the department upon application of any interested person adversely affected, including boards of county commissioners for the purposes of this subsection, under the contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. Any interested person adversely affected by the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule pursuant to W.S. 16-3-103(a) shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the board;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any person including the state of Wyoming aggrieved by any order issued by the board, or any county board of equalization whose decision has been reversed or modified by the state board of equalization, may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.</p>
                  <p>(c) Refunds. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If a taxpayer has reason to believe that ad valorem taxes imposed by this article have been overpaid, a request for refund shall be filed with the department by submitting amended returns within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-707(a)(i). Any refund granted shall be subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a taxpayer has reason to believe that taxes imposed by this article have been overpaid, a request for refund shall be filed with the department by submitting an amended return within three (3) years from the date the production should have been reported pursuant to W.S. 39-14-707(a)(i). Refunds of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), or less may be applied to subsequent payments for taxes imposed by this article. Requests for refunds exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) shall be approved in writing by the department prior to the taxpayer receiving credit. All refunds granted are subject to modification or revocation upon audit;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, the taxpayer is entitled to receive a refund of any overpaid ad valorem or severance tax identified by an audit regardless of whether a refund has been requested.</p>
                  <p>(d) Credits. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any refund may, at the discretion of the board of county commissioners, be made in the form of credit against future tax payments for a period not to exceed five (5) years. Unless otherwise agreed to by the taxpayer, refunds in the form of credit against future tax payments shall be made in no less than equal annual amounts. The board of county commissioners shall not provide a credit for interest on the excess tax paid unless the taxes are paid under protest due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization and the taxpayer prevails in the appeal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxpayer is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid gross product or severance tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If a taxpayer overpaid taxes imposed by this article, the department shall allow a credit in the amount of the overpayment to be taken on the taxpayer's subsequent monthly reports for the production year.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) Escrow. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If ad valorem taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the county treasurer shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in an interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the county treasurer shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the county an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If severance taxes are paid under protest to the extent of and due to an appeal pending before the state board of equalization or any court of competent jurisdiction, the department shall deposit that protested amount under appeal in a separate interest bearing escrow account and withhold distribution until a final decision on the appeal has been rendered by the state board of equalization or the court. To the extent the taxpayer prevails in the appeal, the department shall refund that amount under appeal, plus interest earned thereon, to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the day the final decision is rendered. If the taxpayer pays to the state an amount in excess of the protested amount under appeal, the excess shall be distributed as provided by law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) This provision does not enlarge or curtail the ability of a taxpayer to appeal any department of revenue decision as otherwise provided for under this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Returns, reports and preservation of records. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Each vendor shall on or before the last day of each month file a true return showing the preceding month's gross sales and remit all taxes to the department. The returns shall contain such information and be made in the manner as the department by regulation prescribes. The department may allow extensions for filing returns and paying the taxes by regulation, but no extension may be for more than ninety (90) days. If the total tax to be remitted by a vendor during any month is less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), a quarterly or annual return as authorized by the department, and remittance in lieu of the monthly return may be made on or before the last day of the month following the end of the quarter or year for which the tax is collected. If the accounting methods regularly used by any vendor are such that reports of sales made during a calendar month would impose unnecessary hardships, the department after receiving a formal request filed by the vendor may accept reports at intervals as would be more convenient to the taxpayer. Any vendor shall report whether the vendor sells nicotine products, as defined by W.S. 39-18-101(a)(xi), in this state to the department in the form and manner required by the department. The department may reject any report required under this paragraph of any vendor who does not comply with the nicotine sales reporting requirements. Every person purchasing goods or services taxable by this article who does not pay the tax owed to a vendor shall, on or before the last day of each month, file a return showing the gross purchases made during the preceding month and remit all taxes due to the department. The return shall contain such information and be made in the manner as the department shall prescribe by rule and regulation. The department, by rule and regulation, may allow an extension for filing a return and paying any tax due, but no extension shall be granted for more than ninety (90) days;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Every vendor and person liable for the payment of sales tax under this article shall preserve for three (3) years at his principal place of business, suitable records and books as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax for which he is liable under this article, together with all invoices and books showing all merchandise purchased for resale. All records, books and invoices shall be available for examination by the department during regular business hours except as arranged by mutual consent;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any vendor or person liable for the payment of sales tax under this article fails to comply with paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection, he shall bear the burden of proof as to the correctness of any assessment of taxes imposed by the department for the period for which records were not preserved in any court action or proceeding;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a vendor fails to file a return as required by this article, the department shall give written notice by mail to the vendor to file a return on or before the last day of the month following the notice of delinquency. If a vendor then fails to file a return the department shall make a return from the best information available which will be prima facie correct and the tax due therein is a deficiency and subject to penalties and interest as provided by this article;</p>
                  <p>(v) The department shall preserve returns and reports for three (3) years;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The vendor shall file a return within thirty (30) days after discontinuing or selling his business;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Taxes collected under paragraphs (b)(i) and</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this section are due and payable and shall be remitted in full by the county treasurer to the department monthly or as required by the department together with reports as required by the department;</p>
                  <p>(viii) When applying for registration, every new owner of a motorcycle shall produce either:</p>
                  <p>(A) A receipt from the department showing that the sales or use tax has been paid;</p>
                  <p>(B) A receipt on forms provided by the department showing that the motorcycle was purchased from a Wyoming licensed dealer and that the dealer has collected the sales tax; or</p>
                  <p>(C) A certificate from the department that no sales or use tax is due.</p>
                  <p>(ix) As soon as practicable after the return is filed the department shall examine it and if it appears from the information on the return the tax to be remitted is incorrect, the tax shall be recomputed. If the amount remitted exceeds that which is due from the recomputed return, the excess shall be refunded or credited as provided in W.S. 39-15-109(c) and (d);</p>
                  <p>(x) Taxes paid on gross receipts represented by accounts found to be worthless may be credited against subsequent liability of the vendor. The vendor shall not take the credit for any bad debt until he has used the customary debt collection procedures as documented in writing by the vendor and has written off the debt; or until the debt qualifies as a bad debt under 26 U.S.C. section 166 excluding financing charges or interest, sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price, uncollectible amounts on property that remain in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is paid, any expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt, and repossessed property. If any account is thereafter collected by the vendor, a tax shall be paid upon the amount collected. The amount collected shall be applied proportionally first to the taxable price of the property or service and the sales tax thereon, and then to interest, service charges and any other charges. Should the bad debt exceed the taxable sales for a subsequent period the vendor may request a refund of the tax on the bad debt from the department so long as the claim is made within three (3) years of the date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed. A certified service provider under W.S. 39-15-401 through 39-15-408 acting on behalf of a vendor may claim the bad debt allowance for the vendor and shall remit the credit or refund received to the vendor. Should the bad debt apply to more than one (1) state, the debt may be allocated between the affected states.</p>
                  <p>(b) Payment. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Except as provided by paragraph (viii) of this subsection, no vendor shall collect taxes imposed by this article upon the sale of motor vehicles, house trailers, trailer coaches, trailers or semitrailers. The taxes imposed shall be collected by the county treasurer prior to the first registration in Wyoming and not upon subsequent registration by the same applicant. The county treasurer shall collect and remit to the department the tax in effect in the county of the owner's principal residence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except for those vehicles specified under paragraph (viii) of this subsection, the tax imposed by this article upon the sale of a motor vehicle, house trailer, trailer coach, trailer or semitrailer purchased as a gift shall be collected from the donee prior to the first registration based upon the fair market value of the gift at the time of the gift;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Motor vehicle vendors and vendors of house trailers, trailer coaches, trailers or semitrailers shall not be required to pay sales taxes on motor vehicles, house trailers, trailer coaches, trailers or semitrailers if they are registered in the vendor's name, are included as a part of the vendor's inventory and are held principally in the conduct of the vendor's business for sale, demonstration or delivery prior to sale and use, except a motor vehicle vendor shall be liable for payment of sales or use tax on the transfer of a motor vehicle with less than one thousand (1,000) miles on the odometer he purchases if:</p>
                  <p>(A) The vendor is not a properly licensed dealer under W.S. 31-16-101 et seq.;</p>
                  <p>(B) The vehicle he purchased was transferred with a manufacturer's statement of origin or manufacturer's certificate of origin from a properly licensed dealer; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The vehicle was transferred into his inventory for sale, demonstration or delivery.</p>
                  <p>(iv) A person regularly engaged in the business of making loans or a supervised financial institution, as defined in W.S. 40-14-140(a)(xix), that forecloses a lien or repossesses a motor vehicle on which it has filed a lien, or an insurance company that acquires ownership of a motor vehicle pursuant to a damage settlement, shall not be liable for payment of sales or use tax, penalties or interest due under this section or W.S. 39-16-107 for that vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(v) The taxes are due and payable on the last day of the month following the month in which they were collected or as required by the department as specified in this article;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If a sale is made on credit, contract or conditional basis and title does not pass until a future date, there shall be paid upon each payment that portion of the total tax which the amount paid bears to the purchase price. If a vendor discontinues business, the tax shall be computed and paid on the outstanding amount of all credit, installment and conditional sales;</p>
                  <p>(vii) If any vendor collects a tax in excess of that imposed by this article it shall be remitted to the department after making reasonable attempts to identify and refund the excess tax to the taxpayer that originally paid the tax;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Notwithstanding W.S. 39-15-107(b)(i), the tax imposed under this article upon the sale of mopeds and motorcycles as defined in W.S. 31-5-102(a) and off-road recreational vehicles defined by W.S. 31-1-101(a)(xv) shall be collected by the vendor in the manner prescribed by this section;</p>
                  <p>(ix) When the department has reason to believe the collection of any tax, penalty or interest will be jeopardized by delay it shall immediately levy a jeopardy assessment and the amount assessed shall be immediately due and payable. Notice of the assessment shall be given to the vendor personally or by mail. If the jeopardy assessment is not paid within ten (10) days after the service of notice upon the vendor, the deficiency penalty and interest provided in W.S. 39-15-108(c)(ii) shall attach to the amount of the jeopardy assessment;</p>
                  <p>(x) The department may enter into contracts with collection agencies for required collection services on deficiencies of sales tax occurring under W.S. 39-15-101 through 39-15-111. Any taxes recovered by the collection agencies and remitted to the department shall be distributed in accordance with W.S. 39-15-111(b). Any person owing a tax submitted to a collection agency may be assessed a fee in an amount necessary to cover the cost of collection, not to exceed twenty percent (20%) of the tax owed, as provided in W.S. 9-1-415(a). The collection agency shall collect the fee with the tax that is submitted for collection and the amount collected as a fee may be deducted from funds remitted to the department. The contracts entered into under this paragraph shall not be for a term of more than two (2) years and shall be awarded only after competition;</p>
                  <p>(xi) If a vendor or direct payer pays taxes due and payable under this chapter on or before the fifteenth day of the month that the taxes are due under paragraph (v) of this subsection, a credit shall be allowed against the taxes imposed by this chapter for expenses incurred by a vendor or direct payer for the accounting and reporting of taxes. For the first six thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($6,250.00) of tax due, the credit is equal to one and ninety-five hundredths percent (1.95%) of the amount of tax due. For any tax due in excess of six thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($6,250.00), the credit for that additional amount shall be one percent (1%) of that amount, provided that the total credit under this paragraph and W.S. 39-16-107(b)(viii) shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) in any month. The vendor or direct payer shall deduct the credit for each tax period on forms prescribed and furnished by the department. The credit shall be deducted only from the share of the tax that is distributed to the general fund under W.S. 39-15-111(b)(i).</p>
                  <p>(c) Timelines. Except as otherwise specifically provided, there are no general applicable provisions for timelines for this article.</p>

                  <p>(a) Audits. To assess credits and deficiencies against taxpayers and vendors, the department is authorized to rely on final audit findings made by the department of audit, taxpayer information, vendor information or department review subject to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Audits shall commence when the taxpayer or vendor receives written notice of the engagement of the audit. The issuance of the written notice of the audit shall toll the statute of limitations provided in W.S. 39-15-110 for the audit period specified in this subsection. The audit shall be completed by the department of audit with final findings issued to the taxpayer or vendor within one (1) year of the date of the notice of engagement. This time limit may be extended only upon mutual agreement between the taxpayer or vendor and the department;</p>
                  <p>(ii) After receiving notice of an audit under this subsection, the taxpayer or vendor shall preserve all records and books necessary to determine the amount of tax due for the time period that is being audited;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, audits shall encompass a time period not to exceed three (3) years immediately preceding the reporting period when the audit is engaged. The three (3) year limit shall not apply to an audit if:</p>
                  <p>(A) There is evidence of a violation of paragraph (c)(iv) or subsection (f) of this section by the taxpayer or vendor for the reporting period being audited; or</p>
                  <p>(B) There is evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer or vendor in reporting or remitting taxes for the reporting period being audited.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer is not willing or able to produce adequate records to demonstrate taxes due, the department or the department of audit may project taxes based on the best information available. If a vendor is not willing or able to comply with the record requirements of paragraph (c)(xi) of this section, the department or the department of audit may project taxes based on the best information available;</p>
                  <p>(v) Audits under this subsection are subject to the authority and procedures provided in W.S. 9-2-2003.</p>
                  <p>(b) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the amount of tax paid is less than the amount due, the difference together with interest thereon at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the time the return was due shall be paid by the vendor or any person liable for the payment of the sales tax under this article within ten (10) days after notice and demand is made by the department. Effective July 1, 1994, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to the delinquent tax. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any sale made on or after July 1, 1994. The interest rate on any delinquent tax from any sale made before July 1, 1994, shall be one percent (1%) per month from the date the return was due until paid;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the sales or use tax on a vehicle, including local option sales or use tax, under W.S. 39-15-101 through 39-15-211 or 39-16-101 through 39-16-211, is not paid within sixty-five (65) days after the date of the sale, or in the case of a motor vehicle brought into this state, sixty-five (65) days after the vehicle is brought into the state if the owner submits to the county treasurer an affidavit and any other satisfactory proof as necessary to verify the date the vehicle was brought into the state:</p>
                  <p>(A) Interest shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or fractional portion thereof from the sixty-fifth day after the date of sale until the date of payment of all sales tax interest and civil fees due. County treasurers shall collect interest due under this subsection which shall be forwarded to the department and credited to the state general fund;</p>
                  <p>(B) A civil fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) from the sixty-fifth day through the seventy-fifth day after the date of sale shall also be assessed by the county treasurer under this paragraph. If all sales tax, interest and civil fees due are not paid by the seventy-fifth day, the civil fee shall be the twenty-five dollar ($25.00) amount or ten percent (10%) of the amount of tax due, whichever is greater, and shall be assessed by the county treasurer. Civil fees collected under this subparagraph shall be credited to the general fund of the county which makes the collection;</p>
                  <p>(C) The tax is delinquent if the taxpayer or his agent knew or reasonably should have known that the tax liability was not paid within the sixty-five (65) day period.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department may credit or waive interest imposed by this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(c) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>

                  <p>(iii) No vendor shall advertise or state directly or indirectly to the public that the taxes imposed by this article shall be assumed by the vendor or that it will not be considered in the price, or if added, will be refunded;</p>

                  <p>(v) Any person who violates W.S. 39-15-102(e) is guilty of a misdemeanor. Each violation is a separate offense;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any person who files a false or fraudulent return is subject to the provisions of W.S. 6-5-303;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Any person who violates any provision of this article for which there are no specific penalties is guilty of a misdemeanor. Each violation is a separate offense;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The department may, after providing two (2) written notices of intent to revoke identifying the reasons therefore, revoke the license of any vendor violating any provision of this article.

All records, books and invoices shall be available for examination by the department during regular business hours except as arranged by mutual consent;</p>
                  <p>(xii) If a vendor fails to file a return as required by this article, the department shall give written notice by mail to the vendor to file a return on or before the last day of the month following the notice of delinquency.

                  <p>(a) Interpretation requests. There are no specific applicable provisions for interpretation requests for this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. Except as provided by this subsection, no person who feels aggrieved by the payment of the taxes, penalty and interest imposed by this article may appeal a decision of the state board of equalization until all taxes, penalty and interest have been paid. For good cause shown, the court to which the decision of the board is appealed may stay enforcement of the board's order assessing and levying the tax during the pendency of the appeal. The court's stay of enforcement shall not affect the accruing of interest upon any assessment and levy.</p>
                  <p>(c) Refunds. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any tax, penalty or interest which has been erroneously paid, computed or remitted to the department by a vendor shall either be credited against any subsequent tax liability of the vendor or refunded. If a vendor erroneously collects taxes from a taxpayer and remits those taxes to the department, the vendor may seek a refund or credit against subsequent tax liability only after the vendor has refunded the erroneously collected tax to the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor. If the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor cannot be identified, the tax shall not be refunded or credited to the vendor. No credit or refund shall be allowed after three (3) years from the date of overpayment. The receipt of a claim for a refund by the department shall toll the statute of limitations. All refund requests received by the department shall be approved or denied within ninety (90) days of receipt. Any refund or credit erroneously made or allowed may be recovered in an action brought by the attorney general in any court of competent jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any tax erroneously paid by a taxpayer shall be refunded by the vendor who originally collected the tax. No cause of action shall lie against the vendor by the taxpayer until not less than sixty (60) days elapse following a request by the taxpayer for a refund from the vendor.</p>
                  <p>(d) Credits. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any tax, penalty or interest which has been erroneously paid, computed or remitted to the department by a vendor shall either be credited against any subsequent tax liability of the vendor or refunded. If a vendor erroneously collects taxes from a taxpayer and remits those taxes to the department, the vendor may seek a credit against subsequent tax liability or a refund only after the vendor has refunded the erroneously collected tax to the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor. If the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor cannot be identified, the tax shall not be credited or refunded to the vendor. No credit or refund shall be allowed after three (3) years from the date of overpayment. The receipt of a claim for a refund by the department shall toll the statute of limitations. Any refund or credit erroneously made or allowed may be recovered in an action brought by the attorney general in any court of competent jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 2001, Ch. 147, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed by Laws 2016, ch. 33, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The taxpayer or vendor is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid excise tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. This paragraph shall not apply to any tax which was erroneously collected from a taxpayer and remitted by a vendor unless the auditor can determine that the erroneously collected taxes have been refunded to the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>
                  <p>(f) Escrow. There are no specific applicable provisions for escrow for this article.</p>
                  <p>(g) If a mobile telecommunications service customer believes that the amount of tax, assessment or assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included in the customer's billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing. The written notification shall include the street address of the customer's place of primary use, the account name and number, a description of the error claimed by the customer, and any other information which the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request. Within sixty (60) days of receiving a written notice under this subsection, the home service provider shall review its records to determine the customer's taxing jurisdiction. If the review shows that the amount of tax, assessment or assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is in error, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax, charge or fee erroneously billed to the customer for a period of not to exceed three (3) years. If the review shows that the amount of tax, assessment and assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction are correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation to the customer. The procedures in this subsection shall be the first course of remedy available to a customer for a billing dispute, and no cause of action based upon the billing dispute shall accrue until the customer has reasonably exercised the rights and procedures set forth in this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(a) No credit or refund shall be allowed after three (3) years from the date of overpayment. The receipt of a claim for a refund by the department shall toll the statute of limitations.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department may bring an action to recover any delinquent taxes, penalty or interest in any appropriate court within three (3) years following the delinquency. In the case of an assessment created by an audit, the delinquency period is deemed to start thirty (30) days after the date the assessment letter is sent. Any tax penalty and interest related to the audit assessment shall be calculated from the filing period during which the deficiency occurred. In any such action a certificate by the department is prima facie evidence of the amount due.</p>

                  <p>(a) License fees and interest collected by the department pursuant to this article shall be transferred to the state treasurer who shall credit them to the general fund. All penalties collected by the department under this article shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited as provided in W.S. 8-1-109, except the total sum of penalties collected by the department and paid to the state treasurer shall be allocated based upon the ratio of each county's population to the population of the state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Revenues earned under W.S. 39-15-104 during each fiscal year shall be recognized as revenue during that fiscal year for accounting purposes. For all revenue collected by the department under W.S. 39-15-104 the department shall:</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 1/1/2021 this section will read as:</p>
                  <p>Revenues earned under W.S. 39-15-104 during each fiscal year shall be recognized as revenue during that fiscal year for accounting purposes. Except as otherwise provided in subsection</p>
                  <p>(p) of this section, for all revenue collected by the department under W.S. 39-15-104 the department shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Credit sixty-nine percent (69%) to the state general fund for deposit by the state treasurer except as provided by subsections (c) and (d) of this section and less any credit allowed pursuant to W.S. 39-15-107(b)(xi);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Deduct one percent (1%) from the remaining share to cover all administrative expenses and costs attributable to the remaining share and credit for deposit by the state treasurer into the general fund for that amount;</p>
                  <p>(iii) From the remaining share, until June 30, 2004, deduct an amount equivalent to one-half percent (0.5%) and thereafter deduct an amount equivalent to one percent (1%) of the tax collected under W.S. 39-15-104. From this amount, the department shall distribute until June 30, 2004, twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) and thereafter forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) annually to each county in equal monthly installments and then distribute the remainder to each county in the proportion that the total population of the county bears to the total population of the state. The balance shall then be paid monthly to the treasurers of the counties, cities and towns for payment into their respective general funds. The percentage of the balance that will be distributed to each county and its cities and towns will be determined by computing the percentage that net sales taxes collected attributable to vendors in each county including its cities and towns bear to total net sales taxes collected of vendors in all counties including their cities and towns. Subject to subsection (h) of this section, this percentage of the balance shall be distributed within each county as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) To each county in the proportion that the population of the county situated outside the corporate limits of its cities and towns bears to the total population of the county including cities and towns;</p>
                  <p>(B) To each city and town within the county in the proportion the population of the city or town bears to the population of the county.</p>
                  <p>(c) If any person commences after the effective date of this act to construct an industrial facility, as that term is defined in W.S. 35-12-102, under a permit issued pursuant to W.S. 35-12-106, or if the federal or state government commences to construct any project within this state with an estimated construction cost as specified in the definition of industrial facility in W.S. 35-12-102 the department of revenue shall thereafter pay to the county treasurer and the county treasurer will distribute to the county, cities and towns of that county in which the industrial facility or project is located, impact assistance payments from the monies available under paragraph (b)(i) of this section. Each payment to the county treasurer shall be equal to an amount determined by the industrial siting council under this subsection and shall continue during the period of construction except that in the case of an industrial facility or a federal or state government project which is expected to continue in phases for an indefinite period of time, the department of revenue shall discontinue payments under this section when construction of any phase has ceased or been substantially completed for twelve (12) consecutive months. The person constructing the industrial facility and the counties affected by the construction of the industrial facility shall provide evidence at the public hearing held pursuant to W.S. 35-12-110(f)(i) of the mitigated and unmitigated impacts that the construction will have on the counties, cities and towns determined by the industrial siting council to be affected by the construction of the industrial facility. The industrial siting council shall review the evidence of the impacts and determine, applying a preponderance of evidence standard, the dollar amount of the unmitigated impacts. The council shall state, in the order issued under W.S. 35-12-113(a), the total dollar amount of the impact assistance payment and the reasons for determining that amount. The impact assistance payment shall be distributed by the department of revenue in an amount and on a schedule determined by the council, based on evidence presented at the hearing. Under no circumstances shall the impact assistance payment exceed two and seventy-six hundredths percent (2.76%) of the total estimated material costs of the facility, as those costs are determined by the council. The impact assistance payments shall be distributed to the county treasurer and the county treasurer will distribute to the county and to the cities and towns therein based on a ratio established by the industrial siting council during a public hearing held in accordance with W.S. 35-12-110(f)(i). The industrial siting council shall review the distribution ratio for construction projects on a regular basis and make appropriate adjustments. A governing body which is primarily affected by the facility, or any person issued a permit pursuant to W.S. 35-12-106, may petition the industrial siting council for review and adjustment of the distribution ratio or the amount of the impact assistance payment upon a showing of good cause. The impact assistance payment shall be in addition to all other distributions under this section, but no impact assistance payment shall be made for any period in which the county or counties are not imposing at least a one percent (1%) tax authorized by W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) and 39-16-204(a)(i) or at least a total of a two percent (2%) sales tax authorized under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i), (iii) and (vi) and at least a total of a two percent (2%) use tax authorized under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(i), (ii) and (v). For purposes of this subsection, the industrial facility or federal or state government project will be deemed to be located in the county in which a majority of the construction costs will be expended, provided that upon a request from the county commissioners of any adjoining county to the industrial siting council, the council may determine that the social and economic impacts from construction of the industrial facility or federal or state government project upon the adjoining county are significant and establish the ratio of impacts between the counties and certify that ratio to the department of revenue who will thereafter distribute the impact assistance payment to the counties pursuant to that ratio. The industrial siting council shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(d) As used in subsection (c) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Period of construction" begins at the commencement of construction and ends when the physical components of the industrial facility or federal or state government project are ninety percent (90%) complete, provided, if payments are already being made under this act, commencement of construction of another industrial facility or federal or state government project will not be considered for purposes of establishing a new impact assistance payment amount or determining when payments will commence under this act, but will only be considered for determining when the period of construction ends;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 107, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(e) Vendors shall annually provide the department information indicating the amount of tax under this article collected from sales of propane, butane, liquefied gas and compressed natural gas. Upon verification by the department, the state treasurer shall annually transfer from the revenues deposited pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) of this section to the state highway fund ten percent (10%) of the amount collected under this article on sales of propane, butane, liquefied gas and compressed natural gas. This transfer of revenue replaces highway revenues existing prior to the enactment of this act.</p>
                  <p>(f) In addition to the distribution specified in subsection (b) of this section, until June 30, 2004, twenty- nine and one-half percent (29.5%) and thereafter thirty-one percent (31%) of sales taxes collected from out-of-state vendors shall be distributed to counties, cities and towns in the same percentage as determined in paragraph (b)(iii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) Repealed By Laws 2007, Ch. 140, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(h) If an annexation occurs under W.S. 15-1-404, the department of revenue shall determine whether the proportion of sales taxes to be distributed to the general fund of the county in which the annexation takes place will be reduced by more than five percent (5%) solely as a result of the annexation. If so, then the distribution formula for sales taxes for the affected municipality and county is subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Beginning with the month following the month in which the annexation occurs and continuing through the remainder of the fiscal year in which the annexation occurs, the annexing municipality shall receive credit only for thirty-five percent (35%) of the population of the area to be annexed with the remainder credited to the county;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In each of the succeeding four (4) fiscal years, the annexing municipality shall receive credit for an additional one-fourth (1/4) of the remaining sixty-five percent (65%) of the population of the area annexed with the remainder credited to the county;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department of revenue shall proportionally adjust credits for population under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection for the remainder of the period based upon new population figures if a federal decennial census occurs before the period under paragraph (ii) of this subsection ends.</p>
                  <p>(j) Repealed By Laws 1999, ch. 54, § 2.</p>

                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The following provisions apply to imposition of the general purpose excise tax under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i):</p>
                  <p>(A) Except as provided by subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, no tax shall be imposed under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) until the proposition to impose the taxes is submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the county, and a majority of those casting their ballots vote in favor of imposing the taxes. If a county seeks to increase a tax rate previously approved by the qualified electors of the county that increase shall be separately proposed and voted upon, provided that the total amount of the separate propositions is subject to the limitations specified in W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) and (iv). A county may impose both taxes authorized in W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) and (ii), but the proposition to impose each tax also shall be individually stated and voted upon. Except as otherwise provided, excise taxes imposed under this paragraph shall commence as provided by W.S. 39-15-207(c) following the election approving the imposition of the tax;</p>
                  <p>(B) The proposition to impose an excise tax shall be at the expense of the county and be submitted to the electors of the county upon the receipt by the board of county commissioners of a petition requesting the election signed by at least five percent (5%) of the electors of the county or of a resolution approving the proposition from the governing body of the county and the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county.

If the proposition is approved the same proposition shall be submitted at subsequent general elections as provided in this subparagraph until the proposition is defeated. If the tax proposed is approved after July 1, 1989, the same proposition shall be submitted at every other subsequent general election until the proposition is defeated. However in those counties where the tax is not in effect, the county commissioners with the concurrence of the governing bodies of two-thirds (2/3) of the municipalities may establish the initial term of the tax at two (2) years.

                  <p>However in those counties where the tax is not in effect, the county commissioners with the concurrence of the governing bodies of fifty percent (50%) of the municipalities may establish the initial term of the tax at four (4) years. The term of the tax shall be stated in the proposition submitted to the voters.

                  <p>(I) If the proposition was for less than the full amount authorized in W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i), this subparagraph shall not prohibit a separate proposition for the remaining authorized amount of the tax as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(II) If the proposition was to increase the amount of the tax originally adopted by the electors, the defeat of the proposition to increase the amount of the tax shall not repeal the proposition originally adopted by the electors.</p>
                  <p>(E) If the proposition is approved by the qualified electors or under subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, the board of county commissioners shall by ordinance impose an excise tax upon retail sales of tangible personal property, admissions and services.

                  <p>In lieu of the requirements of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph providing for the submission of the proposition at subsequent elections, the tax authorized under W.S. 39-15- 204(a)(i) may be continued by an election or by a resolution as provided in this subparagraph. For the tax to be continued by an election, the county commissioners, with the concurrence of the governing bodies of fifty percent (50%) of the municipalities, shall submit a proposition to the voters establishing the term of the tax as permanent. The proposition under this subparagraph shall be submitted in the same manner as a proposition to impose the tax under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph provided that the proposition shall be submitted as a separate question at the same election with a proposition to impose or continue the tax under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. The tax may be continued by resolution, subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
                  <p>(I) The tax shall be initially imposed following approval of the electorate in accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(II) The tax shall be continued if favorably supported by a resolution adopted by the governing body of the county and by ordinances adopted by the governing bodies of at least a majority of the incorporated municipalities within the county;</p>
                  <p>(III) Ordinances under this subparagraph shall conform with subdivisions (E)(I) through (V) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(IV) Excise taxes shall be continued under this subparagraph only if the county clerk has certified to the county treasurer that a sufficient number of ordinances or resolutions to continue the tax under this subparagraph have been adopted at least ninety (90) days prior to the election to determine the continuation of the tax. Within five (5) days of receipt of such certification from the county clerk, the county treasurer shall notify the department of revenue of this tax. If the tax is not continued pursuant to this subparagraph it shall be subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph for continuation;</p>
                  <p>(V) The tax may be terminated in the same manner as it was continued under subdivisions (II) and (IV) of this subparagraph except that ordinances and resolutions shall be for the rescinding of the tax. If the tax is continued under subdivisions (II) and (IV) of this subparagraph, it may also be terminated by an election to rescind the tax conducted subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D) of this paragraph. (ii) The following provisions apply to imposition of the lodging excise tax under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii):</p>
                  <p>(A) The tax on lodging services authorized by W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii) shall be in addition to and not in lieu of the tax authorized by W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) and (iii) if both taxes are imposed. If the proposition to impose a tax on lodging services within the county is approved in accordance with subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a city or town shall not impose a lodging tax in addition to the county wide tax even though the additional tax does not exceed the limitation established under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii);</p>
                  <p>(B) No tax shall be imposed under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii) until the proposition to impose the taxes is submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the county or of a city or town if the proposition is to impose the tax only city wide or town wide, and a majority of those casting their ballots vote in favor of imposing the taxes. If a county seeks to increase a tax rate previously approved by the qualified electors of the county, that increase shall be separately proposed and voted upon, provided that the total amount of the separate propositions is subject to the limitations specified in W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii). A county may impose both taxes authorized in W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) and (ii), but the proposition to impose each tax shall be individually stated and voted upon. Except as otherwise provided, excise taxes imposed under this paragraph shall commence as provided by W.S. 39-15-207(c) following the election approving the imposition of the tax;</p>
                  <p>(C) The proposition to impose an excise tax shall be at the expense of the county and be submitted to the electors of the county upon the receipt by the board of county commissioners of a petition requesting the election signed by at least five percent (5%) of the electors of the county or of a resolution approving the proposition from the governing body of the county and the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county.

The election shall be at the direction and under the supervision of the board of county commissioners;</p>

A notice of election shall be given in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the election is to be held or in the city or town if only a city wide or town wide tax is proposed, and the notice shall specify the object of the election. The notice shall be published at least once each week for a thirty (30) day period preceding the election. At the election the ballots shall contain the words "for the county (or city or town) lodging tax" and "against the county (or city or town) lodging tax". If the proposition is approved the same proposition shall be submitted at subsequent general elections as provided in this subparagraph until the proposition is defeated. If the proposition to impose the lodging tax pursuant to W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii) is approved, the same proposition shall be submitted, until defeated, at the second general election following the election at which the proposition was initially approved and at the general election held every four (4) years thereafter. If a county, city or town has in place a lodging tax pursuant to W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii), either through a petition or by request of the county, city or town, the proposition posed at the next election may contain a larger tax not to exceed four percent (4%);</p>

                  <p>(E) If the proposition to impose or continue the tax is defeated the proposition shall not again be submitted to the electors of the county for at least eleven (11) months.

                  <p>(F) If the proposition is approved by the qualified electors the board of county commissioners, city council or town council, as appropriate, shall by ordinance impose an excise tax upon the sales price for lodging services. Following approval of a proposition to impose the tax, the county, city or town shall within thirty (30) days following certification of the election results and annually thereafter each year the tax is in effect, notify the department of revenue of the ordinance or resolution imposing the lodging tax and shall submit a list to the department of all persons selling lodging services within their respective jurisdiction. The board of county commissioners or the city or town council shall adopt an ordinance for the tax authorized by this paragraph. The ordinance shall include the following:</p>
                  <p>(I) A provision imposing an excise tax on every sale of lodging services within the county, city or town at the rate approved by the qualified electors, whichever is appropriate;</p>

                  <p>(IV) A provision that the county, city or town, as appropriate, shall contract with the department prior to the effective date of the county sales tax ordinances whereby the department shall perform all functions incident to the administration of the sales tax ordinances of the county, city or town;</p>
                  <p>(V) A provision that the amount subject to the tax shall not include the amount of any sales tax imposed by the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(G) No person shall be liable for payment of the tax imposed under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(ii) for any sale of lodging services made more than one (1) year prior to the date he is notified by the department of revenue of his liability for the tax.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The following provisions apply to imposition of the specific purpose excise tax under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(iii):</p>
                  <p>(A) Before any proposition to impose the tax or incur the debt shall be placed before the electors, the governing body of a county and the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county shall adopt a resolution approving the proposition, setting forth a procedure for qualification of a ballot question for placement on the ballot and specifying how excess funds shall be expended;</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 1/1/2021 this subparagraph will read as:</p>
                  <p>Before any proposition to impose the tax or incur the debt shall be placed before the electors, the governing body of a county and the governing bodies of at least fifty percent (50%) of the incorporated municipalities within the county shall adopt a resolution approving the proposition, setting forth a procedure for qualification of a ballot question for placement on the ballot and specifying how excess funds shall be expended;</p>
                  <p>(B) The revenue from the tax shall be used in a specified amount for specific purposes authorized by the qualified electors. Specific purposes may include one (1) time major maintenance, renovation or reconstruction of a specifically defined section of a public roadway and may include, in conjunction with another specific purpose, funding a reserve account as provided in subparagraph (H) of this paragraph. Specific purposes shall not include ordinary operations of local government except those operations related to a specific project or as authorized by subparagraph (H) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(C) No tax shall be imposed under this paragraph until the proposition to impose the tax for specific purposes in specific amounts is approved by the vote of the majority of the qualified electors voting on the proposition. The amount of revenue to be collected and the purpose or purposes for which it is proposed to be used shall be specified in the proposition. The election shall be held in accordance with W.S. 22-21-101 through 22-21-112. Any debt created may also be repaid, in whole or in part, by a property tax levy if general obligation bonds are authorized by the electors. If a county seeks to increase a tax rate previously approved by the qualified electors of the county that increase shall be separately proposed and voted upon, provided that the total amount of the separate propositions is subject to the limitations specified in W.S. 39-15-204(a)(iii) and (iv). Any excise tax imposed under this subsection shall commence as provided by W.S. 39-15-207(c) following the election approving the imposition of the tax, except that it shall commence on the first day of any subsequent month following the receipt of tax funds in the approved amount by any tax previously imposed under this subsection as provided by subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. Unless terminated earlier by the sponsoring entities pursuant to subparagraph (G) of this paragraph, the relevant portion of the tax shall terminate as provided by W.S. 39-15-207(c) when the amount approved by the electors is collected;</p>
                  <p>(D) No debt may be incurred or approved which when added to the existing indebtedness of the sponsoring entity or entities, would exceed the constitutional debt limitation of the sponsoring entity or entities. However, nothing herein prohibits the approval of a proposition which establishes a fund for accumulation of funds sufficient to carry out the purpose approved or to pay a sufficient amount of the cost so as to bring the remainder of the debt within the debt limitation of the sponsoring entity or entities;</p>
                  <p>(E) Upon certification of the election results by the county clerk to the treasurer, the county treasurer shall, within ten (10) days, notify the department of revenue of the requirement for imposition of any tax under this subsection and shall, upon the estimated collection of all tax funds in the amount approved, notify the department of revenue that the special sales tax levy is terminated. When determining the point in time in which to terminate the tax, the county treasurer in consultation with the department shall estimate future receipts of tax collections to minimize excess collection. The county treasurer shall make his best effort to ensure that sufficient money is collected while minimizing any excess collection. In no event shall the action or inaction of the county treasurer or the department be deemed to prohibit the collection of the full amount of the tax approved by the voters. The department of revenue shall, upon notification, inform all holders of sales tax licenses within the county of the requirement for the collection and payment of the additional tax. After receipt of notice that the amount has been collected or that the sponsoring entities have terminated the tax pursuant to subparagraph (G) of this paragraph, the department shall notify the license holders of the termination of the tax;</p>
                  <p>(F) The first county imposing the tax provided by this act shall be responsible for payment of costs incurred by the department to initially set up computer records and support systems for administration of this tax. These costs shall be withheld by the department from the proceeds to be distributed pursuant to the preceding paragraph until such costs are fully recovered;</p>
                  <p>(G) The sponsoring entities may agree to terminate the tax if the tax collected reaches the actual cost of the completed projects and the amount specified in the proposition exceeds the actual cost of the completed projects. The sponsoring entities shall inform the department of revenue and the county treasurer that the tax is terminated;</p>
                  <p>(H) If approved in the resolution adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and approved by the qualified electors pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, a specified amount of revenue from the tax or the tax revenue from a specified period not to exceed the specified amount may be deposited into a reserve account. Funds in the reserve account may be invested as provided in W.S. 9-4-831 and may be expended for specific purposes previously authorized under this paragraph and for the ordinary operations of local government. A reserve account under this paragraph may be designated as a maintenance and sinking fund for a specific project or projects and the earnings and principal amount in the fund may be expended for the applicable project or projects. A reserve account under this paragraph may be designated as an inviolate account to constitute a permanent or perpetual trust fund which shall be invested in a manner to obtain the highest return possible consistent with preservation of the corpus. Any earnings from investment of the corpus of a permanent or perpetual trust fund designated under this subsection shall be deposited in a separate account and may be expended as authorized in this subparagraph.</p>

If a resort district seeks to increase a tax rate previously approved by the district voters that increase shall be separately proposed and voted upon, provided that the total amount of the separate propositions is subject to the limitations specified in W.S. 39-15-204(a)(v);</p>
                  <p>(B) The tax may be terminated by a resolution to rescind the tax adopted by the board of the resort district.</p>
                  <p>(v) The following provisions apply to imposition of the excise tax under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(vi) the purpose of which is economic development:</p>

                  <p>(iv) If a nonresident subcontractor contracts with a general or prime contractor and posts with the department a surety bond deemed sufficient by the department conditioned upon payment when due of all sales taxes in the performance of the contract, the withholding provisions of W.S. 39-15-303(b)(ii) do not apply;</p>
                  <p>(v) Whenever a nonresident general or prime contractor or nonresident subcontractor furnishes a surety bond for the faithful performance of his contract or subcontract there is imposed an additional obligation upon the surety company to the state of Wyoming and the department as its agent that the nonresident contractor shall pay all sales taxes which become due in the performance of the contract. In the case of a nonresident general or prime contractor this additional obligation includes liability to pay the department all sales taxes which have not been paid to a licensed vendor or the department by the nonresident contractor. The nonresident general or prime contractor or his surety company is authorized to recover from the nonresident subcontractor the amount of sales taxes accruing with respect to purchases made by the nonresident subcontractor which were paid to the department by the nonresident contractor or the surety company, or an amount equal to the sales taxes so paid by the nonresident contractor may be withheld from payments made under the contract. The liability of the surety company under this section is limited to three percent (3%), plus the increased rate under W.S. 39-16-104(b) if the tax under that section is in effect, of the contract price;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Six (6) months after the completion of the contract and the acceptance of the work and services performed, the additional obligation upon the surety company ceases unless written notice of unpaid sales taxes is given the surety company by the department.</p>

                  <p>(a) A certified service provider shall be deemed the agent of a seller, with whom the certified service provider has contracted, for the collection and remittance of sales and use taxes. As the seller's agent, the certified service provider shall be liable for any sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it processes for the seller except as set out in this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) A seller that contracts with a certified service provider shall not be liable to the state for sales or use tax due on any transaction processed by the certified service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud. In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller shall not be subject to any audit on the transaction processed by the certified service provider. A seller shall be subject to audit for any transaction not processed by the certified service provider. The member states acting jointly may perform a system check of the seller and review the seller's procedures to determine if the certified service provider's system is functioning properly and the extent to which the seller's transactions are being processed by the certified service provider.</p>
                  <p>(c) A person that provides a certified automated system is responsible for the proper functioning of that system and is liable to the state for underpayments of tax attributable to errors in the functioning of the certified automated system. A seller that uses a certified automated system shall remain responsible and is liable to the state for reporting and remitting tax.</p>
                  <p>(d) A seller that has a proprietary system for determining the amount of tax due on a transaction and has signed an agreement establishing a performance standard for that system is liable for the failure of the system to meet the performance standard.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any seller of tangible personal property, admissions or services which are subject to taxation under chapter 15 or 16 of this title who does not have a physical presence in this state shall remit sales tax and follow all applicable procedures and requirements of this chapter as if the seller had a physical presence in this state once the seller meets either of the following requirements for the current calendar year or the immediately preceding calendar year:</p>
                  <p>(i) The seller's gross revenue from the sale of tangible personal property, admissions or services delivered into this state exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00); or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The seller sold tangible personal property, admissions or services delivered into this state in two hundred (200) or more separate transactions.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department may bring an action in this state to obtain a declaratory judgment that the obligation of the seller to remit sales tax under subsection (a) of this section is applicable and valid under state and federal law.</p>
                  <p>(c) The filing of a declaratory judgment action under subsection (b) of this section operates as an injunction during the pendency of the action prohibiting the department or any other state entity from enforcing the obligation in subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section against any seller who does not affirmatively consent or otherwise remit sales tax on a voluntary basis.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a court has entered a judgment against a seller or otherwise lifted or dissolved an injunction under this section, the department shall assess and apply the obligation under subsection (a) of this section from the date the judgment is entered or the injunction is lifted with respect to that seller.</p>
                  <p>(e) A seller complying with this section voluntarily or pursuant to an action brought under this section may seek a recovery of taxes, penalties or interest by following the procedures established in this chapter. No claim for a refund or recovery of taxes, penalties or interest shall be granted on the basis that the seller lacked a physical presence in this state and complied with this section voluntarily while under the protection of an injunction granted under this section. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the ability of a seller to obtain a refund or recovery of taxes, penalties or interest for any other reason including mistake of fact or a miscalculation of the applicable tax.</p>
                  <p>(f) No seller who remits sales tax voluntarily or otherwise under this section shall be liable to any person who claims that the sales tax has been over collected if any provision of this act is later deemed unlawful.</p>
                  <p>(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the obligation of any purchaser in this state to remit use tax for any applicable transaction.</p>

The vendor shall collect the tax and give the purchaser a receipt therefor displaying the tax paid separately;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Persons making first use of taxable services or storing, using or consuming tangible personal property or specified digital products are liable for the tax imposed by this article. Specified digital products are only subject to the tax imposed by this article as specified in paragraph (a)(i) of this section.

Specified digital products are only subject to the tax imposed by this article as specified in paragraph (a)(i) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(vii) If any vendor discontinues his business or sells his stock of goods he shall make a final return and payment within thirty (30) days thereafter. His successor in business shall withhold from the purchase price an amount equal to any taxes, penalty or interest due until the time the former owner produces a receipt from the department showing that all amounts due have been paid or a certificate that no taxes are due. If the successor fails to withhold from the purchase price the amount due he is liable for same;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Any tax due under this article constitutes a debt to the state from the persons who are parties to the transaction and is a lien from the date due on all the property of those persons. The tax lien shall have preference over all liens except any valid mortgage or other liens of record filed or recorded prior to the date the tax became due. When the tax is collected by a retailer or his agent, the tax lien has the same status as sales tax liens under W.S. 39-15-108(d)(i).</p>

                  <p>(a) Audits. To assess credits and deficiencies against taxpayers and vendors, the department is authorized to rely on final audit findings made by the department of audit, taxpayer information, vendor information or department review subject to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Audits shall commence when the taxpayer or vendor receives written notice of the engagement of the audit. The issuance of the written notice of the audit shall toll the statute of limitations provided in W.S. 39-16-110 for the audit period specified in this subsection. The audit shall be completed by the department of audit with final findings issued to the taxpayer or vendor within one (1) year of the date of the notice of engagement. This time limit may be extended only upon mutual agreement between the taxpayer or vendor and the department;</p>
                  <p>(ii) After receiving notice of an audit under this subsection, the taxpayer or vendor shall preserve all records and books necessary to determine the amount of tax due for the time period that is being audited;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, audits shall encompass a time period not to exceed three (3) years immediately preceding the reporting period when the audit is engaged. The three (3) year limit shall not apply to an audit if:</p>
                  <p>(A) There is evidence of a violation of paragraph (c)(iv) of this section by the taxpayer or vendor for the reporting period being audited; or</p>
                  <p>(B) There is evidence of gross negligence by the taxpayer or vendor in reporting or remitting taxes for the reporting period being audited.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a taxpayer is not willing or able to produce adequate records to demonstrate taxes due, the department or the department of audit may project taxes based on the best information available. If a vendor is not willing or able to comply with the record requirements of W.S. 39-15-108(c)(xi), the department or the department of audit may project taxes based on the best information available;</p>
                  <p>(v) Audits under this subsection are subject to the authority and procedures provided in W.S. 9-2-2003.</p>
                  <p>(b) Interest. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Interest on amounts due under W.S. 39-16-107 shall be at one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof from the date the return was due until paid. Effective July 1, 1994, interest at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer during the preceding fiscal year plus four percent (4%) shall be added to the delinquent tax. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate on delinquent taxes shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year following the year in which the taxes first became delinquent. In no instance shall the delinquent tax rate be greater than eighteen percent (18%) from any sale made on or after July 1, 1994. The interest rate on any delinquent tax from any sale made before July 1, 1994, shall be one percent (1%) per month from the date the return was due until paid;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The department may credit or waive interest imposed by this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause.</p>
                  <p>(c) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If any part of the deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this article or rules and regulations, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the deficiency shall be added in addition to interest. If any part of the deficiency is due to fraud or an intent to evade this article or authorized rules and regulations, a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the deficiency shall be added in addition to interest;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person liable for the tax imposed by this article neglects or fails to file a return the department shall make an estimate of the total taxable sales and taxes due from the best information available, adding a penalty of ten percent (10%) and interest as provided by paragraph (i) of this subsection from the date the taxes were due until paid. If the neglect or refusal is due to fraud or an intent to evade the provisions of this article a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) shall be added in addition to interest;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If any person neglects or refuses to pay the tax imposed by this article the department shall compute the amount due based on the best information available, adding a penalty of ten percent (10%) and interest as provided by paragraph (i) of this subsection from the date the taxes were due until paid. Payment of the tax, penalty and interest imposed by this paragraph relieves the vendor from payment;</p>
                  <p>(iv) When the department has reason to believe the tax imposed by this article will be jeopardized by delay it shall immediately levy a jeopardy assessment which is immediately due and payable. If the jeopardy assessment is not paid within ten (10) days following notice thereof a delinquency penalty and interest as imposed by paragraph (ii) of this subsection shall be added;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the taxes, penalty and interest due under this section are unpaid within ten (10) days following service of notice an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) and interest as provided by paragraph (i) of this subsection shall be added by the department;</p>

                  <p>(vii) The department may bring an action to recover any delinquent taxes, penalty or interest in any appropriate court within three (3) years following the delinquency. In the case of an assessment created by an audit, the delinquency period is deemed to start thirty (30) days after the date the assessment letter is sent. Any Tax penalty and interest related to the audit assessment shall be calculated from the filing period during which the deficiency occurred. In such action a certificate by the department is prima facie evidence of the amount due;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Any person who violates W.S. 39-16-107(b)(i) or (vi) is guilty of a misdemeanor;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Any person who violates W.S. 39-16-102(c) is guilty of a misdemeanor;</p>

                  <p>(xii) Any person who files a false or fraudulent return is subject to the provisions of W.S. 6-5-303;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Upon request of the department, the attorney general may institute proceedings to restrain and enjoin any person from:</p>
                  <p>(A) Acting as a vendor until they have received a license as required by W.S. 39-15-106;</p>
                  <p>(B) Continuing to act as a vendor if they have not remitted to the department, when due, all taxes, penalty and interest imposed by this article.</p>
                  <p>(xiv) W.S. 39-15-108(b)(ii), (c)(iv) and 39-15-107(b)(iv) apply to use taxes under this article;</p>
                  <p>(xv) The department may impose a penalty of ten dollars ($10.00) upon any vendor who fails to file his return in a timely manner as required by W.S. 39-16-107(a) provided the vendor files his return within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the department pursuant to paragraph (xii) of this subsection. The department may impose a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) upon any vendor who fails to file his return within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the department pursuant to paragraph (xii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) The department, for good cause, may waive a penalty imposed for failure to file a return provided that the taxpayer requests the waiver in writing within ninety (90) days after the due date, setting forth the reasons for the late filing;</p>
                  <p>(xvii) The department may credit or waive penalties imposed by this subsection as part of a settlement or for any other good cause;</p>
                  <p>(xviii) Notwithstanding W.S. 39-16-102(c), if any vendor or taxpayer is one hundred fifty (150) days or more delinquent on taxes due under this article, has not entered into a formal payment arrangement with the department and after thirty (30) days notice provided by first class mail, the department shall post monthly the name of the vendor or taxpayer, the sales and use tax license number, physical address and the unpaid balance owed by the vendor or taxpayer on the website of the department indicating that the vendor or taxpayer has not paid the tax due under this article.</p>
                  <p>(d) Liens. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any tax due under this article constitutes a debt to the state from the persons who are parties to the transaction and is a lien from the date due on all the property of those persons. The tax lien shall have preference over all liens except any valid mortgage or other liens of record filed or recorded prior to the date the tax became due. When the tax is collected by a retailer or his agent, the tax lien has the same status as sales tax liens under W.S. 39-15-108(d)(i);</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person is delinquent in the payment of taxes, penalty or interest imposed by this article, the department may give notice of the amount of the delinquency to any person having in their possession or control credits or personal property belonging to the delinquent taxpayer or owing debts to him at the time of the notice. No person so notified shall transfer or make any disposition of the credits, personal property or debts unless the department approves of the disposition or until sixty (60) days has elapsed from the receipt of the notice. Each person receiving a notice under this paragraph shall advise the department within five (5) days after receiving the notice of all credits or personal property in their possession or under their control which belong to the delinquent taxpayer or of debts owed him;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Upon a failure to pay the tax due upon any vehicle as provided by this section, the county treasurer shall notify the department which may file a lien against the vehicle as provided by this subsection and shall note the lien on the title of the vehicle.</p>
                  <p>(e) Tax sales. At any time following a delinquency the department with board approval may seize and sell at public auction any property owned by the delinquent taxpayer to pay all taxes, penalty and interest due plus the cost involved in seizing and selling the property. Notice of the sale showing its time and place shall be mailed to the delinquent taxpayer at least ten (10) days prior to the sale. The notice shall also be printed in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county wherein the seized property is to be sold at least ten (10) days prior to the sale. If no newspaper is published in the county the notice shall be posted in three (3) public places ten (10) days prior to the sale. The notice shall contain a description of the property to be sold, a statement of the entire amount due, the name of the delinquent taxpayer and a statement that unless the amount due is paid on or before the time of sale, the property or so much thereof as necessary shall be sold. The department, with board approval, shall give the purchaser a bill of sale for personal property or a deed for real property purchased at the sale. Any unsold property seized may be left at the sale at the risk of the delinquent taxpayer. If the monies received at the sale are in excess of the amount due the excess shall be given to the delinquent taxpayer upon his receipt therefor. If a receipt by the delinquent taxpayer is not given the department shall deposit the excess with the state treasurer as trustee for the delinquent taxpayer.</p>

                  <p>(a) Interpretation requests. There are no specific applicable provisions for interpretation requests for this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) Appeals. Except as provided by this subsection, no person who feels aggrieved by the payment of the taxes, penalty and interest imposed by this article may appeal a decision of the board until all taxes, penalty and interest have been paid. For good cause shown, the court to which the decision of the board is appealed may stay enforcement of the board's order assessing and levying the tax during the pendency of the appeal. The court's stay of enforcement shall not affect the accruing of interest upon any assessment and levy.</p>
                  <p>(c) Refunds. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any tax, penalty or interest which has been erroneously paid, computed or remitted to the department by a vendor shall on department approval be credited against any subsequent tax liability from the payee or may be refunded. If a vendor erroneously collects taxes from a taxpayer and remits those taxes to the department, the vendor may seek a refund or credit against subsequent tax liability only after the vendor has refunded the erroneously collected tax to the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor. If the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor cannot be identified, the tax shall not be refunded or credited to the vendor. No credit or refund shall be allowed after three (3) years from the date of overpayment. The receipt of a claim for a refund by the department shall toll the statute of limitations. All refund requests received by the department shall be approved or denied within ninety (90) days of receipt. Any refund or credit erroneously made or allowed may be recovered in an action brought by the attorney general in a court of competent jurisdiction in Laramie county, Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(d) Credits. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any tax, penalty or interest which has been erroneously paid, computed or remitted to the department by a vendor shall on department approval be credited against any subsequent liability from the payee or may be refunded. If a vendor erroneously collects taxes from a taxpayer and remits those taxes to the department, the vendor may seek a credit against subsequent tax liability or a refund only after the vendor has refunded the erroneously collected tax to the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor. If the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor cannot be identified, the tax shall not be credited or refunded to the vendor. Any refund or credit erroneously made or allowed may be recovered in an action brought by the attorney general in a court of competent jurisdiction in Laramie county, Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxpayer or vendor is entitled to receive an offsetting credit for any overpaid excise tax identified by an audit that is within the scope of the audit period, without regard to the limitation period for requesting refunds. This paragraph shall not apply to any tax which was erroneously collected from a taxpayer and remitted by a vendor unless the auditor can determine that the erroneously collected taxes have been refunded to the taxpayer that originally paid the tax to the vendor;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department shall allow a credit for sales tax legally imposed and paid to another state on a purchase equal to but not exceeding the liability for use tax under this article on that purchase. The department may require that any claim for a credit be substantiated in writing showing the sales tax paid.</p>
                  <p>(e) Redemption. There are no specific applicable provisions for redemption for this article.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>39-16-111. Distribution.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) License fees and interest collected by the department pursuant to this article shall be transferred to the state treasurer who shall credit them to the general fund. All penalties collected by the department under this article shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited as provided in W.S. 8-1-109, except the total sum of penalties collected by the department and paid to the state treasurer shall be allocated based upon the ratio of each county's population to the population of the state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Revenues earned under this article during each fiscal year shall be recognized as revenue during that fiscal year for accounting purposes. Revenue collected by the department from the taxes imposed by this article shall be transferred to the state treasurer who shall, as specified by the department:</p>
                  <p>(i) Credit sixty-nine percent (69%) for deposit by the state treasurer to the general fund except as provided by subsections (d) and (e) of this section and less any credit allowed pursuant to W.S. 39-16-107(b)(viii);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Deduct from the remaining share, one percent (1%) to cover all administrative expenses and costs attributable to the remaining share and credit for deposit by the state treasurer into the general fund for that amount;</p>
                  <p>(iii) From the remaining share, until June 30, 2004, deduct an amount equivalent to one-half percent (0.5%) and thereafter deduct an amount equivalent to one percent (1%) of the tax collected under W.S. 39-16-104. From this amount, the department shall distribute until June 30, 2004, five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and thereafter ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) annually to each county in equal monthly installments and then distribute the remainder to each county in the proportion that the total population of the county bears to the total population of the state. The remainder shall then be paid monthly to the treasurers of the counties, cities and towns for payment into their respective general funds. The percentage of the remainder that will be distributed to each county and its cities and towns will be determined by computing the percentage that net use taxes collected attributable to vendors in each county including its cities and towns bear to total net use taxes collected of vendors in all counties including their cities and towns. The distribution shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) To each county in the proportion that the population of the county situated outside the corporate limits of its cities and towns bears to the total population of the county including cities and towns;</p>
                  <p>(B) To each city and town within the county in the proportion the population of the city or town bears to the population of the county.</p>
                  <p>(c) In addition to the distribution in subsection (b) of this section, until June 30, 2004, twenty-nine and one-half percent (29.5%) and thereafter thirty-one percent (31%) of use taxes accruing from out-of-state vendors shall be distributed to counties, cities and towns in the same percentage as determined in paragraph (b)(iii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) If any person commences after the effective date of this act to construct an industrial facility, as that term is defined in W.S. 35 12 102, under a permit issued pursuant to W.S. 35 12 106, or if the federal or state government commences to construct any project within this state with an estimated construction cost as specified in the definition of industrial facility in W.S. 35 12 102 the department of revenue shall thereafter pay to the county treasurer and the county treasurer will distribute to the county, cities and towns of that county in which the industrial facility or project is located, impact assistance payments from the monies available under paragraph (b)(i) of this section. Each payment to the county treasurer shall be equal to an amount determined by the industrial siting council under this subsection and shall continue during the period of construction except that in the case of an industrial facility or a federal or state government project which is expected to continue in phases for an indefinite period of time, the department of revenue shall discontinue payments under this section when construction of any phase has ceased or been substantially completed for twelve (12) consecutive months. The person constructing the industrial facility and the counties affected by the construction of the industrial facility shall provide evidence at the public hearing held pursuant to W.S. 35 12 110(f)(i) of the mitigated and unmitigated impacts that the construction will have on the counties, cities and towns determined by the industrial siting council to be affected by the construction of the industrial facility. The industrial siting council shall review the evidence of the impacts and determine, applying a preponderance of evidence standard, the dollar amount of the unmitigated impacts. The council shall state, in the order issued under W.S. 35 12 113(a), the total dollar amount of the impact assistance payment and the reasons for determining that amount. The impact assistance payment shall be distributed by the department of revenue in an amount and on a schedule determined by the council, based on evidence presented at the hearing. Under no circumstances shall the impact assistance payment exceed two and seventy six hundredths percent (2.76%) of the total estimated material costs of the facility, as those costs are determined by the council. The impact assistance payments shall be distributed to the county treasurer and the county treasurer will distribute to the county and to the cities and towns therein based on a ratio established by the industrial siting council during a public hearing held in accordance with W.S. 35 12 110(f)(i). The industrial siting council shall review the distribution ratio for construction projects on a regular basis and make appropriate adjustments. A governing body which is primarily affected by the facility, or any person issued a permit pursuant to W.S. 35 12 106, may petition the industrial siting council for review and adjustment of the distribution ratio or the amount of the impact assistance payment upon a showing of good cause. The impact assistance payment shall be in addition to all other distributions under this section, but no impact assistance payment shall be made for any period in which the county or counties are not imposing at least a one percent (1%) tax authorized by W.S. 39 15 204(a)(i) and 39 16 204(a)(i) or at least a total of a two percent (2%) sales tax authorized under W.S. 39 15 204(a)(i), (iii) and (vi) and at least a total of a two percent (2%) use tax authorized under W.S. 39 16 204(a)(i), (ii) and (v). For purposes of this subsection, the industrial facility or federal or state government project will be deemed to be located in the county in which a majority of the construction costs will be expended, provided that upon a request from the county commissioners of an adjoining county to the industrial siting council, the council may determine that the social and economic impacts from construction of the industrial facility or federal or state government project upon the adjoining county are significant and establish the ratio of impacts between the counties and certify that ratio to the department of revenue who will thereafter distribute the impact assistance payment to the counties pursuant to that ratio. The industrial siting council shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) As used in subsection (d) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Period of construction" begins at the commencement of construction and ends when the physical components of the industrial facility or federal or state government project are ninety percent (90%) complete, and provided, if payments are already being made under this act, commencement of construction of another industrial facility or federal or state government project will not be considered for purposes of establishing a new impact assistance payment amount or determining when payments will commence under this act, but will only be considered for determining when the period of construction ends;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 107, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(f) Vendors shall annually provide the department information indicating the amount of tax under this article collected from purchases of propane, butane, liquefied gas and compressed natural gas. Upon verification by the department, the state treasurer shall annually transfer from the revenues deposited pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) of this section to the state highway fund ten percent (10%) of the amount collected under this article on purchases of propane, butane, liquefied gas and compressed natural gas. This transfer of revenue replaces highway revenues existing prior to the enactment of this act.</p>

                  <p>(h) Taxes collected under subsections W.S. 39-16-107(b)(ii) and (iii) of this section shall be remitted in full by the county treasurer to the department monthly or as required by the department together with reports as required by the department. County treasurers shall be reimbursed monthly in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the amount remitted to the department in the preceding month for deposit into the county general fund.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state preempts the field of imposing tax upon sales and storage, use and consumption of tangible personal property as provided by this article. No county, city, town or other political subdivision may impose, levy or collect taxes upon sales or storage, use or consumption of tangible personal property except as provided in this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to the state tax imposed under article 1 of this chapter a county or a resort district may impose excise taxes as specified under this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) Whenever a county or resort district imposes an excise tax on retail sales of tangible personal property, admissions and services made within the county or resort district pursuant to article 2, chapter 15 of this title, the county or resort district shall also impose an excise tax at the same rate on sales made in the county or resort district and storage, use and consumption of tangible personal property in the county or resort district. The purpose of the tax is for general revenue.</p>
                  <p>(d) No tax shall be imposed under subsection (c) of this section unless the requirements of W.S. 39-16-203 have been satisfied. Satisfaction of the requirements of W.S. 39-16-203 authorizes and requires the imposition of an excise tax under this section at the same rate as the excise tax under article 2 of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(e) A county imposing a sales tax pursuant to W.S. 39-15-203(a)(iii), or a resort district imposing a sales tax pursuant to W.S. 39-15-203(a)(iv), is authorized and required to impose a corresponding use tax at the same rate and for the same period of time as for the sales tax.</p>
                  <p>(f) The administration of the county or resort district use taxes is vested in the department which may prescribe forms and rules and regulations for making returns and for the ascertainment, assessment and collection of the taxes. The department shall keep complete records of all monies received and disbursed by it.</p>
                  <p>(g) No applicant to the state of Wyoming for grant or loan funds shall be penalized for failure to enact the tax provided in W.S. 39-16-204(a)(ii).</p>

                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The following provisions apply to imposition of the general purpose excise tax under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(i):</p>
                  <p>(A) Except as provided by subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, no tax shall be imposed under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(i) until the proposition to impose the taxes is submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the county, and a majority of those casting their ballots vote in favor of imposing the taxes. If a county seeks to increase a tax rate previously approved by the qualified electors of the county that increase shall be separately proposed and voted upon, provided that the total amount of the separate propositions is subject to the limitations specified in W.S. 39-16-204(a)(i) and (iii). A county may impose both taxes authorized in W.S. 39-16-204(a)(i) and (ii), but the proposition to impose each tax also shall be individually stated and voted upon. Except as otherwise provided, excise taxes imposed under this paragraph shall commence as provided by W.S. 39-16-207(c) following the election approving the imposition of the tax;</p>
                  <p>(B) The proposition to impose an excise tax shall be at the expense of the county and be submitted to the electors of the county upon the receipt by the board of county commissioners of a petition requesting the election signed by at least five percent (5%) of the electors of the county or of a resolution approving the proposition from the governing body of the county and the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county. If proposed by petition by electors, the number of electors required shall be determined by the number of votes cast at the last general election. The election shall be at the direction and under the supervision of the board of county commissioners;</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 1/1/2021 this subparagraph will read as:</p>
                  <p>The proposition to impose an excise tax shall be at the expense of the county and be submitted to the electors of the county upon the receipt by the board of county commissioners of a petition requesting the election signed by at least five percent (5%) of the electors of the county or of a resolution approving the proposition from the governing body of the county and the governing bodies of at least fifty percent (50%) of the incorporated municipalities within the county. If proposed by petition by electors, the number of electors required shall be determined by the number of votes cast at the last general election. The election shall be at the direction and under the supervision of the board of county commissioners;</p>
                  <p>(C) The proposition may be submitted at an election held on a date authorized under W.S. 22-21-103.

                  <p>(A) of this paragraph providing for the submission of the proposition at subsequent elections, the tax authorized under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(i) may be continued subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>

                  <p>(IV) Excise taxes shall be continued under this subparagraph only if the county clerk has certified to the county treasurer that a sufficient number of ordinances or resolutions to continue the tax under this subparagraph have been adopted at least ninety (90) days prior to the election to determine the continuation of the tax. Within five (5) days of receipt of such certification from the county clerk, the county treasurer shall notify the department of revenue of this tax. If the tax is not continued pursuant to this subparagraph it shall be subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph for continuation;</p>
                  <p>(V) The tax may be terminated in the same manner as it was continued under subdivisions (II) and (IV) of this subparagraph except that ordinances and resolutions shall be for the rescinding of the tax. If the tax is continued under subdivisions (II) and (IV) of this subparagraph, it may also be terminated by an election to rescind the tax conducted subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D) of this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The following provisions apply to imposition of the specific purpose excise tax under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(ii):</p>
                  <p>(A) Before any proposition to impose the tax or incur the debt shall be placed before the electors, the governing body of a county and the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county shall adopt a resolution approving the proposition, setting forth a procedure for qualification of a ballot question for placement on the ballot and specifying how excess funds shall be expended;</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 1/1/2021 this subparagraph will read as:</p>
                  <p>Before any proposition to impose the tax or incur the debt shall be placed before the electors, the governing body of a county and the governing bodies of at least fifty percent (50%) of the incorporated municipalities within the county shall adopt a resolution approving the proposition, setting forth a procedure for qualification of a ballot question for placement on the ballot and specifying how excess funds shall be expended;</p>
                  <p>(B) The revenue from the tax shall be used in a specified amount for specific purposes authorized by the qualified electors. Specific purposes may include one (1) time major maintenance, renovation or reconstruction of a specifically defined section of a public roadway and may include, in conjunction with another specific purpose, funding a reserve account as provided in subparagraph (H) of this paragraph. Specific purposes shall not include ordinary operations of local government except those operations related to a specific project or as authorized by subparagraph (H) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(C) No tax shall be imposed under this subsection until the proposition to impose the tax for specific purposes in specific amounts is approved by the vote of the majority of the qualified electors voting on the proposition.</p>
                  <p>The amount of revenue to be collected and the purpose or purposes for which it is proposed to be used shall be specified in the proposition. The election shall be held in accordance with W.S. 22-21-101 through 22-21-112. Any debt created may also be repaid, in whole or in part, by a property tax levy if general obligation bonds are authorized by the electors.

                  <p>Provided, any excise tax imposed under this subsection shall commence as provided by W.S. 39-16-207(c) following the election approving the imposition of the tax, except that it shall commence on the first day of any subsequent month following the receipt of tax funds in the approved amount by any tax previously imposed under this subsection as provided by subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. Unless terminated earlier by the sponsoring entities pursuant to subparagraph (G) of this paragraph, the relevant portion of the tax shall terminate as provided by W.S. 39-16-207(c) when the amount approved by the electors is collected;</p>
                  <p>(D) No debt may be incurred or approved which when added to the existing indebtedness of the sponsoring entity or entities, would exceed the constitutional debt limitation of the sponsoring entity or entities. However, nothing herein prohibits the approval of a proposition which establishes a fund for accumulation of funds sufficient to carry out the purpose approved or to pay a sufficient amount of the cost so as to bring the remainder of the debt within the debt limitation of the sponsoring entity or entities;</p>
                  <p>(E) Upon certification of the election results by the county clerk to the treasurer, the county treasurer shall, within ten (10) days, notify the department of revenue of the requirement for imposition of any tax under this subsection and shall, upon the estimated collection of all tax funds in the amount approved, notify the department of revenue that the special sales tax levy is terminated. When determining the point in time in which to terminate the tax, the county treasurer in consultation with the department shall estimate future receipts of tax collections to minimize excess collection. The county treasurer shall make his best effort to ensure that sufficient money is collected while minimizing any excess collection. In no event shall the action or inaction of the county treasurer or the department be deemed to prohibit the collection of the full amount of the tax approved by the voters. The department of revenue shall, upon notification, inform all holders of sales and use tax licenses within the county of the requirement for the collection and payment of the additional tax. After receipt of notice that the amount has been collected or that the sponsoring entities have terminated the tax pursuant to subparagraph (G) of this paragraph, the department shall notify the license holders of the termination of the tax;</p>
                  <p>(F) The first county imposing the tax provided by this act shall be responsible for payment of costs incurred by the department to initially set up computer records and support systems for administration of this tax. These costs shall be withheld by the department from the proceeds to be distributed pursuant to the preceding paragraph until such costs are fully recovered;</p>
                  <p>(G) The sponsoring entities may agree to terminate the tax if the tax collected reaches the actual cost of the completed projects and the amount specified in the proposition exceeds the actual cost of the completed projects. The sponsoring entities shall inform the department of revenue and the county treasurer that the tax is terminated;</p>
                  <p>(H) If approved in the resolution adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and approved by the qualified electors pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, a specified amount of revenue from the tax or the tax revenue from a specified period not to exceed the specified amount may be deposited into a reserve account. Funds in the reserve account may be invested as provided in W.S. 9-4-831 and may be expended for specific purposes previously authorized under this paragraph and for the ordinary operations of local government. A reserve account under this paragraph may be designated as a maintenance and sinking fund for a specific project or projects and the earnings and principal amount in the fund may be expended for the applicable project or projects. A reserve account under this paragraph may be designated as an inviolate account to constitute a permanent or perpetual trust fund which shall be invested in a manner to obtain the highest return possible consistent with preservation of the corpus. Any earnings from investment of the corpus of a permanent or perpetual trust fund designated under this subsection shall be deposited in a separate account and may be expended as authorized in this subparagraph.</p>

                  <p>(A) The tax shall be imposed if favorably supported by a resolution adopted by the board of the resort district and approved by a majority of the district voters under W.S. 18-16-119. If a resort district seeks to increase a tax rate previously approved by the district voters that increase shall be separately proposed and voted upon, provided that the total amount of the separate propositions is subject to the limitations specified in W.S. 39-16-204(a)(iv);</p>
                  <p>(B) The tax may be terminated by a resolution to rescind the tax adopted by the board of the resort district.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The following provisions apply to imposition of the excise tax under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(v) the purpose of which is economic development:</p>
                  <p>(A) No tax shall be imposed under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(v) until the proposition to impose the tax is submitted to the vote of the qualified electors of the county, and a majority of those casting their ballots vote in favor of imposing the taxes. If a county seeks to increase a tax rate previously approved by the qualified electors of the county that increase shall be separately proposed and voted upon, provided that the total amount of the separate propositions is subject to the limitations specified in W.S. 39-16-204(a)(iii) and (v).</p>
                  <p>Except as otherwise provided, excise taxes imposed under this paragraph shall commence as provided by W.S. 39-16-207 following the election approving the imposition of the tax;</p>
                  <p>(B) The proposition to impose an excise tax shall be at the expense of the county and be submitted to the electors of the county upon the receipt by the board of county commissioners of a petition requesting the election signed by at least five percent (5%) of the electors of the county or of a resolution approving the proposition from the governing body of the county and the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county.

                  <p>(a) Licenses and permits. There are no specific applicable provisions for licenses and permits for this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) Bonding. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) To secure payment of use taxes by nonresident prime contractors, each nonresident contractor shall file with the department of revenue a surety bond or legal security equal to three percent (3%), plus the increased rate under W.S. 39-16-104(b) if the tax under that section is in effect, of the payments due under the contract or an amount determined by the department. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of all use taxes which become due and payable to this state under the contract or in the real property development. This bond requirement does not apply for a nonresident contractor who has furnished a surety bond as provided by paragraph (v) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any person a party to or performing work on a contract under this section may be enjoined from commencing or continuing any work until an approved bond has been filed with the department. Such an action shall be brought in the name of the state by the attorney general or by a district attorney. The state is not required to post security in seeking a restraining order or preliminary injunction under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In lieu of filing the bond or security required under paragraph (i) of this subsection, a nonresident contractor may file and maintain with the department a surety bond or legal security in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of all use taxes which become due and payable to this state under any of the contractor's contracts or in any of the contractor's real property developments in this state. A nonresident contractor electing to file a bond or security under this subsection shall maintain it until he is no longer required to file any bond or security under this article or until a bond or security is filed under paragraph (i) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If a nonresident subcontractor contracts with a general or prime contractor and posts with the department a surety bond deemed sufficient by the department conditioned upon payment when due of all use taxes in the performance of the contract, the withholding provisions of W.S. 39-16-303(b)(ii) do not apply;</p>
                  <p>(v) Whenever a nonresident general or prime contractor or nonresident subcontractor furnishes a surety bond for the faithful performance of his contract or subcontract there is imposed an additional obligation upon the surety company to the state of Wyoming and the department as its agent that the nonresident contractor shall pay all use taxes which become due in the performance of the contract. In the case of a nonresident general or prime contractor this additional obligation includes liability to pay the department all use taxes which have not been paid to a licensed vendor or the department by the nonresident contractor. The nonresident general or prime contractor or his surety company is authorized to recover from the nonresident subcontractor the amount of use taxes accruing with respect to purchases made by the nonresident subcontractor which were paid to the department by the nonresident contractor or the surety company, or an amount equal to the use taxes so paid by the nonresident contractor may be withheld from payments made under the contract. The liability of the surety company under this section is limited to three percent (3%), plus the increased rate under W.S. 39-16-104(b) if the tax under that section is in effect, of the contract price;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Six (6) months after the completion of the contract and the acceptance of the work and services performed, the additional obligation upon the surety company ceases unless written notice of unpaid use taxes is given the surety company by the department.</p>

                  <p>(b) Interest. The license taxes and penalty shall be collected by the department together with interest of one percent (1%) per month on the license taxes from the due date until payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Penalties. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any person who conducts the business of a supplier, refiner, distributor, terminal operator, importer, exporter or dealer without holding a valid license as specified in W.S. 39-17-106 is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as provided in paragraph (vii) of this subsection. Each day in violation of the provisions of this section constitutes a separate offense;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If any person fails or refuses to file the monthly statement and remit the tax as provided by W.S. 39-17-107(a)(i), the department shall make a statement for that person from the best information available and from such statement shall determine the amount of license taxes required to be paid and add thereto a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the taxes due. The department shall notify the delinquent taxpayer of the total amount due by serving written notice upon such person personally or by United States mail to the last known address as shown on the records of the department. If the delinquent taxpayer proves to the department that the delinquency was due to a reasonable cause, the department shall waive the penalty provided in this paragraph. If the delinquent taxpayer after receiving the statement prepared by the department later renders to the department a true statement covering the same calendar month, the department shall use such statement, adding the penalty of ten percent (10%) and interest of one percent (1%) per month on the license taxes from the due date until payment. The penalty shall be waived by the department upon satisfactory written proof the delinquency was due to a reasonable cause;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any person who fails to furnish any report or remit any license tax to the department as required by this article is guilty of a misdemeanor. Each offense is punishable as provided in paragraph (vii) of this subsection. In addition, the department may suspend or revoke any license held by the offender and may require the offender, as a condition of any future licensing under this article, to provide a surety bond, cash bond or certificate of deposit as provided by W.S. 39-17-106(e);</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any supplier, refiner, terminal operator, importer, exporter or distributor selling gasoline subject to the license taxes imposed by this article while delinquent in the payment of any such taxes is liable for double the amount due to be recovered in a suit instituted by and in the name of the state of Wyoming.

                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is levied and shall be collected a license tax on all diesel fuels used, sold or distributed for sale or use in this state except for those fuels exempted in W.S. 39-17-205;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 46, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iii) A terminal operator or bulk plant operator may rely on the representation made by the purchaser of motor fuel or the purchaser's agent concerning the destination state of the motor fuel. A purchaser is liable for any tax due as a result of the purchaser's diversion of fuel from the represented destination state;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any user not otherwise required to be licensed and report the tax levied pursuant to this section under the provisions of W.S. 39-17-207 or 39-17-206 shall be required to be licensed and report all taxes due under this section pursuant to the provisions of W.S. 39-17-206 and 39-17-207.</p>
                  <p>(b) Basis of tax. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state of Wyoming preempts the field of imposing taxes upon sales and use of diesel fuels and no city, town or county may levy or collect taxes upon the sales or use of diesel fuels;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxes imposed on diesel fuel shall be conclusively presumed to be a direct tax on the ultimate or retail consumer. When taxes are paid by any person other than the ultimate or retail consumer, the payment shall be considered as precollected and as an advance payment for the purpose of convenience and facility to the consumer and shall thereafter be added to the price of the diesel fuel and recovered from the ultimate or retail consumer, regardless of where or how the taxable fuel is ultimately consumed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) When a supplier, distributor, refiner, importer or exporter imports diesel fuel into or exports diesel fuel from the state of Wyoming in the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, the amount of diesel fuel consumed in the vehicles on Wyoming highways shall be deemed to be the product of the total amount of the diesel fuel consumed in his entire operations within and without this state times the total number of miles traveled on the highways within this state divided by the total number of miles traveled within and without the state. In the absence of mileage records, the department may by rule promulgated pursuant to W.S. 39-17-202(a) adopt the mileage basis for determining the taxable use of diesel fuel used in those motor vehicles which travel regularly over prescribed courses on and off the highways within the state of Wyoming. In the absence of records showing the number of miles actually operated per gallon of diesel fuel consumed, it shall be presumed that not less than one (1) gallon of diesel fuel was consumed for every four (4) miles traveled;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A Wyoming licensed supplier, distributor, refiner or importer who is unable to recover the license taxes due from a bulk sale to a licensee who is other than an end-user and is not owned, rented or leased by the supplier, distributor, refiner or importer requesting the credit is not liable for the taxes and may credit the amount of unpaid taxes against a later remittance of taxes required under W.S. 39-17-204(a)(i). The department shall promulgate rules to implement this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(c) Taxpayer. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The taxes imposed on motor fuel shall be conclusively presumed to be a direct tax on the ultimate or retail consumer. When taxes are paid by any person other than the ultimate or retail consumer, the payment shall be considered as precollected and as an advance payment for the purpose of convenience and facility to the consumer and shall thereafter be added to the price of the motor fuel and recovered from the ultimate or retail consumer, regardless of where or how the taxable fuel is ultimately consumed;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A terminal operator, distributor or supplier may rely on the representation made by the purchaser of motor fuel or the purchaser's agent concerning the destination state of the motor fuel. A distributor or supplier is liable for any tax due as a result of the distributor's or supplier's diversion of fuel from the represented destination state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Every person who sells or offers to sell to the retail trade diesel fuels for use in motor vehicles shall conspicuously display a sign stating the price per gallon including all applicable taxes. The provision of this paragraph shall not apply to key lock or card lock fuel dispensing systems.</p>

                  <p>(a) Taxable event. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is levied and shall be collected a license tax on all alternative fuel used, sold or distributed for sale or use in this state except for those fuels exempted under W.S. 39-17-305;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The tax imposed by W.S. 39-17-304(a)(iii) shall cease to be collected on the first day of the third month following the date the department of environmental quality notifies the director of the department of transportation that the balance of the corrective action account created by W.S. 35-11-1424 exceeds seventeen million dollars ($17,000,000.00) and the environmental pollution financial responsibility account created by W.S. 35-11-1427 exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). The tax shall again be collected beginning on the first day of the third month following the date the department of environmental quality notifies the director of the department of transportation that the balance of the corrective action account has fallen below eleven million dollars ($11,000,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) Basis of tax. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state of Wyoming preempts the field of imposing taxes upon sales of alternative fuels used to propel a motor vehicle and no city, town or county may levy or collect taxes upon the sales of alternative fuels to propel a motor vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The taxes imposed on alternative fuel shall be conclusively presumed to be a direct tax on the ultimate or retail consumer. When taxes are paid by any person other than the ultimate or retail consumer, the payment shall be considered as pre-collected and as an advance payment of the purpose of convenience and facility to the consumer and shall thereafter be added to the price of the alternative fuel and recovered from the ultimate or retail consumer, regardless of where or how the taxable fuel is ultimately consumed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any user not otherwise required to be licensed and report the tax levied pursuant to this section under the provisions of W.S. 39-17-306 or 39-17-307 shall be required to be licensed and report all taxes due under this section pursuant to the provisions of W.S. 39-17-306 and 39-17-307;</p>
                  <p>(iv) When a supplier, distributor, refiner, importer or exporter imports alternative fuel into or exports alternative fuel from the state of Wyoming in the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, the amount of alternative fuel consumed in the vehicles on Wyoming highways shall be deemed to be the product of the total amount of the alternative fuel consumed in his entire operations within and without this state times the total number of miles traveled on the highways within this state divided by the total number of miles traveled within and without this state. In the absence of mileage records, the department may by rule promulgated pursuant to W.S. 39-17-302(a) adopt the mileage basis for determining the taxable use of alternative fuel used in those motor vehicles which travel regularly over prescribed courses on and off the highways within the state of Wyoming. In the absence of records showing the number of miles actually operated per gallon of alternative fuel consumed, it shall be presumed that not less than one (1) gallon, gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) or diesel gallon equivalent (DGE) of alternative fuel was consumed for every four (4) miles traveled;</p>
                  <p>(v) A Wyoming licensed supplier, distributor, refiner or importer who is unable to recover the license taxes due from a bulk sale to a licensee who is other than an end user and is not owned, rented or leased by the supplier, distributor, refiner or importer requesting the credit is not liable for the taxes and may credit the amount of unpaid taxes against a later remittance of taxes required under W.S. 39-17-304(a)(i). The department shall promulgate rules to implement this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(c) Taxpayer. The following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) A terminal operator or bulk plant operator may rely on the representation made by the purchaser of alternative fuel or the purchaser's agent concerning the destination state of alternative fuel. A purchaser is liable for any tax due as a result of the purchaser's diversion of fuel from the represented destination state.</p>

The department shall notify the delinquent taxpayer of the total amount due by serving written notice upon such person personally or by United States mail to the last known address as shown on the records of the department. If the delinquent taxpayer proves to the department that the delinquency was due to a reasonable cause, the department shall waive the penalty provided in this paragraph. If the delinquent taxpayer after receiving the statement prepared by the department later renders to the department a true statement covering the same calendar month, the department shall use such statement, adding the penalty of ten percent (10%) and interest of one percent (1%) per month on the license taxes from the due date until payment.

                <p><shortTitle>39-19-103. Imposition of tax.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Taxable event. A tax is imposed on the transfer of property constituting the Wyoming gross estate of every decedent.</p>
                <p>(b) Basis of tax. The amount of tax is the maximum state death tax credit allowed to a Wyoming estate as a credit against federal estate taxes under the laws of the United States for estate, inheritance, legacy and succession taxes actually paid to the several states times the ratio which the Wyoming gross estate bears to the value of the federal gross estate, or the maximum state death tax credit allowable to a Wyoming gross estate, whichever is greater. W.S. 39-19-101 through 39-19-111 are intended to take full advantage for Wyoming of the credit which is allowed as a deduction from the federal estate tax liability of estates of decedents, for state taxes upon property or transfer thereof by reason of death, without increasing the aggregate of federal and state death, transfer or succession taxes upon any estate.</p>
                <p>(c) Taxpayer. The personal representative of an estate, a portion of which constitutes Wyoming gross estate, shall file with the department a duplicate of all federal estate tax returns and notices required to be made to the federal authorities and pay the Wyoming estate tax to the department. Any tax liability under W.S. 39-19-101 through 39-19-111 becomes, from the time the tax liability is due and payable, a debt of the taxpayer to the state, to be recovered in an action on this title. The attorney general may bring an action at the request of the department in the name of the state to collect any tax liability of any taxpayer under W.S. 39-19-101 through 39-19-111.</p>
