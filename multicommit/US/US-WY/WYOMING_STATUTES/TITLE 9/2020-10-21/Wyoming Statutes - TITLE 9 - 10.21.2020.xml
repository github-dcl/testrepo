                  <p>(c) If the auditor agrees the debt is uncollectible, he shall direct that the debt be discharged and extinguished as an asset or account receivable of the state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The facts and actions which are the basis for the decision that the debt is uncollectible shall be documented in writing and shall be maintained as required under W.S. 9-2-410.</p>
                  <p>(e) Before any billing for services, collections or use of the services of a collection agency, state institutions shall first make an administrative determination that all statutory requirements relative to patient billing have been followed in each case. In the case of those state institutions defined by W.S. 25-11-101(a)(vii), the decision of whether to contract with a collection agency shall be made by the department of health or the department of family services pursuant to W.S. 25-11-106.</p>
                  <p>(f) No patient billing from the state hospital shall be collectible unless:</p>

                  <p>(A) The obligation to pay;</p>

                  <p>(ii) The patient has been provided with a monthly billing statement; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The statutory requirements for the determination of patient billing have been followed.</p>

The interfund loans shall be repaid as soon as the anticipated revenue is received. The total amount of interfund loans under this subsection outstanding at one (1) time shall not exceed sixty million dollars ($60,000,000.00). These loans shall not be used to fund shortages caused by expenditures exceeding projected revenues but are to be used only to fund temporary shortages caused by meeting obligations which come due prior to receipt of revenues. The interest charged on each interfund loan under this subsection, other than to the general fund or budget reserve account, shall be the interest rate earned on pooled fund investments in the previous fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>(b) To the extent the legislature provides for interfund loans or borrowing authority from one (1) agency, account or fund to another, the interfund loan or borrowing shall come out of the legislative stabilization reserve account to be credited to the borrowing agency, account or fund, except as authorized by W.S. 21-13-316. The interest charged on each interfund loan or borrowing from the legislative stabilization reserve account shall be the interest rate earned on pooled fund investments for the fiscal year immediately preceding the effective date of the interfund loan.</p>

The director shall determine the means to be used to verify and validate the performance measures. The results of the reviews shall be reported to the agency head, governor and secretary of state;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Require each county, city and town, special district and joint powers board in this state to report to the department revenues received and expenditures made each fiscal year.

                  <p>The legislature finds that a shortage of primary care physicians and allied health providers exists in the state of Wyoming which limits the availability of adequate health care services for the citizens of the state who live in rural areas. The legislature further finds that the number of qualified physicians and allied health care providers can be increased to enhance the provision of rural health care services by the adoption of incentives to attract more primary care physicians and allied health care providers to communities experiencing these shortages. The legislature therefore enacts the Rural Health Care Act of 1993 to create an office of rural health care and to create a loan repayment program to repay education loans of primary care physicians and allied health care providers who practice for specified periods of time in designated communities which are experiencing shortages.</p>

                  <p>(a) The department of health shall develop a detailed, comprehensive substance abuse control plan for prevention, early intervention and treatment designed to curb alcohol and controlled substance abuse in the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department of health or contractor shall work, to the greatest extent feasible, in collaboration with the University of Wyoming statistical analysis center in determining appropriate data regarding early warning signs of substance abuse.</p>
                  <p>(c) The plan shall also recommend how the services of schools, community mental health centers, social service providers, local health care providers, law enforcement, corrections and any other entities presently available in the state of Wyoming can better serve the state in responding to substance abuse problems. The substance abuse control plan should decrease the potential overlapping of these services while maintaining a collaborative effort among state and local governmental entities and other organizations to assure maximum leveraging of resources, including people and money. The plan should identify and address the filling of gaps in the continuum of needed services. The substance abuse control plan shall also include recommendations to the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the state of Wyoming regarding programs and funding determinations which those entities may make.</p>

                  <p>(iii) If the loan can be repaid with work of greater than four (4) years, within the amount of time the loan could be repaid, plus two (2) years.</p>
                  <p>(f) Qualified work under subsection (e) of this section shall be credited so that the student's loan balance is reduced on the basis of one (1) year of full-time employment repaying the loan balance for one (1) academic year of full-time enrollment, or twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) of the loan, whichever is less.

The total cost of the purchase shall not exceed nine million twenty-six thousand dollars ($9,026,000.00) for capital costs together with funded interest at the rate of two and six hundred thirty-two thousandths percent (2.632%) from December 31, 1968, to the date of the commencement of payments. All costs shall be paid in not more than forty (40) annual installments of principal plus interest at the rate of two and six hundred thirty-two thousandths percent (2.632%) per annum.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the governor executes a contract under subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section, the water development commission may:</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to this section and with the approval of the governing body of the political subdivision, any department, agency, board or individual of any political subdivision may record or copy by any permanent reproductive process approved by the director as required in subsection (c) of this section any public record which the department, agency, board or individual of the political subdivision records, keeps, retains, or is by law, rule or regulation required to record, keep or retain for a period of years or permanently. The permanent reproduction is deemed the original or official copy of the public record so reproduced for all purposes. If any department, agency, board or individual of any political subdivision is required to record any writing or document in books or on other forms, recording done directly onto a permanent storage medium in lieu of the other required form of recordation constitutes compliance with the requirement. One (1) copy shall be made and sent to the director whenever any process is used to reproduce public records with the intent of disposing of the original or copies of the original. One (1) copy of all permanent reproductions shall be retained by the governmental entity or officer having custody of the writings or papers thus recorded or copied as the official copy.</p>
                  <p>(b) If any document is presented for recording or notation in public records the document shall, after recording, be returned to the party from whom it was received. If the party cannot be located or refuses to accept it, the document shall be disposed of in accordance with W.S. 9-2-411.</p>
                  <p>(c) Prior to adopting any reproductive process, the governing body of a political subdivision shall consult with the director. If any of the public records which are reproduced pursuant to this section are permanent records or, under the laws, rules or regulations in effect at the time of reproduction, are required to be transferred at a later date to any agency or department of the state, the reproductive process shall be approved by the director as one which clearly and accurately makes copies that will last the time they are to be kept, or can be subsequently reproduced without distortions that substantially affect their legibility.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the original documents are disposed of as allowed by law, the permanent reproduction retained by the local governmental entity or official shall be stored in a safe place and protected from destruction. Reproductions shall be available to the public for inspection in the same manner as the original documents would have been, and sufficient access shall be available to the public to permit inspection.</p>
                  <p>(e) The clerk of district court shall not reproduce, for official record purposes, the files of any action or proceeding kept in his office until two (2) years have lapsed since the initial filing in the action or proceeding. The clerk of district court may make certified or other copies of documents in his office for individuals or officials.</p>
                  <p>(f) In recording, reproducing or copying any public records as authorized by this section and in disposing of the originals or copies, no restrictions or provisions of law regarding recording, reproducing or copying, or the disposition of originals or copies inconsistent with this section apply to the governmental entity or its officers, agents and employees.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>9-2-1014.2. Budget shortfall measures; expenditure reductions; use of contingent appropriations.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The governor shall periodically review agency budgets and expenditures. If the governor determines during the review that the probable receipts from taxes or other sources of revenue for any fund or account will be less than were anticipated, and if the governor determines that these receipts plus existing revenues in the fund or account which are available will be less than the amount appropriated, the governor, after complying with the provisions of this section, shall give notice to the state agencies concerned and reduce the amount expended to prevent a deficit. In making any determination under this subsection the governor may but need not consider statutory authority to transfer appropriated funds or use a contingent appropriation to address revenue shortfalls. This subsection shall apply to all appropriations to state agencies regardless of whether the appropriation is for a specified project or purpose, including but not limited to capital construction projects. This subsection shall apply whether the appropriation is to be expended directly by an agency or is made to an agency for distribution to another entity.</p>
                  <p>(b) Before any expenditure is reduced pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or if the governor otherwise determines that a shortfall in appropriated funds is likely at any time in a fiscal biennium prior to the convening of the next regular general or budget session of the legislature, the following actions shall be taken:</p>
                  <p>(i) The governor shall notify the chairmen of the joint appropriations committee, the management council of the legislature and the chairmen of the consensus revenue estimating group of any proposed expenditure reduction and any recommended use of a contingent appropriation. The consensus revenue estimating group shall meet as soon as feasible, review its latest official revenue forecast and determine if adjustments should be made to that forecast in light of existing economic conditions;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The management council shall forward to the legislature the proposals and recommendations of the governor and assign review of the proposals and recommendations to various standing committees of the legislature as the council deems appropriate;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The joint appropriations committee shall determine if it should recommend the use of a contingent appropriation to offset any likely budget shortfall for the remainder of the fiscal biennium. In making this determination and any recommendation the committee shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(A) The expenditure reductions that would be required without use of a contingent appropriation and the impact on services provided. The joint appropriations committee shall consider any comments received from any standing committee of the legislature regarding the potential impact on services;</p>
                  <p>(B) The period of time any decline in revenues resulting in the budget shortfall is forecasted to last;</p>
                  <p>(C) The availability of any other existing or projected funds to offset any predicted shortfall;</p>
                  <p>(D) The amount of time before the next regular general or budget legislative session;</p>
                  <p>(E) The percentage of the contingent appropriation needed to be used to ensure a budget shortfall will be alleviated until the end of either the fiscal biennium or the convening of a regular legislative session, as the joint appropriations committee deems in the best interests of the state.</p>
                  <p>(c) The joint appropriations committee shall submit its recommendations to the governor not more than thirty (30) days after receiving notification under this section. After receiving the recommendation the governor may authorize the transfer of any contingent appropriation, subject to any condition placed on the contingent appropriation in the law making the appropriation, to any account or fund as he deems appropriate and to prevent a budget shortfall. The governor shall report all expenditure reductions and uses of contingent appropriations to the joint appropriations committee not later than ten (10) days after his action to implement the expenditure reduction or transfer contingent appropriations.</p>

The compensation and classification plan shall be designed to attract and retain a sufficient quantity of quality employees with competitive compensation based on relevant labor markets for each class of employment. The plan shall be based upon principles of fairness and equity and be administered with sound fiscal discipline. The plan shall utilize both fixed and variable compensation as well as noncash reward and recognition programs. All variable compensation benefits under the plan, except as otherwise provided by law, shall be administered by the department as a separately designated and appropriated budget item. The plan shall consist of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Current job descriptions. These shall describe job content including the nature and level of work performed, responsibilities, requirements to possess professional licenses, certifications or registrations, and assist in job evaluation and classification, pay comparisons with other entities, recruitment, selection and performance appraisal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Job content and classification. This process shall formally assign positions to classifications and determine pay grades in one (1) or more pay systems based on an evaluation of the content of jobs using quantitative point factors.

These factors and their weights shall be established by the human resources division and reflect the relative importance of job content to the state and to the appropriate local, regional, national market or a combination of these markets as determined by the division. Establishing the value of compensation shall be primarily based on establishing the appropriate market value of the job. For positions for which a market value cannot readily be identified, the value of compensation shall be based on a fair and defensible method. Total compensation, including base salary, benefits, lump sum payments, allowances and other variable elements of compensation shall be targeted at a competitive level when compared to the appropriate labor markets to allow the state to attract and retain the quality and quantity of employees needed to fulfill service commitments to its citizens. The human resources division shall periodically audit and update the system to ensure that it reflects current labor market conditions and at the request of the state employee compensation commission shall review applicable department rules and regulations, or through assessing employee complaints analyze hiring difficulties and turnover statistics;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Pay data collection and analysis. Data collection shall be based on a defined and relevant labor market that is representative of public and private sector employers. The relevant labor market may be local, regional, national or a combination of these markets as determined by the division to best reflect the relative importance of a job to the state.</p>
                  <p>Data analysis shall identify salary ranges for each pay grade with minimum and maximum dollar limits. The total compensation package for state employees shall be considered in the data collection and analysis;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Procedures to set and change individual pay rates consistent with subsection (c) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(v) A performance appraisal system. This system shall measure performance in writing as objectively as possible. The system shall relate differences in performance levels and provide a means of employee advancement within classification pay grades. Evaluators shall be trained in performance appraisal prior to assessing the performance of any employee.</p>
                  <p>Evaluators shall be required to attend continuing personnel evaluation education programs as deemed necessary by the human resources division. All employees subject to appraisal may respond to the appraisal of their performance in writing;</p>
                  <p>(vi) When a license, certification or registration is required to perform job duties it shall be included in the position job classification, job advertisement and announcement;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Data collected under this subsection shall be available to the legislature as needed.</p>
                  <p>(c) The state compensation plan shall provide for the following procedures to establish and change individual pay rates:</p>
                  <p>(i) Rates of pay shall be determined using knowledge, skills, abilities, experience, responsibilities, requirements to possess professional licenses, certifications or registrations, and labor market conditions giving consideration to salaries in the public and private sector in the relevant labor market as determined by the division. Rates of pay shall be based on a combination of achievement of performance objectives, recognition of differences in job content, acquisition and application of further knowledge, skills and abilities;</p>
                  <p>(ii) General pay increases shall be only those approved by the legislature;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Pay increases based on performance appraisals shall be approved consistent with the performance appraisal system;</p>

                  <p>(v) Longevity pay increases shall be approved at a rate of forty dollars ($40.00) per month for each five (5) years of service. Longevity pay increases shall not be considered as part of base pay;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Special pay increases may be approved by the governor using available funds.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed by Laws 1989, ch. 52, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any employee who has been paid for accumulated vacation or sick leave upon separation and who is rehired within thirty-one (31) days after separation, shall fully reimburse all payments for accumulated vacation or sick leave within thirty-one (31) days after being rehired with all rights.

                  <p>(iv) Position sharing employees are entitled to a portion, equal to the employee's share of the full-time position, of employee benefits accorded to full-time employees. Benefits which cannot be divided, such as participation in the state group health and life insurance programs, shall be accorded to position sharing employees on the same basis as full-time employees without division, but the state's contribution to the insurance or other benefit programs shall be a portion, equal to the employee's share of the full-time position, of the contribution for full-time employees.</p>
                  <p>(g) The state shall, in accordance with rules promulgated by the human resources division and on behalf of any employee receiving temporary total disability benefits for an injury covered under the Wyoming Worker's Compensation Act and sustained while acting within the scope of employment with the state, for two (2) calendar months following the month in which the injury occurred, pay the employer's contributions to the state group health insurance plan, the state group life insurance plan and to the state retirement system.

                  <p>(j) Designations under paragraph (h)(i) of this section:</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>9-2-1026.8. Interstate Library Compact; enactment; form.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The Interstate Library Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>INTERSTATE LIBRARY COMPACT</p>
                  <p>Article I</p>
                  <p>Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.</p>
                  <p>Article II</p>
                  <p>(a) As used in this compact:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Public library agency" means any unit or agency of local or state government operating or having power to operate a library;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Private library agency" means any nongovernmental entity which operates or assumes a legal obligation to operate a library;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Library agreement" means a contract establishing an interstate library district pursuant to this compact or providing for the joint or cooperative furnishing of library services.</p>
                  <p>Article III</p>
                  <p>(a) Any one (1) or more public library agencies in a party state in cooperation with any public library agency or agencies in one (1) or more other party states may establish and maintain an interstate library district. Subject to the provisions of this compact and any other laws of the party states which pursuant hereto remain applicable, such district may establish, maintain and operate some or all of the library facilities and services for the area concerned in accordance with the terms of a library agreement therefor. Any private library agency or agencies within an interstate library district may cooperate therewith, assume duties, responsibilities and obligations thereto, and receive benefits therefrom as provided in any library agreement to which such agency or agencies become party.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within an interstate library district, and as provided by a library agreement, the performance of library functions may be undertaken on a joint or cooperative basis or may be undertaken by means of one (1) or more arrangements between or among public or private library agencies for the extension of library privileges to the use of facilities or services operated or rendered by one (1) or more of the individual library agencies.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a library agreement provides for joint establishment, maintenance or operation of library facilities or services by an interstate library district, such district shall have power to do any one (1) or more of the following in accordance with such library agreement:</p>
                  <p>(i) Undertake, administer and participate in programs or arrangements for securing, lending or servicing of books and other publications, any other materials suitable to be kept or made available by libraries, library equipment or for the dissemination of information about libraries, the value and significance of particular items therein, and the use thereof;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Accept for any of its purposes under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, (conditional or otherwise), from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and receive, utilize and dispose of the same;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Operate mobile library units or equipment for the purpose of rendering bookmobile service within the district;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Employ professional, technical, clerical and other personnel, and fix terms of employment, compensation and other appropriate benefits; and where desirable, provide for the in-service training of such personnel;</p>
                  <p>(v) Sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Acquire, hold, and dispose of any real or personal property or any interest or interests therein as may be appropriate to the rendering of library service;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Construct, maintain and operate a library, including any appropriate branches thereof;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Do such other things as may be incidental to or appropriate for the carrying out of any of the foregoing powers.</p>
                  <p>Article IV</p>
                  <p>(a) An interstate library district which establishes, maintains or operates any facilities or services in its own right shall have a governing board which shall direct the affairs of the district and act for it in all matters relating to its business. Each participating public library agency in the district shall be represented on the governing board which shall be organized and conduct its business in accordance with provision therefor in the library agreement. But in no event shall a governing board meet less often than twice a year.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any private library agency or agencies party to a library agreement establishing an interstate library district may be represented on or advise with the governing board of the district in such manner as the library agreement may provide.</p>
                  <p>Article V</p>
                  <p>Any two (2) or more state library agencies of two (2) or more of the party states may undertake and conduct joint or cooperative library programs, render joint or cooperative library services, and enter into and perform arrangements for the cooperative or joint acquisition, use, housing and disposition of items or collections of materials which, by reason of expense, rarity, specialized nature, or infrequency of demand therefor would be appropriate for central collection and shared use. Any such programs, services or arrangements may include provision for the exercise on a cooperative or joint basis of any power exercisable by an interstate library district and an agreement embodying any such program, service or arrangement shall contain provisions covering the subjects detailed in article VI of this compact for interstate library agreements.</p>
                  <p>Article VI</p>
                  <p>(a) In order to provide for any joint or cooperative undertaking pursuant to this compact, public and private library agencies may enter into library agreements. Any agreement executed pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall, as among the parties to the agreement:</p>
                  <p>(i) Detail the specific nature of the services, programs, facilities, arrangements or properties to which it is applicable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide for the allocation of costs and other financial responsibilities;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Specify the respective rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the parties;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Set forth the terms and conditions for duration, renewal, termination, abrogation, disposal of joint or common property, if any, and all other matters which may be appropriate to the proper effectuation and performance of the agreement.</p>
                  <p>(b) No public or private library agency shall undertake to exercise itself, or jointly with any other library agency, by means of a library agreement any power prohibited to such agency by the constitution or statutes of its state.</p>
                  <p>(c) No library agreement shall become effective until filed with the compact administrator of each state involved, and approved in accordance with article VII of this compact.</p>
                  <p>Article VII</p>
                  <p>(a) Every library agreement made pursuant to this compact shall, prior to and as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the attorney general of each state in which a public library agency party thereto is situated, who shall determine whether the agreement is in proper form and compatible with the laws of his state. The attorneys general shall approve any agreement submitted to them unless they shall find that it does not meet the conditions set forth herein and shall detail in writing addressed to the governing bodies of the public library agencies concerned the specific respects in which the proposed agreement fails to meet the requirements of law. Failure to disapprove an agreement submitted hereunder within ninety (90) days of its submission shall constitute approval thereof.</p>
                  <p>(b) In the event that a library agreement made pursuant to this compact shall deal in whole or in part with the provision of services or facilities with regard to which an officer or agency of the state government has constitutional or statutory powers of control, the agreement shall, as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the state officer or agency having such power of control and shall be approved or disapproved by him or it as to all matters within his or its jurisdiction in the same manner and subject to the same requirements governing the action of the attorneys general pursuant to paragraph (a) of this article. This requirement of submission and approval shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the requirement of submission to and approval by the attorneys general.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this compact or in any library agreement shall be construed to supersede, alter or otherwise impair any obligation imposed on any library by otherwise applicable law, nor to authorize the transfer or disposition of any property held in trust by a library agency in a manner contrary to the terms of such trust.</p>
                  <p>Article IX</p>
                  <p>(a) Any public library agency party to a library agreement may appropriate funds to the interstate library district established thereby in the same manner and to the same extent as to a library wholly maintained by it and, subject to the laws of the state in which such public library agency is situated, may pledge its credit in support of an interstate library district established by the agreement.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to the provisions of the library agreement pursuant to which it functions and the laws of the states in which such district is situated, an interstate library district may claim and receive any state and federal aid which may be available to library agencies.</p>
                  <p>Article X</p>
                  <p>Each state shall designate a compact administrator with whom copies of all library agreements to which his state or any public library agency thereof is party shall be filed. The administrator shall have such other powers as may be conferred upon him by the laws of his state and may consult and cooperate with the compact administrators of other party states and take such steps as may effectuate the purposes of this compact. If the laws of a party state so provide, such state may designate one (1) or more deputy compact administrators in addition to its compact administrator.</p>
                  <p>Article XI</p>
                  <p>(a) This compact shall enter into force and effect immediately upon its enactment into law by any two (2) states. Thereafter, it shall enter into force and effect as to any other state upon the enactment thereof by such state.</p>
                  <p>(b) This compact shall continue in force with respect to a party state and remain binding upon such state until six (6) months after such state has given notice to each other party state of the repeal thereof. Such withdrawal shall not be construed to relieve any party to a library agreement entered into pursuant to this compact from any obligation of that agreement prior to the end of its duration as provided therein.</p>
                  <p>Article XII</p>
                  <p>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p>(a) From the funds available for distribution, the division on aging may first retain not more than one percent (1%) to pay allowable expenses of the board. The board may award grants to senior centers throughout the state to support the purposes specified in W.S. 9-2-1212(a)(ii) from remaining funds available for distribution. The division on aging shall disburse grant funds in accordance with awards made by the board under this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding W.S. 9-4-207, unobligated or unencumbered funds retained by the division on aging under this section shall not lapse at the end of a fiscal period and shall remain available for distribution as provided in this section. All funds retained pursuant to this subsection shall be accounted for separately. These funds shall not be required to be distributed pursuant to any grant formula adopted pursuant to this article but shall be available for emergency grants or may be distributed according to a grant formula as determined by the board.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board, in consultation with the division on aging, shall by rule and regulation establish a formula for distribution of funds remaining available for distribution under this section as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Each eligible senior center in the state shall receive the same basic grant of up to thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) annually from the funds available for distribution;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Of the amounts remaining after the basic grants are awarded, the board shall annually award ninety-five percent (95%) for grants to eligible senior centers based on the formula developed by the board in consultation with the division on aging. Funds remaining after the award of grants under this paragraph shall be used for emergency grants based upon rules adopted by the board, in consultation with the division on aging. Rules for emergency grants shall provide procedures and criteria for application for and award of emergency grants. Emergency grants shall be paid only if the center has no other available source of funds for the emergency. No emergency grant shall exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) for any single occurrence.</p>

                  <p>(i) To prevent where possible the filing in court of actions against health care providers and their employees for professional liability in situations where the facts do not permit at least a reasonable inference of malpractice; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) To make possible the fair and equitable disposition of such claims against health care providers as are, or reasonably may be, well founded.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this act:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Health care provider" means a person or facility licensed, certified or otherwise authorized by the law of this state to provide health care in the ordinary course of business or practice of a profession, but does not include a person who provides health care solely through the sale or dispensing of drugs or medical devices;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Malpractice claim" or "claim" means any claim against a health care provider for alleged medical treatment, alleged lack of medical treatment, or other alleged departure from accepted standards of health care which results in damage to the patient;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Panel" means the medical review panel provided for under this act;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Reasonable probability" means a factual basis which might lead a reasonable mind to the conclusion. Where there is evidence in the record and room for two (2) opinions, the conclusion shall be reached honestly and upon due consideration;</p>
                  <p>(v) "Substantial evidence" means relevant and competent evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to make a finding of fact. It may be less than the weight of the evidence, but it shall not be clearly contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. More is required to meet the burden than a mere scintilla of evidence or suspicion of the existence of a fact to be established;</p>
                  <p>(vi) "This act" means W.S. 9-2-1513 through 9-2-1523.</p>

                  <p>(ii) A medical record release form, signed by the claimant, authorizing the panel to obtain access to all health care provider records and information pertaining to the claim and, for the purposes of its consideration of this matter only, waiving any privilege as to the contents of those records. Nothing in the statement may in any way be construed as waiving that privilege for any other purpose or in any other context, in or out of court.</p>
                  <p>(b) The claimant shall submit, within sixty (60) days following receipt of the health care provider's answer as required by subsection (e) of this section, a statement prepared and signed by an expert in the specialty or subspecialty of medical practice at issue, setting forth the basis for the expert's belief that the conduct is believed to constitute a malpractice claim and the evidence currently available to support the expert's opinion.</p>
                  <p>(c) The claim may be amended by filing an amendment not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing date.</p>

                  <p>(a) The panel for each claim reviewed under this act shall consist of two (2) health care providers licensed in this state, two (2) attorneys licensed in this state and one (1) lay person unanimously chosen by the first four (4) members, who is not an attorney, health care provider or an employee of an attorney or health care provider. All panel members shall be residents of this state. If feasible the health care provider members of the panel shall be from the health care provider's profession or specialty. In those cases where the theory of respondeat superior or some other derivative theory of recovery is employed, if feasible one (1) member shall be from the individual health care provider's profession or specialty and one (1) member shall be from the profession or specialty of the health care provider named as employer, master or principal.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within five (5) days of receipt, the director shall notify the state licensing agency of the health care provider involved and the state bar of the filing of the claim. Within fourteen (14) days of notification, the state licensing agency and the state bar shall each provide the director a list of twelve (12) of its members as proposed panelists. To the extent possible, the state licensing agency shall include on the list persons specializing in the same field or discipline as the health care provider against whom the claim is made. The director shall select two (2) from each list to serve as panelists and shall notify the parties and the panel members selected of their selection. The four (4) professional panelists shall unanimously select and appoint one (1) person as a lay panelist. The director shall notify the parties of the name of the lay panelist.</p>
                  <p>(c) At or prior to the hearing, the panel may, by majority vote, select a chairman from among its members to preside over the panel proceedings, or shall request a hearing officer from the office of administrative hearings to preside over the panel proceedings.</p>
                  <p>(d) If, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice of selection of the professional panelists, the claimant or the health care provider against whom the claim is made files an affidavit stating his belief that a professional panelist selected by the director cannot be impartial in reviewing the claim, the panel member is disqualified, and the director shall select another from the list. Each party may disqualify not more than three (3) professional panel members under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) The director may excuse a panelist from serving if the panelist feels his presence on the panel would be inappropriate under the circumstances of the case.</p>
                  <p>(f) When a claim is filed against two (2) or more health care providers, the claim against each health care provider shall be consolidated for hearing unless by stipulation of all parties or at the discretion of the panel, the claims are heard separately.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of this act is to establish a framework whereby the executive branch of state government can be reorganized into a limited number of departments to ensure state resources are effectively and efficiently applied to implement programs and policy established in accordance with law thereby better serving the citizens of Wyoming. This act serves as the basic reorganization act, but each new department of state government as reorganized shall be created by a separate act. These separate acts creating a department establish a procedure under which detailed plans for organization of the department can be developed and submitted for review by the public and final approval by the legislature.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>9-2-1707. Reorganization method; types of transfer.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If a bill to create a department as part of government reorganization is enacted into law:</p>
                  <p>(i) The governor shall, not later than July 1 of the year in which the bill is enacted, appoint a department director. The director and any other staff necessary to assist the director during the transition shall serve in positions and be paid from funds available in the existing budgets of agencies and programs assigned to the department by law or appropriated to the governor's office for reorganization;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Upon his appointment, the director shall become the immediate supervisor of all heads of agencies assigned to the department under a Type 1 transfer. Agency heads assigned under Type 1 transfers retain all rights and privileges under the state compensation and personnel system which existed immediately prior to the appointment of the director. No agency head shall be removed by a director before implementation of a department reorganization plan approved by the legislature but the director may fill vacancies;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The director shall prepare a plan for reorganization of the department which, after approval by the governor, shall be submitted on or before October 15 to the specified interim committees and to the legislature not later than December 1 of the year in which the department is created. All state agencies or departments shall cooperate with and provide all requested information to a department director developing a department reorganization plan under this paragraph. Public hearings regarding the plan shall be conducted by at least two (2) interim committees of the legislature specified in the bill creating the department prior to the succeeding legislative session. The plan, as approved by the legislature through a bill, shall be implemented not later than July 1 of the year in which the plan is approved. The plan shall reflect as much of the following basic structure as practicable:</p>
                  <p>(A) The principal operating unit of a department is a division headed by an administrator;</p>
                  <p>(B) The principal operating unit of a division is a program headed by a manager;</p>
                  <p>(C) The principal operating unit of a program is a section headed by a supervisor;</p>
                  <p>(D) The principal operating unit of a section is a subsection headed by a chief;</p>
                  <p>(E) Departments may establish field offices which combine division, program, section and subsection functions;</p>
                  <p>(F) A council is an advisory body created by specific statutory enactment and appointed to function on a continuing basis for the study of the problems arising in a specified functional or program area of state government and to provide recommendations and policy alternatives;</p>
                  <p>(G) A committee is an advisory body created by or without specific statutory enactment for a limited time to study a specific problem and recommend a solution or policy alternative with respect to that problem. Its existence shall terminate upon the completion of its assignment;</p>
                  <p>(H) A coordinating council is an interdepartmental advisory body created by law to coordinate programs and activities for which one (1) department has primary responsibility but in which one (1) or more other departments have an interest;</p>
                  <p>(J) A commission, unless otherwise required by the state constitution, is a body created by specific statutory enactment within a department or the office of the governor exercising limited quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, or both, independently of the director of the department or the governor.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Except as otherwise specified by law, all boards, commissions, councils or committees associated with an agency, assigned to a department under a Type 1 transfer shall be only advisory upon implementation of the department's reorganization plan. During the transition period, boards, commissions, councils and committees shall retain existing authority for making grants, authorizing programs, rulemaking and for taking final agency action in contested cases, except as otherwise specifically provided in a department reorganization act, but shall have no authority regarding the internal administration of the agency. Any board or commission which grants licenses or permits to engage in a profession or occupation retains full authority to grant, deny or take any other action regarding those licenses or permits as exists under current law.</p>
                  <p>(b) As used in reorganization acts to create departments, the following described transfers have the effects specified:</p>
                  <p>(i) Type 1 transfer-A Type 1 transfer is the transfer of an existing agency or substantially all of the functions and programs of an existing agency to a department. This transfer includes the transfer of all positions, personnel, property and appropriated funds to the department to be used for the purposes specified under existing law until implementation of the legislatively approved reorganization plan. The department is responsible for all the programs and functions of an agency assigned to the department through a Type 1 transfer;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Type 2 transfer-A Type 2 transfer is the transfer of a program or function from an existing agency to a department when that agency is not assigned to the department under a Type 1 transfer and includes the transfer of a program or function from a department to a second department or an existing agency if that agency has not yet been assigned to a department. The positions, personnel, property and appropriated funds associated with the program or function shall not be transferred to or from the department unless specified in the department reorganization plan;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Type 3 transfer-A Type 3 transfer is the transfer of an agency with a primary function of issuing licenses or permits to engage in a profession or occupation to a department. The department shall provide budget, fiscal, administrative and clerical services to any agency requesting these services, but not affect its authority with respect to licensure. The positions, personnel, property and appropriated funds of these agencies shall not be transferred to the department. Any agency requesting the services described in this paragraph shall compensate the department for them at a reasonable rate established by the department. In addition to offering the optional services specified in this paragraph, the department shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) Provide administrative oversight of agency procedures to assure that each agency is in compliance with existing statutes that created the agency and that govern the agency's functions;</p>
                  <p>(B) Provide guidance to agencies in matters pertaining to budget preparation, individual agency administration, personnel and other procedural functions in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the department;</p>
                  <p>(C) Function as a liaison between individual agencies within the department and between agencies and other departments within state government;</p>
                  <p>(D) Review the current practices of each agency and make recommendations to individual agencies which might improve the efficiency of the agency.</p>

                  <p>(B) The contract shall be let to a responsible bidder making the lowest bid except that the contract shall be let to the responsible certified resident making the lowest bid if the certified resident's bid is not more than five percent (5%) higher than that of the lowest responsible nonresident bidder in accordance with W.S. 16-6-102(a).</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the principal representative of an agency determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is not feasible or practical, the principal representative shall submit a written determination to the department.

                  <p>(a) Unless otherwise provided by law, when any state officer or employee is required to travel on overnight trips for official business of the state, he is entitled to receive in addition to transportation expenses as provided by W.S. 9-3-103, lodging expenses, an allowance for meals and incidental expenses and other reimbursable expenses. The lodging and meal and incidental expense allowance shall be as determined by the governor for the state and by the governing body of any other entity using the state rate for that entity, but shall not exceed the published federal travel regulation rates in effect at the time of travel. The meal and incidental expense allowance shall be computed so as to pay seventy-five percent (75%) of the destination rate on the day of departure, one hundred percent (100%) on all interim days of official travel and seventy-five percent (75%) of the previous day's rate on the day of return. Lodging expenses shall be reimbursed up to the amount prescribed in the federal travel regulation as provided in this subsection.

                  <p>(iii) Any reimbursable expenses claimed in excess of fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be supported by original vendor receipts or a sworn statement attesting to the expense, signed under penalty of false swearing by the claimant, and shall be attached to the voucher submitted to the state auditor for payment.</p>
                  <p>(b) Instead of the full meal and incidental expense allowance specified in subsection (a) of this section, the state officer or employee will be reimbursed for actual expenses for meals and gratuities while conducting official business of the state, not to exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the daily meal and incidental expense allowance for the location of the official business if the officer or employee:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is required to travel on a one (1) day trip of twenty-four (24) hours or less during which it is reasonable to assume no sleep or rest is required; or</p>

                  <p>(d) Actual expenses in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (a) of this section may be reimbursed for in-state or out-of-state travel, with the prior approval of the agency director if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Specific prior trip approval has been given by the head of the respective agency if the agency is within the executive branch, the management council for the legislative branch and the chief justice of the supreme court for the judicial branch; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The original itemized vendor receipts supporting amounts claimed for lodging and employee meals and gratuities where the total amount of the meal and gratuity exceeds fifteen dollars ($15.00), accompany the claim submitted to the state auditor for payment. No reimbursement shall be claimed or paid for any alcoholic beverage.</p>
                  <p>(e) Claims for lodging and meal and incidental expense allowance or actual expense reimbursement shall be submitted to the state auditor for payment in the manner and form prescribed by him.</p>
                  <p>(f) This section does not apply to the state transportation and game and fish departments.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any voucher for reimbursement under this section or W.S. 9-3-103 shall be signed and certified under penalty of false swearing pursuant to W.S. 6-5-303.</p>
                  <p>(h) As used in the section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Destination" means the location of the employee at midnight, or if still traveling at midnight, the location where lodging is secured;</p>

                  <p>(i) If common carrier transportation is used, the actual expense not to exceed economy fare charged the general public is reimbursable.

                  <p>(iii) If private vehicle transportation is used, reimbursement shall be as determined by the governor for the state and by the governing body of any other entity, based on a mileage allowance not to exceed the maximum nontaxable rates allowed by the internal revenue service at the time of travel.</p>
                  <p>(A) Repealed By Laws 2001, Ch. 23, § 2.</p>

If any officer, judge or employee, or any retired officer, judge or employee, is receiving compensation or retirement benefits on the effective date of this act which include an additional allowance for longevity or length of service previously authorized, those compensation or retirement benefits shall not be immediately reduced or diminished, but that portion of the compensation or retirement benefits being received on the effective date of this act which is attributable to longevity or length of service allowance shall be reduced or disallowed to the extent it is offset by future increases in salary or retirement benefits authorized by act of the legislature. This subsection does not apply to retirement, health insurance or life insurance benefits, but only to compensation received for length of service.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state of Wyoming and its political subdivisions and school districts may obtain group prepaid plans or insurance for life, health, accident or hospitalization for their employees and for elected officials, except for members of the legislature, and enter into agreements with prepaid plans or insurance companies to provide this coverage. Insurance coverage for school district or board of cooperative educational services employees meeting the definition of employee under W.S. 9-3-203(a)(iv), shall, if elected by the district or board under subsection (e) of this section, be provided through the state employees' and officials' group insurance plan in accordance with W.S. 9-3-202 through 9-3-218. Insurance coverage for retired school district or board of cooperative educational services employees shall, if elected by the board or district under subsection (e) of this section and if the retired employee was continuously covered under the board's or district's insurance plan prior to the election, be provided through the state employees' and officials' group insurance plan in accordance with W.S. 9-3-202 through 9-3-218. If a school district or board of cooperative educational services elects to cease participation in the group insurance plan pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the election shall apply to retired employees of that board or district who are receiving coverage under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) Prepaid plans or insurance shall be procured only from prepaid plans authorized to do business in the state of Wyoming or from insurance companies authorized to do business in the state of Wyoming and under the full jurisdiction of the Wyoming insurance commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon a request in writing from any employee of the state of Wyoming, any covered political subdivision thereof or a participating school district, the state auditor or the proper officer in any political subdivision or school district may deduct from the wages of the employee the amount of the premium which the employee has agreed to pay for the prepaid plans or insurance, and to pay or remit the payment directly to the prepaid plan or insurance company issuing the group plan or insurance.</p>
                  <p>(d) The state and any political subdivision are authorized to utilize a self-insurance program, provided that a defined plan with proper funding is first adopted and the cost of the plan is included in the annual budget and provided the self-insurance program includes any coverage mandated by Wyoming insurance law. Any self-insurance program, including the Wyoming state employees' and officials' group insurance plan, adopted pursuant to this section shall be within the jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner under the provisions of title 26, Wyoming statutes.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any school district or board of cooperative educational services may elect to participate in the state employees' and officials' group insurance plan by filing notification of election with the department of administration and information on a form and in a manner as prescribed by the department. Participation in the plan for any electing board or district shall commence not less than one hundred twenty (120) days following the date on which the board or district filed notification under this subsection and shall be identical to plans and coverage provided other enrollees under this act. The department shall notify the electing board or district of the date on which the board or district is eligible to participate in the state group insurance plan. An election by a board or district to participate in the state group insurance plan under this subsection is irrevocable for a period of five (5) years from the date on which plan participation originally commenced. In addition to all other remedies available to the department, if a district or board withdraws from the state group insurance plan during the period of irrevocability, the department may assess against the withdrawing board or district the amount by which all claims paid on behalf of employees of the board or district exceeds total premiums paid by the board or district and their employees. A board or district may renew its initial participation in the state group insurance plan without interruption upon submitting notification of renewal to the department prior to expiration of the initial five (5) year participation period. Renewal of plan participation shall be irrevocable for an additional period of not less than five (5) years.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any school district or board of cooperative educational services which has elected to participate in the state employees' and officials' group insurance plan under subsection (e) of this section may, upon expiration of the initial five (5) years of plan participation required under subsection (e) of this section, elect to cease participation in the state group insurance plan by filing notification of the election to the department on a form and in a manner prescribed by the department. An election under this subsection shall prohibit the board or district from participation in the state group insurance plan for a period of five (5) years commencing on the date plan participation ceased. Participation in the plan for any board or district electing to cease plan participation under this subsection shall be discontinued on a date determined by the department in consultation with the board or district, but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the date on which the board or district filed notification under this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(f) A participating board of cooperative educational services shall pay to the department the monthly premium established by the department for coverage of each eligible employee of the employer electing to become covered by any portion of the group insurance plan. Additionally, each participating board of cooperative educational services shall pay to the department a monthly amount equal to the lowest premium for nonsupplemental coverage for each eligible employee of the employer not electing to become covered under the nonsupplemental portion of the group insurance plan. For purposes of this subsection an employee shall not be considered as not electing coverage if that employee is covered by other insurance with benefits comparable to or greater than the coverage provided by the least expensive non-supplemental plan available under this act. Monthly premiums shall be at minimum no less than rates assessed for coverage of other enrollees qualified under W.S. 9-3-203(a)(iv), and shall be based upon information reported by the participating board of cooperative educational services to the department, to be in a form and manner prescribed by the department.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to uniform rules and regulations the board prescribes, a member may instead of the service retirement benefits provided in this article, elect one (1) of the following forms of retirement benefits which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which he would otherwise be entitled:</p>
                  <p>(i) A one hundred percent (100%) joint and survivor benefit which provides reduced monthly service retirement benefit payments during the retired member's life and upon his death after retirement continues payments in the same reduced amount to a designated beneficiary during the life of the beneficiary;</p>

                  <p>(iii) A benefit which provides reduced monthly service retirement payments with provision for the continuance of payments for ten (10) years certain and life thereafter. If the retired member dies within ten (10) years after retirement, the remaining guaranteed payments shall be made to his designated beneficiary. This beneficiary may be changed at any time by written notification to the board as provided in subsection (b) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The largest possible benefit for life with no lump sum refund or benefit for anyone else upon the retired member's death;</p>

                  <p>(b) An election of an optional benefit shall be in writing and filed with the system prior to the first benefit payment.

                  <p>(a) If a member dies before retirement under the system, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the member's account plus an additional amount equal to the member's account shall be paid to the member's designated beneficiaries, or in the absence of designated beneficiaries to his estate. If the member is vested, instead of a lump sum payment, a beneficiary may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of the lump sum of any benefit for life which is available to a retired member as provided in this article. A beneficiary, who is the surviving spouse of the deceased member and who elects to receive the actuarial equivalent of the lump sum, as a life benefit may, within eighteen (18) months of the death of the member, elect to receive the lump sum death benefit otherwise provided in this subsection plus interest accumulated on that amount less any payments received by the surviving spouse.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless otherwise provided by the benefit option selected by a member pursuant to W.S. 9-3-420, if any member receiving benefits or his beneficiary receiving retirement benefits under this article dies before the total amount of benefits paid to either the member or his beneficiary or both equals the amount of the member's account at retirement, then the excess, if any, shall be paid to any other named beneficiary, if any, or to the member's estate.</p>
                  <p>(c) A designated beneficiary of a member, by signed affidavit, may request that medical insurance premiums be paid from the member's account balance for a period not to exceed four (4) months after the death of the member or until a benefit option has been elected.</p>
                  <p>(d) For purposes of determining a member's account under subsections (a) through (c) of this section, if a member dies before the member has vested under the system, the member's account shall consist of the contributions and interest that accrue in the manner for which contributions and interest accrue for a member who is vested.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a member initially employed on or after July 1, 2019 who is not vested and is not a current employee at the time of death, which occurs before retirement under the system, only the member's account shall be paid to the member's designated beneficiaries, or in the absence of designated beneficiaries to the member's estate.</p>

In determining mental or physical incapacitation for disability retirement under this section, the board may require physician reports, medical examinations, functional capacity evaluations, vocational examinations and other necessary reports and examinations for purposes of this section. The costs of any functional capacity evaluation, vocational examination or other specialized test required under this subsection shall be paid from the retirement account.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon retirement for a total disability and except as provided under W.S. 9-3-431(f) and 9-3-432(h), a member shall receive a monthly disability retirement benefit for the period of his disability equal to one hundred percent (100%) of his service retirement benefit under this article as if the member was eligible for normal retirement benefits. Upon retirement for a partial disability, a member shall receive a monthly disability retirement benefit for the period of his disability equal to fifty percent (50%) of the normal retirement benefit payable to the member as if the member were eligible for normal retirement benefits. Disability benefits are payable for the life of the member or until the member is no longer disabled.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any employee granted disability retirement under this section shall at the time retirement is granted, elect to receive either the benefit authorized by this section or one (1) of the joint and survivor benefit options specified in W.S. 9-3-420.</p>

                  <p>(a) Once each year during the first five (5) years following retirement of a member for disability under the system, and once in every three (3) year period thereafter, the board may require a member who is not eligible for normal retirement benefits pursuant to W.S. 9-3-415(a) or 9-3-431 to undergo a medical examination by a physician designated by the board or any other examination, test or evaluation determined necessary by the board. If the member refuses to submit to a medical or other examination, test or evaluation, his benefit payments shall be discontinued.</p>
                  <p>(b) If any member receiving a disability benefit under this article is restored to service, the payment of the benefit shall be discontinued, that member shall become a contributing member of the system and all previous years of service credit including the period of the disability retirement, shall be credited to his service for the purpose of determining eligibility under W.S. 9-3-415 or 9-3-431.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a member is restored to service from disability retirement and subsequently discontinues his employment for any reason other than a recurrence of the original disability, or another disability, he is not entitled to any disability benefit.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any member receiving a nonduty-connected total or partial disability benefit who has not reached age sixty (60) shall annually report to the board in a form prescribed by the board, his total earnings for the preceding calendar year from any gainful employment for wages and any worker's compensation benefits. Fifty percent (50%) of the excess of any earnings or benefits over the base pay for the position held at the time of disability shall be deducted, in a manner the board determines, from his disability benefit beginning ninety (90) days following the day the report is due. If any member received a disability benefit for less than twelve (12) months in a calendar year for which earnings were reported, the deduction, if any, shall be determined on a pro rata basis.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any member covered by this article, including an at-will contract employee under W.S. 9-2-1022(a)(xi)(F)(III) or (IV), who terminates his employment or any employee of the agricultural extension service of the University of Wyoming who has not elected to continue to be covered by this article is entitled to a refund of his account. In addition, any member who is entitled to a refund who is an at-will contract employee under W.S. 9-2-1022(a)(xi)(F)(III), shall be entitled to a refund of his account plus any employer matching contributions made by that member. In addition, any member who is entitled to a refund who is an at-will contract employee under W.S. 9-2-1022(a)(xi)(F)(IV), shall be entitled to a refund of his account plus any employer matching contributions made by that member. The refunds shall be made only upon written request to the board. A member may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the system, to have the refund of his account paid directly to an eligible retirement plan as specified by the member. Any member who withdraws from the system under this section shall forfeit all rights to further benefits, employer matching contributions and service credit under the system. Any person who later returns to service covered by this article may redeposit a single lump-sum amount equal to the amount of the contributions withdrawn, together with an amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the benefits to be derived from the redeposit, past employer contributions, the individual's attained age and the benefit structure of the appropriate plan, and upon earning not less than two (2) years service credit, may reestablish his service credits as of the time of withdrawal of his contributions. For service prior to July 1, 2002, any law enforcement member covered under W.S. 9-3-432 may redeposit the amount of contributions withdrawn for service covered under W.S. 9-3-432, in a lump sum, together with interest and the actuarial equivalent of the difference between the benefit provided under W.S. 9-3-415 through 9-3-419 and the benefit provided under W.S. 9-3-432, and upon earning not less than two (2) years service credit, may reestablish his service credit as of the time of withdrawal of his contributions. Any redeposit payment pursuant to this subsection shall be made not later than ten (10) years following the date of reemployment or prior to retirement, whichever first occurs. A member may make a redeposit under this subsection with personal funds or, subject to rules and regulations established by the board, through rollover contributions. Unless received by the system in the form of a direct rollover, the rollover contribution shall be paid to the system on or before sixty (60) days after the date it was received by the member. Unless otherwise permitted by section 401(a)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, forfeitures shall not be applied to increase the benefits that any employee would otherwise receive under the system.</p>
                  <p>(b) No member is entitled to a refund of any contributions if he is employed for a salary by an employer.</p>

                  <p>(a) A member shall submit a written application for benefits to the system before benefits shall begin. The written application for benefits shall be on forms adopted by the board.</p>
                  <p>(b) Benefits are payable the last day of the month following the month in which the member's final contributions and employer contributions are remitted to the system and the member has submitted a complete and accurate application under subsection (a) of this section. Retirement is effective the day following the member's last working day in the system or anytime after that time when the member qualifies under W.S. 9-3-415, 9-3-416 or 9-3-431.</p>
                  <p>(c) Benefit payments under the system shall begin by the later of April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the member reaches age seventy and one-half (70 1/2) years or retires. The member's entire interest in the system shall be distributed over the life of the member or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or the life expectancy of the member and designated beneficiary. If a member dies after distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution prior to the member's death. If a member dies before distribution of benefits has begun, the entire interest of the member shall be distributed within five (5) years of the member's death. The five (5) year payment rule shall not apply to any portion of the member's interest which is payable to a designated beneficiary over the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary and which begins within one (1) year after the date of the member's death. The five (5) year payment rule shall not apply to any portion of the member's interest which is payable to a surviving spouse payable over the life or life expectancy of the spouse which begins not later than the date the member would have reached age seventy and one-half (70 1/2) years. The board may by rule and regulation modify distributions under this section in order to provide minimum distributions required by section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code or as otherwise necessary to retain qualified plan status under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

The employer of the firefighter member may pay any or all of the employee contributions imposed under this subsection. The board may increase the contribution percentage required under this subsection by not more than one percent (1%), as necessary to maintain the actuarial integrity of the account as affected by benefits payable under this section. Payments under this subsection shall be made monthly to the account in accordance with W.S. 9-3-412 and 9-3-413.</p>
                  <p>(b) Normal retirement benefits are payable under this section to any firefighter member who:</p>

                  <p>(e) The normal benefit for a firefighter member under this section is equal to two and one-half percent (2 \xBD%) of the highest average salary, as defined by W.S. 9-3-402(a)(xix)(A), multiplied by the member's years of service credit as a firefighter member.</p>
                  <p>(f) Upon retirement for a partial or total disability as determined and for which the member otherwise qualifies under W.S. 9-3-422, a firefighter member shall receive a monthly disability retirement benefit for the period of qualified disability equal to sixty-five percent (65%) of his salary at the time the disability was incurred. Disability benefits are payable under this subsection for the life of the firefighter member or until the firefighter member is no longer disabled. The firefighter member is subject to reporting, evaluation and excess earnings deduction requirements imposed under W.S. 9-3-423.</p>
                  <p>(g) The firefighter member retirement benefit program established under this section shall be discontinued by the board, and retirement benefits prescribed under this section shall be discontinued, if at any time contributions for all firefighter members required under subsection (a) of this section are not paid monthly to the retirement system when due as required by subsection (a) of this section. Upon termination of benefits under this subsection, the retirement benefits for firefighter members shall revert to and be paid under W.S. 9-3-415 and as otherwise prescribed for general members under this article. The firefighter member retirement program may be reactivated following application to and approval by the board and payment of the required contributions to cover both normal costs and any additional liability accruing during the period of program termination as determined by the system actuary. If benefits are terminated and not reactivated under this subsection, a firefighter member may receive additional benefits in proportion to the additional contributions paid on his behalf under this section, as determined by the system's actuary.</p>
                  <p>(h) Benefits shall not be payable under the system to the extent that they exceed the limitations imposed by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The board shall provide any benefits in excess of the limitations under special pay plans authorized under W.S. 9-3-405(b) to the extent the benefits can be provided and the system retain qualified plan status under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

                  <p>(b) Each employer of a law enforcement officer covered under this article shall pay into the account a contribution equal to eight and six-tenths percent (8.6%) of the salary paid to each of its law enforcement officers covered under this article and may pay into the account any amount of the officer's share of contributions under subsection (a) of this section.

                  <p><shortTitle>9-3-453. Public employee retirement plans; funding; legislative findings; required determinations for benefit increases.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The legislature finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) Wyoming public employee retirement plans' actuarial funding levels are higher than many public employee retirement plans in other states, but as constructed by statute, the Wyoming plans were not intended to and cannot support cost of living or other benefit increases. Numerous indicators support this conclusion;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The ratio of the actuarial value of assets to the actuarial accrued liability, or the "funded ratio" is a standard measure of a plan's funded status at a given point in time. Funded ratios of the various retirement plans were as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) The public employee retirement plan administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 9-3-401 through 9-3-430 had a funded ratio of eighty-four and six-tenths percent (84.6%) as of January 1, 2011, down from eighty-seven and five-tenths percent (87.5%) on January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was eighty and one-tenth percent (80.1%) as of January 1, 2011, an improvement from seventy-five and seven-tenths percent (75.7%) as of January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(B) The Wyoming state highway patrol, game and fish warden and criminal investigator retirement plan administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 9-3-601 through 9-3-620, had a funded ratio of eighty-four and one-tenth percent (84.1%) as of January 1, 2011, down from eighty-seven and four-tenths percent (87.4%) on January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the funded ratio was seventy-nine and four-tenths percent (79.4%) as of January 1, 2011, an improvement from seventy-five and three-tenths percent (75.3%) as of January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(C) The law enforcement plan administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 9-3-401 through 9-3-432, had a funded ratio of ninety-nine and nine-tenths percent (99.9%) as of January 1, 2011, down from one hundred two and two-tenths percent (102.2%) as of January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was ninety-five and three- tenths percent (95.3%) as of January 1, 2011, an improvement from eighty-nine percent (89.0%) as of January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(D) The judicial retirement plan administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 9-3-701 through 9-3-713, had a funded ratio of one hundred eight and five-tenths percent (108.5%) as of January 1, 2011, slightly up from one hundred eight and two-tenths percent (108.2%) on January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was one hundred four and four-tenths percent (104.4%) as of January 1, 2011 an improvement from ninety-five and one-tenth percent (95.1%) as of January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(E) The paid firemen plan B, administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 15-5-401 through 15-5-422, had a funded ratio of one hundred fifteen and seven-tenths percent (115.7%) as of January 1, 2011, down from one hundred sixteen and two-tenths percent (116.2%) as of January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was one hundred eleven and three-tenths percent (111.3%) as of January 1, 2011, an improvement from one hundred two percent (102.0%) as of January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(F) The air national guard firefighters plan administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 9-3-401 through 9-3-431 had a funded ratio of seventy-seven and four- tenths percent (77.4%) as of January 1, 2011. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was eighty and one- tenth percent (80.1%) as of January 1, 2011. 2011 was the first year this plan was isolated for review from the public employees plan under W.S. 9-3-401 through 9-3-430;</p>
                  <p>(G) The paid firemen plan A administered by the Wyoming retirement board under W.S. 15-5-201 through 15-5-209, had a funded ratio of eighty-five and six-tenths percent (85.6%) as of January 1, 2011 down from ninety-one and two-tenths percent (91.2%) as of January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was seventy-eight and nine-tenths percent (78.9%) as of January 1, 2011, an improvement from seventy-six and seven-tenths percent (76.7%) as of January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(H) The volunteer firefighters plan administered by the volunteer fireman's pension board under W.S. 35-9-601 through 35-9-615, had a funded ratio of one hundred four and six-tenths percent (104.6%) as of January 1, 2011, down from one hundred eight and nine-tenths percent (108.9%) as of January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was ninety-eight and six-tenths percent (98.6%) as of January 1, 2011, an improvement from ninety-three and five-tenths percent (93.5%) as of January 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(J) The volunteer emergency medical technician's plan, administered by the volunteer emergency medical technician's pension board under W.S. 35-29-101 through 35-29-112, had a funded ratio of one hundred seventeen and eight-tenths percent (117.8%) as of January 1, 2011, up from eighty-three and six-tenths percent (83.6%) as of January 1, 2010. On a market value of assets basis, the plan's funded ratio was one hundred twenty-nine and five-tenths percent (129.5%) as of January 1, 2011, an improvement from ninety and seven-tenths percent (90.7%) as of January 1, 2010. While the funded ratio has increased, reliance on the improvement as an indication of this plan's financial health would be misplaced as the legislation establishing the plan provided a general fund appropriation of nine hundred seventy-eight thousand two hundred dollars ($978,200.00) to fund the difference between the actuarially determined premium for participation in the plan and the contributions required by law. The contributions required by law are insufficient to support the stated benefits under the plan and no long term external funding source was provided when the plan was established, nor thereafter.</p>
                  <p>(iii) All of the funded ratios specified in paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection, except for the paid firemen's plan A, were calculated with the assumptions of no benefit increases or additional cost-of-living adjustment increases;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Actuarial funded ratios at any single point in time disclose only a portion of the soundness of the retirement plans. Underlying the ratios is an assumed eight percent (8%) investment return (composed of a three and one-half percent (3.5%) inflation rate and a four and one-half percent (4.5%) net real rate of return) on each of the various funds. The average market value returns for the largest plan under the board's administration has been three and sixty-three hundredths percent (3.63%) for the last five (5) years and four and twenty-three hundredths percent (4.23%) for the last ten (10) years, both well below the assumed eight percent (8%). The retirement system's actuary has stated: "Even seemingly minor changes in the assumptions can materially change the liabilities, calculated contribution rates and funding periods." Investment returns of less than one-half (1/2) of the assumed rate is a major deviation from assumptions;</p>
                  <p>(v) Where the current actuarial value of assets is higher than the market value of assets, continued recovery in the investment markets will be needed over the next few years, annual returns in excess of the assumed investment return of eight percent (8.0%), to keep the plans' funded ratios and unfunded actuarial accrued liability relatively stable in the short term;</p>
                  <p>(vi) While investments in markets have been authorized by constitutional amendment for retirement funds and supported by legislative authorization, if annual realized returns are lower than assumed or higher than assumed, the funded ratios are respectively overstated or understated;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The public employee plan administered under W.S. 9-3-401 through 9-3-430 has by far the largest membership as it contains eighty-eight and six-tenths percent (88.6%) of the membership of all public employee retirement plans administered by the Wyoming retirement board. The actuarial funded ratio for this plan has dropped from one hundred thirteen and seventy-seven hundredths percent (113.77%) in 2001 to eighty-four and fifty-nine hundredths percent (84.59%) in 2011, even though the actuarial accrued liability in 2001 was calculated using the maximum cost-of-living adjustment authorized by statute and the 2011 liability was calculated using no cost-of-living liability. In light of the lower funded ratio, the Wyoming retirement board recommended and the Legislature enacted in 2010 a combined employer and employee contribution increase from eleven and twenty-five hundredths percent (11.25%) to fourteen and twelve hundredths percent (14.12%) effective September 1, 2010;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Actuarial funded ratios have fallen over the past decade for all other plans identified in this section, other than the judicial retirement plan. The funded ratio of the volunteer firefighter's plan and the firefighter's plan B have dropped by over fifty (50) percentage points. These decreases were incurred in spite of a change in assumptions from a maximum cost-of-living increase allowed by statute to no cost- of-living increase, except for the paid firemen plan A;</p>
                  <p>(ix) From 1991 through 2008, cost-of-living increases ranging from one percent (1%) to three percent (3%) were provided for eighteen (18) consecutive years in the largest public employee retirement plan, resulting in cumulative increases in an employee's benefit amount ranging from one and three-hundredths (1.03%) for employees first eligible for a cost-of-living adjustment in 2008 to thirty-four percent (34%) for those eligible for a cost-of-living adjustment in 1991;</p>
                  <p>(x) Other benefit increases have been provided by legislation, including a 2001 enactment of an increased benefit multiplier for each year of service in the largest plan, which resulted in an increased cost of over five hundred twenty-one million dollars ($521,000,000.00) through July 1, 2011. An ad hoc increase of three dollars ($3.00) per month per year of service made in the same legislation resulted in over two hundred seventeen million dollars ($217,000,000.00) in increased costs to the plan over the same period;</p>
                  <p>(xi) As of January 1, 2011, it is estimated that over forty (40) years will be required until the largest public employee plan currently administered by the Wyoming retirement board meets a one hundred percent (100%) actuarial funded ratio. Other plans administered by the Wyoming retirement board, volunteer firefighters pension board and volunteer emergency medical technician's pension board have higher or lower funded ratios;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Stability in providing stated benefits is a critical feature of a retirement plan. With large portions of public employee retirement plans invested in markets and with market fluctuations having a significant effect on funded ratios, actuarial funded ratios in excess of one hundred percent (100%) are necessary to maximize stability in providing stated benefits;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) It is the intent of the legislature that all public employee retirement plans be managed to maintain an actuarial funded ratio of not less than one hundred percent (100%) and that the retirement board determine from time to time an appropriate level of funding sufficient to withstand market fluctuations without experiencing reductions below the desired one hundred percent (100%) funding ratio;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) It is the intent of the legislature that cost- of-living increases and changes to multipliers be allowed only in the event that the actuarial funded level for the affected plan remains above one hundred percent (100%), plus the additional percentage the retirement board determines is reasonably necessary to withstand market fluctuations. This determination is to be made for the entire amortization period affected by the change using then current actuarial assumptions.</p>

                  <p>(a) In accordance with the findings specified in W.S. 9-3-453:</p>
                  <p>(i) All plans shall be managed to maintain their actuarial funded ratio at or above one hundred percent (100%) throughout the life of the plan. The actual funded ratio recommended by the board shall provide for an appropriate margin above this funding ratio to allow for market fluctuations above the one hundred percent (100%) base;</p>
                  <p>(ii) No benefit changes, including cost-of-living increases and changes to multipliers, shall be recommended for implementation by the legislature unless the system’s actuaries provide an opinion that the funded ratio of the plan will remain above the funding level set out in paragraph (i) of this subsection throughout the life of the benefit change;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any analysis upon which a proposed benefit change is proposed shall include a decision matrix which shall include the following minimum elements:</p>
                  <p>(A) Consideration of the current actuarial value in relation to current market value of assets;</p>
                  <p>(B) A fully amortized cost over the full applicable term of the benefit increase;</p>
                  <p>(C) Current and expected actuarial funded ratios with and without the increase;</p>
                  <p>(D) A review of assumptions made in determining funded ratios and a review of anticipated funded ratios with differing investment return assumptions;</p>
                  <p>(E) Recognition of potential effects of the increase on plan participants' working and retirement periods;</p>
                  <p>(F) The potential isolation, by establishment of separate accounts, of the liability incurred as a result of the cost of living or other benefit increase;</p>
                  <p>(G) The appropriate level of actuarial funding ratio above one hundred percent (100%) needed to buffer the plan from market fluctuations.</p>
                  <p>(b) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of the board to grant a cost-of-living adjustment as authorized by W.S. 15-5-204.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board shall establish and administer the program for employees in addition to any retirement, pension, benefit or other deferred compensation programs established by the governmental entity. Subject to requirements of this article, any county, city, town or other political subdivision may establish and administer a deferred compensation program separate from the program established under this article. A county, city, town or other political subdivision which wishes to enter into the state program established under this article shall adopt the plan document, provide the program to employees in accordance with this article and be subject to program administration by the board. A county, city, town, other political subdivision of the state or an entity or institution of the state which does not utilize the state auditor's office for payroll services may provide for automatic enrollment of new employees into the state program pursuant to W.S. 9-3-509 and pursuant to the requirements of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any employee may enter into a written agreement with the program or a separate deferred compensation program established by a county, city, town or other political subdivision to defer any part of his compensation for investment as provided by this article or an employee may be automatically enrolled as provided in W.S. 9-3-509 and subsection (a) of this section. The total annual amount deferred may at no time exceed the employee's annual salary under applicable salary schedules or compensation plans.</p>
                  <p>(c) Compensation deferred pursuant to this article shall be included as compensation for the purpose of computing retirement or pension benefits earned by the employee, but the deferred compensation is exempt from state taxation to the same extent as it is exempt from federal income taxes.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board may approve investment of deferred compensation in insurance and annuity contracts or other investment plans upon competitive bidding. No investment plan shall be approved unless the plan is offered by a provider and is subject to rules and regulations of applicable federal and state regulatory agencies. The board may establish an account for the purpose of conducting the daily financial operations of the program and to avoid having to liquidate investments prior to maturity. The funds in this account shall be invested in, and be subject to the same terms and conditions as the pools for investments established under W.S. 9-1-416 and 9-4-831(a)(xxvii).</p>
                  <p>(b) The board may establish by contract the fees for enrolling program participants and servicing participant accounts with providers. Fees shall be established at amounts necessary to maintain the account balance in accordance with W.S. 9-3-507.</p>
                  <p>(c) All compensation deferred pursuant to this article and all earnings thereon shall be held in trust or pursuant to custodial accounts or contracts meeting the requirements of 26 USC 457(g) and for the exclusive benefit of program participants and their beneficiaries. An account is established to be used by the board for depositing deferred compensation and earnings on deferred compensation as necessary to fulfill the requirements of this article. Funds in the account shall be held separately from all other funds and monies held by the state and shall be expended only as provided by this article and pursuant to written agreements entered into under this article. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the financial liability of the state, county, city, town or other political subdivision is limited to the value of the investment plan purchased.</p>

Refunds may be made only upon written request to the board. Any employee who withdraws from the retirement program under this subsection shall forfeit all rights to further benefits, employer contributions and service credit under this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any employee who later returns to service covered under this article may redeposit the amount of the contributions withdrawn, in lump sum, together with interest, and upon earning not less than two (2) years service credit, may reestablish his service credits as of the time of withdrawal of his contributions.

                  <p>(a) Any and all funds accruing from state lands set aside for the benefit or use of any public institution or organization specified in W.S. 9-4-303 shall be deposited in the state treasury.</p>
                  <p>(b) Proceeds from the sale of state lands, mineral royalties and any money designated by the Wyoming constitution or Wyoming statutes as collected shall be transmitted to the state treasurer and credited to the proper accounts within the permanent land fund. As authorized by article 7, section 2 of the Wyoming constitution, thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the mineral royalties received from the lease of any school lands shall be deposited into the school lands mineral royalties account. To the extent constitutionally permissible and notwithstanding any other provision of law, at the end of every fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer to the corpus of each account within the permanent land fund, except the common school account, from the income earned on the corresponding account within the permanent land fund, to the extent available, an amount as provided by this subsection. In determining the amount to be withheld, the state treasurer shall calculate the fiscal year beginning balance and ignore any appropriations made from the account within that fiscal year. For the fiscal year 2000, he shall transfer an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the inflation rate for the previous twelve (12) month period as determined by the department of administration and information multiplied by the beginning balance of each permanent land fund account, except the common school account. At the end of each succeeding fiscal year, the state treasurer shall increase the amount to be multiplied by that year's inflation rate by five percent (5%) until such time as the multiplier reaches one hundred percent (100%) of the inflation rate, and then multiply that amount by the beginning balance of each permanent land fund account, except the common school account.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, rentals for the ordinary use of the state lands, bonuses, interest on purchase money, interest from investment of money in corresponding accounts within the permanent land fund, and any money designated by the Wyoming constitution or Wyoming statutes as collected shall be transmitted to the state treasurer and credited to the proper accounts within the permanent land income fund or to the general fund as provided by the Wyoming Funds Consolidation Act and W.S. 9-4-311.</p>

A separate account shall be kept of the sum received from sale or lease rentals from public lands, which sum shall be segregated by the state treasurer and paid to the county in which the leased or sold public land is located. If any leased or sold land lies in more than one (1) county of the state, each county shall receive a proportional amount of the revenue as the area of the leased or sold public land included within the boundary of the county bears to the total area of the leased or sold public land.</p>

                  <p>(a) Revenues received under W.S. 9-4-601(a)(vi) and (b)(i) shall be credited to a capital construction account. No money shall be expended from the account until the money has been appropriated by the legislature to the state loan and investment board through the normal budget process to be used in the board's discretion for any purpose authorized by this section. The revenues shall be used to finance state revenue bonds as provided by this section. The balance shall be used for the making of loans or grants to incorporated cities and towns, counties and special districts as provided in this section. No loan or grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under the provisions of this section until the loan or grant application has been referred by the board to a state agency for review as determined by the board. The state agency shall provide the board with a written review of any loan or grant application referred to the agency and any other assistance requested by the board. No grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under this section to any county unless the county imposes at least eleven (11) or ninety- one and sixty-seven one-hundredths percent (91.67%) of the available mills authorized by article 15, section 5 of the Wyoming constitution, or unless the county is imposing the optional sales tax authorized under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) or (iii). No grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under this section to any municipality unless the municipality imposes at least seven (7) or eighty-seven and five-tenths percent (87.5%) of the available mills authorized by article 15, section 6 of the Wyoming constitution. No grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under this section to any special district or other lawful entity which imposes less than eighty percent (80%) of any authorized mill levy. The state loan and investment board may waive the taxation requirements imposed by this subsection for good cause shown such as other funding sources, but in no case shall the state loan and investment board authorize any grant to any municipality under this section which does not impose at least two (2) or twenty-five percent (25%) of the available mills authorized by article 15, section 6 of the Wyoming constitution. The state loan and investment board shall grant money as authorized by this section only when the board finds the grant is necessary to:</p>

                  <p>(ii) Comply with a federal or state mandate;</p>

The board may encumber revenues under W.S. 9-4-601(a)(vi) and (b)(i). Any bonds issued under this section, together with any interest accruing thereon and any prior redemption premiums due in connection therewith, are payable and collectible solely out of revenues authorized. The bond holders may not look to any general or other fund for payment of the bonds except the revenues pledged therefor. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness or a debt within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision or limitation. The bonds shall not be considered or held to be general obligations of the state but shall constitute special obligations of the state and the board shall not pledge the state's full faith and credit for payment of the bonds.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided, bonds issued under this section shall be in a form, issued in a manner, at, above or below par at a discount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the principal amount of the bonds, at public or private sale, and issued with recitals, terms, covenants, conditions and other provisions not contrary to other applicable statutes, as may be provided by the board in a resolution authorizing their issuance and in an indenture or other appropriate proceedings.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any bonds issued under this section shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Be of denominations of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or multiples thereof;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be fully negotiable within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, W.S. 34.1-1-101 through 34.1-10-104;</p>

                  <p>(v) Be made payable in lawful money of the United States at the office of the state treasurer or any commercial bank or commercial banks;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Be printed at a place the board determines;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Be additionally secured by a reserve fund created from revenues received under W.S. 9-4-601(a)(vi) and (b)(i) or from the proceeds of the bonds, or both, in an amount determined by the state loan and investment board but not to exceed an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the revenue bonds outstanding.</p>
                  <p>(e) Before any contract is entered into by the state loan and investment board to retain the services of a financial advisor or to sell the bonds to an underwriter, whether by competitive or negotiated bid, a full disclosure of the terms of the contract including fees to be paid shall be submitted to the management council through the legislative service office.</p>
                  <p>(f) Proceeds of state revenue bonds shall be credited to a separate account and may be loaned or granted to local governmental entities as hereafter provided. In determining which local governmental entities receive loans or grants, the state loan and investment board shall give priority to projects in those subdivisions of the state socially or economically impacted directly or indirectly by the development of minerals leased under 30 U.S.C. § 181 et seq. Pending distribution the state treasurer shall invest bond proceeds in a manner which complies with all requirements of the internal revenue service to insure the bonds will remain tax free investments.</p>
                  <p>(g) Not to exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000.00) of the total proceeds of all bonds issued under subsection (b) of this section may be loaned or granted to incorporated cities and towns. Loans or grants shall be made only under the following conditions:</p>

                  <p>(ii) Grants may be made for municipal purposes either standing alone or in conjunction with a loan under paragraph (i) of this subsection. Grants may be applied for by a joint powers board with the approval of the city or town which is a member of the board or by one (1) or more cities or towns and shall not be pledged to be payable over a term of years but shall be distributed within a reasonable time following approval. Grants shall be used to finance not more than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of any portion of a project which is unable to be financed under paragraph (i) of this subsection and projects for street, curb, gutter or storm drainage improvements provided the state loan and investment board may make grants in excess of fifty percent (50%) if the board determines that the applicant or the member cities or towns if the applicant is a joint powers board, either levied at least seven (7) mills for operating expenses including special district levies chargeable against the general city or town levy during the current fiscal year or is imposing the optional tax permitted by W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) or (iii) at the time of the application and is utilizing all other local revenue sources reasonably and legally available to finance the project and:</p>

                  <p>(C) The fifty percent (50%) limitation on grants does not apply to improvements to county or state highways within city or town boundaries unless otherwise required by the state loan and investment board.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repayments of loans under paragraph (i) of this subsection shall be credited to a capital reserve account which shall be available for loans or grants for municipal purposes under paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subsection;</p>

                  <p>Instead of furnishing a surety bond as security for the deposits, a depository may pledge any bonds, debentures and other securities in which the state treasurer may by law invest and in an amount equal, at least, to the maximum amount of money at any time to be deposited with the bank. The bonds, debentures and other securities so pledged shall have a market value at least equal to the amount of the deposit. In addition, any depository may furnish as security for the deposit letters of credit issued by any Federal Home Loan Bank in such form as approved by the state treasurer of Wyoming or pledge conventional first mortgages of Wyoming real estate and notes connected with the mortgages at a ratio of one and one-half to one (1.5:1) of the value of public funds secured by them. A pledge of collateral as security for the deposit of public funds shall be accompanied by a written assignment from the depository vesting legal title thereto to the state and by any other instruments required by the state treasurer. The assignment shall provide that the depository shall pay over deposited public funds and accrued interest thereon to the state treasurer, or his authorized deputy, upon check, order or demand in accordance with this article. The assignment shall also provide that the state has the authority, if the depository defaults, to sell all collateral necessary to realize the full amount of deposited public funds and interest accrued thereon.</p>
                  <p>The interest on bonds, debentures and other securities, so pledged, when paid shall be remitted to the bank so pledging them, as long as it is not in default.</p>

As used in this subparagraph, "established place of business" means a place in this state which is actually occupied either continuously or at regular periods by employees or agents of the entity who are licensed to sell securities in this state and where a large share of the entity's business in this state is actually conducted.</p>

Except for investments by special hospital district boards pursuant to W.S. 35-2-403(d) or county memorial hospitals pursuant to W.S. 18-8-104(d), this policy shall be at least as restrictive with respect to the types of investments authorized as those listed under subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section. The policy shall require that before any person effects any investment transaction on behalf of a political subdivision or offers any investment advice to the governing body of a political subdivision, that person shall sign a statement indicating that he has read the policy and agrees to abide by applicable state law with respect to advice he gives and the transactions he undertakes on behalf of the political subdivision.

The state treasurer and state auditor may contract with other persons with special knowledge in this area to provide the training and may also charge a fee for attendance sufficient to defray the cost of the educational program. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the state auditor and state treasurer from allowing the general public to attend these education programs upon payment of the appropriate fee.</p>
                  <p>(k) In connection with, or incidental to, the issuance or carrying of bonds, but only for the purpose of reducing the amount or duration of payment, interest rate, spread or similar risk, or to result in a lower cost of borrowing, and not for purposes of investment, the state treasurer or treasurer of any political subdivision, municipality or special district of this state and the various boards of trustees and boards of directors of county hospitals, airports, fairs and other duly constituted county boards and commissions may enter into contracts which are determined to be necessary or appropriate to hedge risk or to place the obligation of the bonds, in whole or in part, on the interest rate, cash flow or other basis desired, including, but not limited to, contracts commonly known as interest rate swap agreements, interest rate caps or floors, forward payment conversion agreements, futures or hedge contracts.</p>
                  <p>(m) Any local governmental entity, including the treasurer of any political subdivision, municipality or special district of this state, the various boards of trustees and boards of directors of county hospitals, airports, fairs and other duly constituted county boards and commissions, or their designee, that invests public funds under subsection (a) of this section shall:</p>

                  <p>(A) Submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Act as a fiduciary with respect to the investment of public funds by acting solely in the interest of the public and by acting with the care, skill and caution which a prudent person in a like capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of an activity of like character and purpose. The contracted person shall incur only costs that are appropriate and reasonable and shall act in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the law governing the investment of public funds.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>9-4-1001. Guarantee program for school district bonds.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The state loan and investment board shall administer a school district bond guarantee program in accordance with this section and may promulgate rules to implement it. This program applies to bonds issued by school districts under W.S. 21-13-701 through 21-13-721 on or before November 1, 2001, only. The program is intended to benefit school districts by guaranteeing payment of bonded indebtedness of creditworthy districts by reducing the interest rate at which the bonds may be issued.</p>
                  <p>(b) A school district that seeks the guarantee of bonds under this program shall apply to the board on forms prescribed by the board. The board shall review the application, investigate the applicant district and determine whether to approve the application based upon:</p>
                  <p>(i) The purpose of the bond issue, the district's need for it, including information from the needs assessment under W.S. 21-15-115, whether the district would likely remain within constitutional debt limits after the issue and whether a guarantee under this section would likely result in reduced costs;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The district's financial status and stability;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The status of the accreditation of the district by the department of education;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any other factor relevant to the issue and guarantee of the bonds which are the subject of the application.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board may determine to guarantee bonds under this section and may impose terms, conditions and limits on that guarantee as it finds, in its discretion, are necessary to protect state funds and ensure the viability of the program. In addition, the board may guarantee the refunding of bonds issued on or before November 1, 2001, provided the refunding is not combined with any bonds issued after November 1, 2001. A decision by the board not to guarantee bonds under this section is not subject to judicial review under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act (W.S. 16-3-101 through 16-3-115).</p>
                  <p>(d) As a condition of participating in the bond guarantee program under this section, a school district shall enter into agreements necessary to provide that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state of Wyoming, through the state treasurer, shall assume responsibility for and make all payments to the district's paying agent in the amount necessary to pay principal and interest on the bonds subject to the guarantee;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The district shall deposit funds with the state by a certain date and in a sufficient amount so that the state can make the entire principal and interest payment to the district's paying agent in a timely manner;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the district fails to comply with paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(A) The state shall make the full payment due from funds in the common school account in the permanent land fund available under W.S. 9-4-715(g) for this purpose;</p>
                  <p>(B) To the extent that the district has not deposited sufficient funds with the state to comply with paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the state is deemed to have loaned and the district is deemed to have borrowed those funds subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
                  <p>(I) The loan shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average interest earned on investments of the common school account in the permanent land fund in the four (4) calendar quarters preceding the quarter in which the loan occurred;</p>
                  <p>(II) The loan, including principal and interest, shall be repaid from the district's next major maintenance payments under W.S. 21-15-109 and the next payments from the school foundation program account under W.S. 21-13-313. The loan is not deemed to be a general obligation of the district, and the state shall not require repayment from any source other than as provided in this subdivision;</p>
                  <p>(III) The district may make additional payments on the loan.</p>
                  <p>(C) The state loan and investment board may require the district to modify its fiscal practices and its general operations if the board determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the district will not be able to make future payments required under paragraph (ii) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) This section is repealed effective July 1, 2020.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state loan and investment board shall administer a university revenue bond supplemental coverage program in accordance with this section and may promulgate rules to implement it. This program applies to bonds issued by the University of Wyoming under W.S. 21-17-402 through 21-17-450. The program is intended to benefit the university by providing supplemental coverage for payment of bonded indebtedness of the university thereby reducing the interest rate at which the bonds may be issued.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the university seeks supplemental coverage for its revenue bonds under this program, the university shall apply to the board on forms prescribed by the board following legislative authorization of the university to issue revenue bonds. In no case shall the board approve supplemental coverage for bonds if the sale of the bonds would reduce the ratio of university pledged revenue that is available for debt servicing to the cost of interest and principal payments to a level of less than one (1) to one (1). The board shall review the application and determine whether to approve the application based upon:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether supplemental coverage under this section would likely result in reduced costs;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any other factor relevant to the issue and supplemental coverage for payment of the bonds which are the subject of the application.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board may determine to provide supplemental coverage for revenue bonds under this section and may impose terms, conditions and limits on that supplemental coverage as it finds, in its discretion, are necessary to protect state funds and ensure the viability of the program. In addition, the board may provide supplemental coverage for refunding of revenue bonds issued on or before November 1, 2015, provided the refunding is not combined with any bonds issued after November 1, 2015. A decision by the board not to approve supplemental coverage for revenue bonds under this section is not subject to judicial review under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(d) As a condition of participating in the supplemental coverage program under this section, the university shall enter into agreements necessary to provide that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The state of Wyoming, through the state treasurer, shall assume responsibility for and make all payments to the university's paying agent in the amount necessary to pay principal and interest on the bonds subject to the supplemental coverage;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The university shall deposit funds with the state by a certain date and in a sufficient amount so that the state can make the entire principal and interest payment to the university's paying agent in a timely manner;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the university fails to comply with paragraph (ii) of this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(A) The state shall make the full payment due from federal mineral royalties as provided by W.S. 9-4-601(d)(vii) for this purpose;</p>
                  <p>(B) To the extent that the university has not deposited sufficient funds with the state to comply with paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the state is deemed to have loaned and the university is deemed to have borrowed those funds subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
                  <p>(I) The loan shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average interest earned on pooled investments of state funds in the four (4) calendar quarters preceding the quarter in which the loan occurred;</p>
                  <p>(II) The loan, including principal and interest, shall be repaid from revenues from the university's general fund that are neither state appropriations to the university nor pledged revenues under W.S. 21-17-404(a)(xiv)(A). The loan is not deemed to be a general obligation of the university, and the state shall not require repayment from any source other than as provided in this subdivision;</p>
                  <p>(III) The university may make additional payments on the loan.</p>
                  <p>(C) The state loan and investment board may require the university to modify its fiscal practices and its general operations if the board determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the university will not be able to make future payments required under paragraph (ii) of this subsection.</p>

                  <p>(iii) Requirements for planned maintenance schedules designed to eliminate maintenance backlogs and to establish proactive maintenance practices;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Uniform standards for assessing and approving agency building and other space needs.</p>
                  <p>(e) Rules and procedures adopted under this section by the state building commission shall be applicable to all state owned buildings unless the operation, management and use of the building has been assigned by statute to a specific state agency. The agency responsible for the operation and management of a state building exempted by the provisions of this subsection, shall provide the assessment required by subsections</p>
                  <p>(a) through (c) of this section to the state building commission for inclusion in the commission's report to the legislature.</p>
                  <p>The rules adopted by the commission under subsection (d) of this section shall be used as guidelines for the management of state buildings assigned by statute to other state agencies including the University of Wyoming, community college districts, department of transportation, game and fish commission and state institutions.</p>
                  <p>(f) The state building commission shall meet at least quarterly and shall promulgate rules specifying procedures under which public comment may be received regarding any actions of the commission, excluding promulgation of rules to which the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act is applicable.</p>

                  <p>(i) Be based on the gross square footage of buildings and facilities for not more than seven (7) categories of buildings and shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) Include only buildings providing education programs comprising the statewide college system strategic plan developed and maintained under W.S. 21-18-202(a)(v);</p>
                  <p>(B) Specifically exclude student housing, student unions and auxiliary services areas funded exclusively through community college generated revenues.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Use a multiplier to maintain facilities in at least fair condition based on criteria from organizations with expertise in the area of major maintenance funding;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Otherwise be computed in the same manner as for major maintenance for school facilities under W.S. 21-15-109, including using the most current edition of the R.S. Means construction cost index, as modified to reflect current Wyoming construction costs determined by the department of administration and information, division of economic analysis, to calculate replacement cost.</p>
                  <p>(h) As used in this section "major building and facility repair and replacement" means the repair or replacement of complete or major portions of building and facility systems at irregular intervals which is:</p>
                  <p>(i) Required to continue the use of the building or facility at its original capacity for its original intended use, including for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and including installing fire suppression systems in residential facilities; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Typically accomplished by contractors due to the personnel demand to accomplish the work in a timely manner, the level of sophistication of the work or the need for warranted work.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever any property escheats or is forfeited to the state for its use, the legal title vests in the state from the time of the escheat or forfeiture. A complaint may be filed by the county attorney of the proper county or by the attorney general in the name of the state of Wyoming against the person or bank which possesses the escheated or forfeited property, in the district court of the proper county for the recovery of the property, alleging the grounds on which the recovery is claimed, and like proceedings in judgment shall be had as in a civil action for the recovery of property. In any such action due proof that any real or personal property has been unclaimed for five (5) years immediately prior to the time of filing the complaint and that the name or whereabouts of the owner of the property is unknown is prima facie evidence of the failure of title to the property for want of legal heirs.</p>
                  <p>(b) In cases where probate proceedings are commenced upon the estate of any person without known heirs no action under subsection (a) of this section need be brought. The court having jurisdiction of the estate shall enter a decree in the estate, distributing the unclaimed property remaining for distribution in the estate to the state of Wyoming. Where probate proceedings have been commenced but have never been completed, the county attorney or attorney general may proceed as provided by subsection (a) of this section. In any such estate, the failure of any heirs or devisees of the deceased to appear and establish a claim within the time fixed by the notice of final settlement of the estate for filing objections to the final account and petition for distribution is prima facie evidence of the failure of title to the property of the estate for want of legal heirs or devisees.</p>
                  <p>(c) In all cases in which any property, or any refunds, dividends or other payments are ordered to be conveyed or paid to persons in the state of Wyoming by a decree, judgment or order of any court or governmental agency, and the property, refunds, dividends or other payments are not claimed by the person entitled thereto within the time fixed or limited by the order of the court or governmental agency directing the payment thereof, the property, refunds, dividends or other payments are the property of the state of Wyoming, subject to subsection (d) of this section. At the expiration of the fixed or limited time, the court or governmental agency shall enter the proper decree, judgment or order directing that the property escheat to the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(d) All funds obtained by the state by escheat or forfeiture, shall be paid over to the state treasurer and kept by him in a separate account for a period of five (5) years during which time the monies are payable by him to the true owners upon presentment of a proper claim supported by satisfactory proof of ownership. After expiration of the five (5) year period without lawful claim, the funds shall be credited to the common school permanent land fund account. All real and personal property obtained by the state of Wyoming by escheat or forfeiture shall be received by and shall be under the direction and control of the state treasurer who shall give a receipt to the court therefor. The property shall be held in kind, except as hereinafter provided, by the state treasurer for a period of five (5) years during which time it is subject to claims by the rightful owners who may file their claims in the court which had original jurisdiction of the property. After the expiration of the five (5) year period without lawful claim therefor, the state treasurer shall sell the personal property at public or private sale, and shall sell the real property in the manner provided in W.S. 36-9-101 through 36-9-120 for the sale of state lands. The proceeds received from the sale shall be paid into the state treasury of the state and shall be credited by the state treasurer to the common school permanent land fund account.</p>
                  <p>(e) All real property held by the state treasurer during the five (5) year redemption period provided by subsection (d) of this section, may be transferred by the state treasurer to the state board of land commissioners to be administered as other state lands and shall not be sold except as hereafter provided. When any real or personal property will, in the opinion of the state treasurer, depreciate in value, the state treasurer may petition the court which had original jurisdiction over the property, for an order directing the sale of the property. Upon receipt of the order the state treasurer shall dispose of the property as ordered by the court. Any monies obtained by the conversion shall be credited to a separate account for the remaining five (5) years, during which time the monies shall be payable by the state treasurer to the true owners in the manner, and upon proof, as provided in subsection</p>
                  <p>(d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) This section does not apply to property which is subject to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, W.S. 34-24-101 through 34-24-140.</p>

                  <p>Article VII. Supplementary Agreements</p>
                  <p>(a) To the extent that the board has not undertaken an activity or project which would be within its power under the provisions of article V of this compact, any two (2) or more of the party states (acting by their duly constituted administrative officials) may enter into supplementary agreements for the undertaking and continuance of such an activity or project. Any such agreement shall specify the purpose or purposes; its duration and the procedure for termination thereof or withdrawal therefrom; the method of financing and allocating the costs of the activity or project; and such other matters as may be necessary or appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(b) No such supplementary agreement entered into pursuant to this article shall become effective prior to its submission to and approval by the board. The board shall give such approval unless it finds that the supplementary agreement or activity or project contemplated thereby is inconsistent with the provisions of this compact or a program or activity conducted by or participated in by the board.</p>
                  <p>(c) Unless all of the party states participate in a supplementary agreement, any cost or costs thereof shall be borne separately by the states party thereto. However, the board may administer or otherwise assist in the operation of any supplementary agreement.</p>
                  <p>(d) No party to a supplementary agreement entered into pursuant to this article shall be relieved thereby of any obligation or duty assumed by said party state under or pursuant to this compact, except that timely and proper performance of such obligation or duty by means of the supplementary agreement may be offered as performance pursuant to the compact.</p>
                  <p>(e) The provisions of this article shall apply to supplementary agreements and activities thereunder, but shall not be construed to repeal or impair any authority which officers or agencies of party states may have pursuant to other laws to undertake cooperative arrangements or projects.</p>
                  <p>Article VIII. Other Laws and Relations</p>
                  <p>(a) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to have the following effect:</p>
                  <p>(i) Permit or require any person or other entity to avoid or refuse compliance with any law, rule, regulation, order or ordinance of a party state or subdivision thereof now or hereafter made, enacted or in force;</p>

                  <p>(c) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>(d) Guam and American Samoa, or either of them may participate in the compact to such extent as may be mutually agreed by the board and the duly constituted authorities of Guam or American Samoa, as the case may be. However, such participation shall not include the furnishing or receipt of mutual aid pursuant to article VI, unless that article has been enacted or otherwise adopted so as to have the full force and effect of law in the jurisdiction affected. Neither Guam nor American Samoa shall be entitled to voting participation on the board, unless it has become a full party to the compact.</p>
                  <p>Article X. Severability and Construction The provisions of this compact and of any supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact or such supplementary agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact or such supplementary agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact or any supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact or such supplementary agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. The provisions of this compact and of any supplementary agreement entered into pursuant thereto shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof.</p>

                  <p>The Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management is hereby enacted into law and entered into by the State of Wyoming as a party, and is in full force and effect between the state and any other states joining therein in accordance with the terms of the compact, which compact is substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I-POLICY AND PURPOSE</p>
                  <p>The party states recognize that low-level radioactive wastes are generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the states. It is further recognized that the protection of the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states in minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of such wastes and through the cooperation of the states in providing facilities that serve the region. It is the policy of the party states to undertake the necessary cooperation to protect the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and to provide for the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort among the party states so that the protection of the citizens of the states and the maintenance of the viability of the states' economies will be enhanced while sharing the responsibilities of radioactive low-level waste management.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE II-DEFINITIONS</p>
                  <p>As used in this compact:</p>
                  <p>(1) "Facility" means any site, location, structure, or property used or to be used for the storage, treatment, or disposal of low-level waste, excluding federal waste facilities;</p>
                  <p>(2) "Low-level waste" means waste material which contains radioactive nuclides emitting primarily beta or gamma radiation, or both, in concentrations or quantities which exceed applicable federal or state standards for unrestricted release. Low-level waste does not include waste containing more than ten (10) nanocuries of transuranic contaminants per gram of material, nor spent reactor fuel, nor material classified as either high-level waste or waste which is unsuited for disposal by near-surface burial under any applicable federal regulations;</p>
                  <p>(3) "Generator" means any person, partnership, association, corporation, or any other entity whatsoever which, as a part of its activities, produces low-level radioactive waste;</p>
                  <p>(4) "Host state" means a state in which a facility is located.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE III-REGULATORY PRACTICES</p>
                  <p>Each party state hereby agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state. Such practices shall include:</p>
                  <p>(1) Maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state;</p>
                  <p>(2) Periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities thereon;</p>
                  <p>(3) Authorization of the containers in which such waste may be shipped, and a requirement that generators use only that type of container authorized by the state;</p>
                  <p>(4) Assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities, and appropriate enforcement action taken for violations;</p>
                  <p>(5) After receiving notification from a host state that a generator within the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation standards, the party state will take appropriate action to assure that such violations do not recur. Such action may include inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by that generator.</p>
                  <p>Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit any party state's authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this article.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE IV-REGIONAL FACILITIES</p>
                  <p>(1) Facilities located in any party state, other than facilities established or maintained by individual low-level waste generators for the management of their own low-level waste, shall accept low-level waste generated in any party state if such waste has been packaged and transported according to applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                  <p>(2) No facility located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of the region comprised of the party states, except as provided in article V.</p>
                  <p>(3) Until such time as paragraph (2) of article IV takes effect, facilities located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of any of the party states only if such waste is accompanied by a certificate of compliance issued by an official of the state in which such waste shipment originated. Such certificate shall be in such form as may be required by the host state, and shall contain at least the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The generator's name and address;</p>
                  <p>(B) A description of the contents of the low-level waste container;</p>
                  <p>(C) A statement that the low-level waste being shipped has been inspected by the official who issued the certificate or by his agent or by a representative of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and found to have been packaged in compliance with applicable federal regulations and such additional requirements as may be imposed by the host state;</p>
                  <p>(D) A binding agreement by the state of origin to reimburse any party state for any liability or expense incurred as a result of an accidental release of such waste during shipment or after such waste reaches the facility.</p>
                  <p>(4) Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of any one (1) party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis. Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in their region will be reached through a good faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received.</p>
                  <p>(5) The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management. Therefore, in consideration of the state of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as such action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states.</p>
                  <p>(6) Any host state may establish a schedule of fees and requirements related to its facility, to assure that closure, perpetual care, and maintenance and contingency requirements are met, including adequate bonding.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V-NORTHWEST LOW-LEVEL WASTE COMPACT COMMITTEE The governor of each party state shall designate one (1) official of that state as the person responsible for administration of this compact. The officials so designated shall together comprise the northwest low-level waste compact committee. The committee shall meet as required to consider matters arising under this compact. The parties shall inform the committee of existing regulations concerning low-level waste management in their states, and shall afford all parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any proposed modifications in such regulations. Notwithstanding any provision of article IV to the contrary, the committee may enter into arrangements with states, provinces, individual generators, or regional compact entities outside the region comprised of the party states for access to facilities on such terms and conditions as the committee may deem appropriate. However, it shall require a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all such members, including the affirmative vote of the member of any party state in which a facility affected by such arrangement is located, for the committee to enter into such arrangement.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VI-ELIGIBLE PARTIES AND EFFECTIVE DATE</p>
                  <p>(1) Each of the following states is eligible to become a party to this compact: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. As to any eligible party, this compact shall become effective upon enactment into law by that party, but it shall not become initially effective until enacted into law by two (2) states. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing its approval.</p>
                  <p>(2) After the compact has initially taken effect pursuant to paragraph (1) of this article, any eligible party state may become a party to this compact by the execution of an executive order by the governor of the state. Any state which becomes a party in this manner shall cease to be a party upon the final adjournment of the next general or regular session of its legislature or July 1, 1983, whichever occurs first, unless the compact has by then been enacted as a statute by that state.</p>
                  <p>(3) Paragraph (2) of article IV of this compact shall take effect on July 1, 1983, if consent is given by Congress. As provided by Public Law 96-573, Congress may withdraw its consent to the compact after every five (5) year period.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VII-SEVERABILITY</p>
                  <p>If any provision of this compact, or its application to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, all other provisions of this compact, and the application of all of its provisions to all other persons and circumstances, shall remain valid; and to this end the provisions of this compact are severable.</p>

                  <p>(a) This act creates the Wyoming community development authority. The authority is a body corporate operating as a state instrumentality operated solely for the public benefit. Its membership consists of ten (10) directors, seven (7) of whom are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. Not more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the appointed directors shall be from the same political party. Directors shall serve for staggered terms of four (4) years each. No appointed director shall serve more than two (2) successive four (4) year terms. A director's term may be terminated by the governor under the same procedure and in the same manner as provided by W.S. 9-1-202(a) or a majority vote of the senate. Directors shall continue in office until their successors are appointed and qualified. If a vacancy occurs, the governor shall appoint a successor to serve in accordance with W.S. 28-12-101. The board of directors shall select one (1) of its members to act as chairman of the board of directors and one (1) member to act as treasurer. The board of directors appoints the executive director of the authority, who serves as the executive secretary to the board and is the chief executive officer of the authority. The executive director serves at the pleasure of the board. The executive director shall be an ex officio member of the board but may not vote. The governor and the state treasurer are members of the board and may vote.</p>
                  <p>(b) The directors, other than the executive director, the governor and the state treasurer, shall receive compensation for each day or part thereof in which they are engaged in performance of their official duties at the same rate as state legislators and shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties. The board shall fix the salary of the executive director. Subject to the approval of the directors, and pursuant to W.S. 9-7-118 the executive director shall determine the terms of employment, tenure, duties, working conditions, promotion and termination of all other employees which the executive director determines are necessary to carry out the purposes and functions of the authority. Employees of the authority may be covered by and subject to the provisions of the Wyoming Retirement Act, the State Employees and Officials Group Insurance Act and the Wyoming Deferred Compensation Act.</p>
                  <p>(c) The authority shall exist perpetually or until terminated by law. No termination of the authority shall take effect so long as the authority has bonds and other obligations outstanding, unless adequate provision has been made for the payment thereof. Upon termination of the authority, all its rights and properties shall pass to and be vested in the state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board shall determine the date, time, place and method of notice for all regular meetings of the board. A majority of the voting directors of the authority constitutes a quorum for the transaction of any business or the exercise of any power or function of the authority. All matters shall be decided by a majority vote of the voting members of the board. Minutes of board meetings shall be kept, maintained and open to members of the public. Notice of meetings shall be given to the public prior to the meetings and meetings shall be open to the public in accordance with W.S. 16-4-401 through 16-4-408. In emergency circumstances, as unanimously determined by the board members, the board may take action by conference telephone or similar communications equipment whereby all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. The conversation shall be recorded, immediately transcribed as minutes of the board, and notice given of their availability for public review. The finding by the board that an emergency exists shall be binding and conclusive unless clearly erroneous.</p>
                  <p>(e) The authority shall execute and maintain at its expense a blanket surety bond covering each director, the executive director and the employees or other officers of the authority in the penal sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(f) Neither the directors, the executive director, the employees of the authority nor any other person executing bonds shall be subject to any personal liability by reason of their issuance.</p>
                  <p>(g) Notwithstanding any other provision, the directors, the executive director and the employees of the authority shall receive approval in advance from the governor prior to traveling out of state on official business. Except as specifically provided in this act, the provisions of W.S. 9-2-1001 through 9- 2-1024 do not apply to the authority.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to the other powers granted in this act, the authority:</p>
                  <p>(i) May purchase from mortgage lenders or make commitments to purchase, or take assignments from mortgage lenders of notes and mortgages evidencing loans for the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of residential real property in the state. If the notes and mortgages are financed with bond proceeds, the notes and mortgages shall be insured or guaranteed in whole or in part by governmental or private mortgage insurers, including the fund created by W.S. 9-7-123, or otherwise secured as provided in the resolution or trust indenture authorizing bonds of the authority;</p>
                  <p>(ii) May make loans to mortgage lenders which are general obligations of the respective lenders and may establish maturity dates, repayment schedules, provisions for prepayment, the nature, bond, note or other certificate of indebtedness and other provisions consistent with this section which the authority determines are necessary. The authority shall require as a condition of each loan to a mortgage lender that the mortgage lender, on or before a designated date shall have entered into written commitments to make, and shall proceed as promptly as practicable to make and disburse, new mortgages on residential real property in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of the loan;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Shall require that loans to mortgage lenders are additionally secured as to payment of both principal and interest by a pledge of and lien upon collateral security in the amounts the authority by resolution determines to be necessary to assure the payment of the loans and the interest thereon as they become due. Such collateral security shall be determined by the authority and may consist of those obligations described in W.S. 9-7-105(a)(xiv) or mortgages secured by first mortgage liens on residential real property in the state;</p>
                  <p>(iv) May, in connection with any mortgage loan or loan to a mortgage lender, foreclose on any property on which the authority holds a mortgage loan, or realize upon any collateral pledged as security, or commence any action to protect or enforce any right conferred upon it by any law, mortgage, contract or other agreement, and bid for and purchase such property or collateral at any foreclosure or at any other sale, or acquire or take possession of any such property or collateral. In the event of a proposed or existing foreclosure or sale of collateral the authority may complete, administer, pay the principal of and interest on any obligations in connection with the property, subordinate its interest to other financing, dispose of, and otherwise deal with the property in the manner that may be necessary or desirable to protect the interest of the authority therein;</p>
                  <p>(v) Shall adopt, modify or repeal rules and regulations governing the making of loans to mortgage lenders, the purchase and sale of mortgage loans and the application of the proceeds thereof, including but not limited to rules and regulations relating to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Housing, income or other reasonable eligibility standards for persons or families to be financed from mortgage loans purchased from mortgage lenders or from loans to mortgage lenders;</p>
                  <p>(B) Limitations or restrictions as to the location or other qualifications or characteristics of residences to be financed from the proceeds of the purchases or loans;</p>
                  <p>(C) Restrictions as to the interest rates on loans made from the proceeds of the purchase of mortgage loans or from loans to mortgage lenders or the return realized therefrom by mortgage lenders;</p>
                  <p>(D) Requirements as to any commitments by mortgage lenders with respect to the application of the proceeds of the purchase or loan; and</p>
                  <p>(E) Schedules of any fees and charges necessary to provide for expenses and reserves of the authority.</p>
                  <p>(vi) May adopt a program or issue bonds to purchase mortgage loans or make loans to mortgage lenders if the authority finds:</p>
                  <p>(A) That the mortgage lending resources of the mortgage lenders are not sufficient to adequately finance the housing needs of the state; and</p>
                  <p>(B) That the loan to lenders or mortgage loan purchased will promote better housing in the state.</p>
                  <p>(vii) May make, purchase from lenders, make commitments to purchase or take assignments from mortgage lenders of notes for home improvement loans, or make loans or commitments to lenders for the purpose of making funds available for home improvement loans. The home improvement loans to lenders shall be secured in a manner the authority determines;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Shall receive all funds which may be appropriated to it from the state treasury for the purpose of reducing the interest rate on mortgage loans made to low and moderate income persons. The authority shall allocate the lower interest rate mortgages only to persons and families of low and moderate income in need of assistance in obtaining decent, safe and sanitary housing at affordable rates;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Shall perform other duties consistent with its purpose as authorized by the legislature for the period prescribed by the legislature.</p>

                  <p>(a) The principal and interest on any bonds issued by the authority may be secured by a pledge of any revenues and receipts of the authority or assignment of mortgage loans or other assets purchased and may be secured by a mortgage or other instrument covering all or any part of a project or economic development project, including any additions, improvements, extensions to or enlargements of any project or economic development project later made, or assignment, pledge or any loan or loan participation.</p>

                  <p>(d) Each pledge, agreement, mortgage or other instrument made for the benefit or security of any bonds of the authority is valid and binding from the time when made. The revenues, receipts, monies and assets pledged are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without delivery or further act. The lien is valid and binding against persons having claims of any kind against the authority whether or not the persons have actual notice of the lien. Neither the resolution nor the indenture or other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed.</p>
                  <p>(e) The authority may provide in the proceedings under which bonds are authorized that any part or all of any project or economic development project may be purchased, constructed, reconstructed or improved by the authority, any municipality or any lessee or designee of the authority, and may also provide for the time and manner of and requisites for disbursements to be made for the cost of construction and for all the certificates and approvals of construction and disbursements as the authority considers necessary.</p>

The interest earned on the amount deposited in any reserve fund may be used for the purpose of defraying the cost of the authority's operations. Money in any debt service reserve fund shall not be withdrawn if it would reduce the amount of the fund to less than the amount which is pledged in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds secured by the debt service reserve fund, except for the purpose of paying principal and interest on bonds maturing and becoming due, and for the payment of which other monies of the authority are not available.</p>

                  <p>(i) Be for a project or an economic development project meeting policies and objectives of this act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be through an applicant approved by the authority;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Contain amortization provisions satisfactory to the authority; and</p>

                  <p>(d) Any contract for insurance made under this section shall provide that claims are payable from the insurance fund or a separate account in the insurance fund. The obligation of the authority to make payments under any insurance contract is limited solely to the insurance fund and is not a debt or liability of the state. Any insurance contract and any rule, regulation or guideline of the authority implementing the insurance program may contain other terms, provisions or conditions the authority considers necessary. Any premium for insuring a loan payment under this section may be determined on a basis, payable by a person in an amount and at a time determined by the authority. The premium amount may differ among any insured loan, lease or other credit agreement.</p>
                  <p>(e) The authority shall establish an insurance fund held by a trustee or other fiduciary designated by the authority. All insurance fees and premiums shall be deposited into the fund along with up to two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000.00) prior to April 1, 1985 and an additional one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) thereafter from other revenues and assets of the authority as the authority considers necessary to comply with any contract or agreement entered into under this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) The insurance fund shall be used to satisfy any claim resulting from a defaulted loan, lease or other credit agreement. The fund may also be used for any other purpose prescribed by the authority pursuant to guaranty contracts with financial institutions under this section including the protection of the authority's interest in projects during periods of delinquency or upon default.</p>
                  <p>(g) The minimum reserve requirement for the insurance fund shall be an amount provided by agreement, resolution or indenture with bond holders. No additional loan, lease or other credit agreement may be insured if the amount available in the insurance fund is less than the minimum reserve requirement.</p>

                <p>(a) No state employer may discharge, discipline or retaliate against an employee by unreasonably altering the terms, location or conditions of employment because the employee acting in good faith and within the scope of duties of employment:</p>
                <p>(i) Reports in writing to the employer what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a demonstration of fraud, waste or gross mismanagement in state government office;</p>
                <p>(ii) Reports in writing to the employer what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a violation of a law, regulation, code or rule adopted under the laws of this state or the United States;</p>
                <p>(iii) Reports in writing to the employer what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a condition or practice that would put at risk the health or safety of that employee or any other individual;</p>
                <p>(iv) Participates or is requested to participate in any investigation, hearing or inquiry; or</p>
                <p>(v) Has refused to carry out a directive which is beyond the scope, terms and conditions of his employment that would expose the employee or any individual to a condition likely to result in serious injury or death, after having sought and been unable to obtain a correction of the dangerous condition from the employer.</p>
                <p>(b) Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to an employee who has reported or caused to be reported a violation or unsafe condition or practice, unless the employee has first brought the alleged violation, condition or practice to the attention of a person having supervisory authority over the employee and has allowed the state employer a reasonable opportunity to correct that violation, condition or practice. Prior notice to a person having supervisory authority is not required if the employee reasonably believes that the report may not result in prompt correction of the violation, condition or practice. In such cases, the employee shall report the violation, condition or practice to the department or agency director of the state entity with which he is employed or to the office of the governor. In the event the alleged violation, condition or practice occurred within the office of the governor, the employee may report the violation, condition or practice to the office of the secretary of state.</p>
                <p>(c) Any employee who is discharged, disciplined or otherwise penalized by a state employer in violation of this section may after exhausting all available administrative remedies, bring a civil action within ninety (90) days after the date of the final administrative determination or within ninety (90) days after the violation, whichever is later, in the district court for the judicial district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or where the state employer has its principal office. An employee's recovery from any action under this section shall be limited to reinstatement of his previous job, payment of back wages and re-establishment of employee benefits to which he would have otherwise been entitled if the violation had not occurred. In addition, the court may allow the prevailing party his costs together with reasonable attorney's fees to be taxed by the court. Any employee found to have knowingly made a false report shall be subject to disciplinary action by his employer up to and including dismissal.</p>
                <p>(d) A state employer shall ensure that its employees are aware of their rights under this chapter.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created the Wyoming business council. The council is a body corporate operating as a state instrumentality operated solely for the public benefit. As such it shall have, and is hereby vested with, the powers and duties conferred in this chapter.

As unanimously determined by the council members, the council may take action by conference telephone or similar communications equipment whereby all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time.</p>
                  <p>(e) The council may execute and maintain at its expense a blanket surety bond covering each director, the chief executive officer and the employees or other officers of the council in the penal sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>9-12-202. Applications for financial aid from the council.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) All applications for financial aid shall be submitted to the council who shall investigate and prepare a report concerning the advisability of approving the proposed financial aid for the applicant and concerning any other factors deemed relevant by the council.</p>
                  <p>(b) The investigation and report shall include such facts about the applicant under consideration as its history, wage standards, job opportunities, stability of employment, past and present financial condition and structure, pro-forma income statements, present and future markets and prospects, integrity of management as well as the feasibility of the proposed product to be granted financial aid, including the state of development of the product as well as the likelihood of its commercial feasibility.</p>
                  <p>(c) After consideration of the report, the council shall approve or deny the application. The applicant shall be promptly notified of the decision. In making the decision as to approval or denial of an application, the council shall give priority to those applicants whereby:</p>
                  <p>(i) The proceeds of the seed capital aid will only be used to cover the initial capitalization needs of the enterprise within Wyoming except as otherwise authorized in this article;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The enterprise has a reasonable chance of success;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Participation by the council is necessary to the success of the enterprise because funding for the enterprise is unavailable in the traditional capital markets, or because funding has been offered on terms that would substantially hinder the success of the enterprise;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The enterprise seed capital has the reasonable potential to create a substantial amount of primary employment within the state;</p>
                  <p>(v) The entrepreneur and other founders of the enterprise have already made or are contractually committed to make a substantial financial and time commitment to the enterprise;</p>
                  <p>(vi) There is a reasonable possibility that the council will recoup at least its initial investment from seed capital contracts; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Binding commitments have been made to the council by the applicant for adequate reporting of financial data to the council including a requirement for an annual or other periodic audit of the books of the enterprise, and for control by the council over the management of the enterprise, so as to protect the investment including the right of access to financial and other records of the enterprise.</p>
                  <p>(d) In determining the level of financial support to be advanced, the council shall limit its proportion of financial aid consistent with the existence of a market failure in product development financing but shall not provide more than twenty percent (20%) of the funds of the council for any one (1) project. Any financial aid toward product development financing granted pursuant to this section shall be equally matched or exceeded by the applicant. No financial aid granted pursuant to this section shall in any manner be pledged as collateral by the applicant.</p>
                  <p>(e) Before granting any seed capital financial aid, the council shall enter into an agreement with the applicant providing for a return to the council which is commensurate with the level of risk and amount of the financial aid.</p>

The security interest shall be shared pro rata with the state in percentage of the loan or loan guarantee. If necessary, the council may allow the lead lender to accept substitute security that will protect repayment to the state on a basis substantially equivalent to a first security interest on the project. The council shall ensure that any alternate security is sufficient to prudently protect the state's pro rata interest;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The council shall charge a loan origination fee or loan guarantee fee of one percent (1%) of the total loan or guaranteed loan amount.

                  <p><shortTitle>9-12-1306. Aggregate limitations on investment tax credits; allocation.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The aggregate amount of investment tax credits to be allocated to all participating investors of Wyoming small business investment companies under this article shall not exceed thirty million dollars ($30,000,000.00). No Wyoming small business investment company, on an aggregate basis with its affiliates, shall file credit allocation claims that exceed thirty million dollars ($30,000,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) Tax credits shall be allocated to participating investors in the order that the credit allocation claims are filed with the council, provided that all credit allocation claims filed with the council on the same day shall be treated as having been filed contemporaneously. Any credit allocation claims filed with the council prior to the initial credit allocation claim filing date shall be deemed to have been filed on such initial credit allocation claim filing date. The council shall set the initial credit allocation claim filing date to be not less than ninety (90) days and not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the council begins accepting applications for certification as a Wyoming small business investment company under W.S. 9-12-1303(e).</p>
                  <p>(c) If two (2) or more Wyoming small business investment companies which are qualified under the provisions of this act file credit allocation claims with the council on behalf of their respective participating investors on the same day and the aggregate amount of credit allocation claims exceeds the lesser of the aggregate limit of investment tax credits under this section or the amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day, the credits shall be allocated among the participating investors who filed on that day on a pro rata basis with respect to the amounts claimed. The pro rata allocation for any one (1) participating investor is the product obtained by multiplying a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the credit allocation claim filed on behalf of a participating investor and the denominator of which is the total of all credit allocation claims filed on behalf of all participating investors on that day, by the lesser of the aggregate limit of credits under this section or the amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day.</p>
                  <p>(d) Not more than ten (10) business days after the council receives a credit allocation claim filed by a Wyoming small business investment company on behalf of one (1) or more of its participating investors, the council shall notify the Wyoming small business investment company of the amount of credits allocated to each of the participating investors of that Wyoming small business investment company. In the event a Wyoming small business investment company does not receive an investment of designated capital from each participating investor required to earn the amount of credits allocated to such participating investor within ten (10) business days of the Wyoming small business investment company’s receipt of a notice of allocation, it shall notify the council on or before the next business day and the credits allocated to such participating investor of the Wyoming small business investment company shall be forfeited.</p>
                  <p>The council shall reallocate credits forfeited under this subsection among the participating investors of the other Wyoming small business investment companies on a pro rata basis with respect to the credit allocation claims filed on behalf of the participating investors.</p>
                  <p>(e) The council may impose a civil penalty of not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) upon a participating investor which does not invest the full amount of designated capital required to fund the credits allocated to it by the council in accordance with the credit allocation claim filed on its behalf. The council shall provide by rule, notice and opportunity for hearing prior to imposing a civil penalty under this subsection. In determining the amount of the penalty the council shall consider the direct and indirect cost to the state as a result of the investor's failure to invest the full amount of designated capital.</p>
                  <p>(f) No participating investor, individually or on an aggregate basis with its affiliates, shall file an allocation claim for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the maximum amount of investment tax credits authorized under this article regardless of whether such claim is made in connection with one (1) or more Wyoming small business investment companies.</p>
                  <p>(g) The council shall annually certify by January 31, the amount of investment tax credits for which each participating investor qualifies under this article as of December 31 of the previous year. The certification shall be made to the insurance commissioner, and to the entity otherwise authorized to collect the tax due if the credit is allowed against another tax liability to the state.</p>

The council shall notify a Wyoming small business investment company within ten (10) business days from the receipt of a request of its determination and an explanation thereof.

                  <p>(e) If, within six (6) years after its allocation date, a Wyoming small business investment company has not invested at least seventy percent (70%) of its designated capital in qualified investments, neither the Wyoming small business investment company nor its affiliates shall be permitted to receive management fees.</p>
                  <p>(f) If, within eight (8) years after its allocation date, a Wyoming small business investment company has not invested one hundred percent (100%) of its designated capital in qualified investments, neither the Wyoming small business investment company nor its affiliates shall be permitted to receive management fees.</p>
                  <p>(g) A Wyoming small business investment company shall not invest more than twenty percent (20%) of its designated capital in any one (1) qualified business without the specific approval of the council.</p>
                  <p>(h) For purposes of calculating the investment percentages in this section, the cumulative amount of all qualified investments made by a Wyoming small business investment company from the allocation date shall be considered.</p>
                  <p>(j) A Wyoming small business investment company may, at any time but not more than once every two (2) years, request that the council determine if the Wyoming small business investment company is in compliance with the requirements of this section. Upon a request under this subsection, the council shall, not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of a request under this subsection, certify that the Wyoming small business investment company has satisfied the requirements of this section as of the date of the request or provide notice of noncompliance and an explanation of the deficiencies.

                  <p>(a) A public official, public member or public employee shall not make an official decision or vote on an official decision if the public official, public member or public employee has a personal or private interest in the matter.

                <p>(a) The legislature finds:</p>
                <p>(i) Rules enacted and other actions taken by a federal agency in excess of authority authorized by the United States congress acting within its powers under the United States constitution violate the constitution;</p>
                <p>(ii) The federal environmental protection agency has increasingly expanded its rulemaking authority granted by the United States congress;</p>
                <p>(iii) Current rulemaking and other actions of the federal environmental protection agency have severely impacted the ability of the state and its citizens to prudently develop the state's natural resources;</p>
                <p>(iv) The federal occupational safety and health administration has expanded its regulation of highly hazardous chemicals on questionable authority;</p>
                <p>(v) When rulemaking and other actions of the federal environmental protection agency or the federal occupational safety and health administration rest on questionable congressional authority the state is authorized to protect its interests and the interests of its citizens and should challenge those actions, including unlawful rulemaking.</p>
                <p>(b) The legislature declares it is the state's policy to vigorously defend its interests and those of its citizens against rulemaking and other actions of the federal environmental protection agency or the federal occupational safety and health administration which are not authorized by the United States congress or which rest upon questionable authority.</p>
                <p>(c) The attorney general may seek to take action before the federal environmental protection agency, the federal occupational safety and health administration or in any state or federal court to stop the enforcement, administration or implementation of rulemaking or other actions taken by those agencies if, in his judgment, the rulemaking or other action exceeds the authority granted by the United States congress or otherwise rests on questionable authority. Before intervening in or initiating any lawsuit pursuant to this section, the attorney general shall obtain the approval of the governor.</p>

                  <p>(a) A trust account is created to be known as the Wyoming wildlife and natural resource trust account. The trust account shall consist of those funds designated to the account by law and all monies received from federal grants and other contributions, grants, gifts, transfers, bequests and donations to the trust account. The trust account is specifically empowered to accept grants, gifts, transfers, bequests and donations including those which are limited in their purposes by the grantor. Title to any interest in any real property conveyed to the trust account shall be held in the name of the state of Wyoming and shall be administered by the board of land commissioners. Funds deposited within the trust account are intended to be inviolate and constitute a perpetual trust account which shall be invested by the state treasurer as authorized under W.S. 9-4-715(a), (d) and (e) and in a manner to obtain the highest return possible consistent with preservation of the account corpus.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state treasurer shall credit annually to a Wyoming wildlife and natural resource trust income account the interest earned from investment of the trust account corpus. The legislature may, from time to time, appropriate funds directly to the income account for distribution in accordance with the terms of this act. Such specially appropriated funds shall be credited directly by the state treasurer to the income account and are available to the board for award of grants as otherwise permitted by this act.</p>
                  <p>(c) Individuals and other entities may also grant, give, transfer, bequest or donate funds to the trust account or the income account. Such funds shall be credited by the board, with receipt and acknowledgement submitted to the state treasurer, to either the trust account or the income account, as appropriate, in a manner consistent with the conditions attached to their receipt.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board may expend funds from the income account for staffing and other administrative expenses authorized under this act. Additional disbursements from the income account shall be for the following purposes:</p>
                  <p>(i) Improvement and maintenance of existing terrestrial habitat necessary to maintain optimum wildlife populations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Preservation of open spaces by purchase or acquisition of development rights;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Improvement and maintenance of existing aquatic habitat necessary to maintain optimum fish populations;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Acquisition of terrestrial or aquatic habitat when existing habitat is determined critical, or is present in minimal amounts, and acquisition presents the necessary factor in attaining or preserving desired wildlife or fish population levels;</p>
                  <p>(v) Conservation, maintenance, protection and development of wildlife resources, the environment and Wyoming's natural resource heritage;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Participation in water enhancement projects to benefit aquatic habitat for fish populations and allow for other watershed enhancements that benefit wildlife;</p>

                  <p>(viii) To mitigate conflicts and reduce potential for disease transmission between wildlife and domestic livestock.</p>
                  <p>(e) No funds shall be made available under this act for the reintroduction of any native or nonnative game or nongame species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq., as amended.</p>
                  <p>(f) The board shall not have the power of eminent domain.</p>
                  <p>(g) No funds shall be disbursed under this act for fee simple title acquisition of real property, nor shall funds be disbursed under this act to purchase water rights to be held by the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(h) The board shall not accept any fee simple interest in real property but shall make recommendations to the board of land commissioners regarding acceptance of any such interest. The board of land commissioners shall only accept a fee simple interest in real property under this act, and the Wyoming wildlife and natural resource trust account board shall only accept any other interest in property if the property is willingly conveyed by the holder of the interest. The board of land commissioners may in its sole discretion reject any offer to convey a fee simple interest in real property to any account under this act. The Wyoming wildlife and natural resource trust account board may in its sole discretion reject any offer to convey any other interest in property to any account under this act. Any appraisal of real property conducted at the direction of the board or the board of land commissioners under this act shall reflect the fair market value of the property.</p>
                  <p>(j) The Wyoming wildlife and natural resource trust account board may recommend that the board of land commissioners dispose of any interest in real property within the trust account when the board determines that disposal of the interest would be in the best interests of the trust account. The net proceeds from any disposition of real property pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited to the trust account.</p>
                  <p>(k) No water right shall be accepted under this act as a gift, transfer, bequest or donation unless the right is attached to real property accepted under the terms of this act. Any change of use of a water right acquired in this manner shall be done in full compliance with all provisions of Wyoming law.</p>
                  <p>(m) The board shall not require public access to private land as a condition to receive any grant funds under this act.</p>
                  <p>(n) Every conservation easement funded in whole or in part with monies made available by this act shall bind the parties thereto to an agreement which provides that the state of Wyoming is a third party beneficiary to the easement solely with the contingent right to enforce the terms of the easement if the grantee fails to enforce any of the terms of the easement. The agreement shall provide that if the easement is transferred for value, sold or extinguished without the consent of the board, the state of Wyoming shall have the right to either take legal action to enforce the terms of the easement or to recover from the proceeds of the transfer for value, sale or extinguishment, the state's pro rata share of the proceeds based on the funds the state provided for the creation of the easement.</p>
                  <p>(o) No funds shall be disbursed under this act for the purchase of easements which mandate specific livestock or crop management practices.</p>
                  <p>(p) No funds shall be disbursed under this act for the purchase of easements which prohibit the use of land for ranching or farming if the ranching or farming could be conducted, using current or future technologies and techniques, without infringing on the underlying purpose of the easement.</p>
                  <p>(q) No funds shall be disbursed under this act for the purchase of easements which prohibit hunting, fishing or trapping.</p>
                  <p>(r) No funds shall be disbursed under this act unless the person receiving the funds certifies that no gratuities, kickbacks, gifts, commissions, contingency fees or other considerations have been or will be made in connection with the appropriation or the associated grant made by the board.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Establish criteria for matching funds or other in-kind contributions from grantees;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Evaluate, rank and prioritize grant proposals with an emphasis on those projects that are partnerships involving private and public entities;</p>

                  <p>(vi) Establish criteria for the acceptance or rejection of gifts, transfers, bequests and donations including interests in real or personal property, which criteria shall not be inconsistent with this act. Based on those criteria, the board shall make recommendations regarding the acceptance of any fee simple interest in real property to the board of land commissioners. Based on those recommendations, the board of land commissioners shall make a final determination on acceptance or rejection of any fee simple interest in real property under this act;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Consider the socioeconomic impacts of the grant proposal on the community affected;</p>

                  <p>(ii) Accept or decline federal grants and other contributions, grants, gifts, transfers, bequests and donations of any money, personal property or interests in real property other than a fee simple interest from any source. The board shall make recommendations regarding the acceptance of any fee simple interest in real property to the board of land commissioners;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Participate with for profit corporations to develop wildlife habitat, but may not divert financial resources to a for profit corporation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Recommend to the joint appropriations committee and the select committee that funds be transferred from the income account to the trust account.</p>
                  <p>(h) The board shall annually report to the governor, the joint appropriations interim committee, the select committee and the joint travel, recreation, wildlife and cultural resources interim committee no later than September 1 with respect to all federal grants, state appropriations and other contributions, grants, gifts, bequests and donations received and credited to the trust account and income account during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include all grants awarded by the board to nonprofit and governmental organizations and progress made toward the condition of any grant made.</p>
                  <p>(j) Until the corpus of the trust account exceeds two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000.00) the governor may also include in his proposed state budget recommendations for additional funding of the corpus of the trust account. The governor may also include in his proposed state budget recommendations for additional funding of the income account.</p>
                  <p>(k) No funds shall initially be expended from the income account for large projects except upon specific legislative authorization. Following the initial legislative authorization to expend funds for a large project, the board may approve additional grants for that large project not to exceed a total of an additional one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) and shall forward a notice of any such additional grant to the select committee within thirty (30) days of each approval.

                <p><shortTitle>9-17-111. Disposition of lottery proceeds.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) As nearly as practical, at least forty-five percent (45%) of the total revenue from the sale of lottery tickets or shares shall be made available as prize money, provided, however, that this subsection shall be deemed not to create any lien, entitlement, cause of action or other private right and any rights of holders of tickets or shares shall be determined by the corporation in setting the terms of its lottery or lotteries.</p>
                <p>(b) On or before the fifteenth day of each quarter, the corporation shall transfer to the treasurer's office, for credit to the lottery account which is hereby created, at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the net proceeds from the preceding quarter. Final reconciliation of the transfer to the state under this subsection shall be determined at the end of each fiscal year based on the audited annual financial statements. Upon their deposit into the account, any monies representing a deposit of net proceeds shall then become the unencumbered property of the state of Wyoming and the corporation shall have no power to agree or undertake otherwise.</p>
                <p>At least once per fiscal year, these monies shall be paid by the treasurer to the treasurers of the counties, cities and towns for payment into their respective general funds. The percentage of the balance that will be distributed to each county and its cities and towns will be determined by computing the percentage that sales of lottery tickets collected by retailers in each county including its cities and towns bear to total sales of lottery tickets collected by retailers in all counties including their cities and towns. This percentage of the monies shall be distributed within each county as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) To each county in the proportion that the population of the county situated outside the corporate limits of its cities and towns bears to the total population of the county including cities and towns;</p>
                <p>(ii) To each city and town within the county in the proportion the population of the city or town bears to the population of the county.</p>
                <p>(c) Repealed by Laws 2017, ch. 158, § 2.</p>
                <p>(d) No general fund monies or any other state funds or monies in any form shall be used to fund any liability or deficiency in the lottery account under this section. No general fund monies or any other state funds or monies in any form shall be used for any program or project started specifically from lottery proceeds unless specifically appropriated by the legislature.</p>

                <p>(a) The corporation shall investigate the financial responsibility, security and integrity of any lottery system vendor who is a finalist in submitting a bid, proposal or offer. At the time of submitting the bid, proposal or offer to the corporation, the corporation may require the following items:</p>
                <p>(i) A disclosure of the vendor's name and address and, as applicable, the names and addresses of the following:</p>
                <p>(A) If the vendor is a corporation, the officers, directors and each stockholder in the corporation, provided, however, that in the case of owners of equity securities of a publicly traded corporation, only the names and addresses of those known to the corporation to own beneficially five percent (5%) or more of the securities need be disclosed;</p>
                <p>(B) If the vendor is a trust, the trustee and all persons entitled to receive income or benefits from the trust;</p>
                <p>(C) If the vendor is an association, the members, officers and directors; and</p>
                <p>(D) If the vendor is a partnership or joint venture, all of the general partners, limited partners or joint venturers.</p>
                <p>(ii) A disclosure of all the states and jurisdictions in which the vendor does business and the nature of the business for each state or jurisdiction;</p>
                <p>(iii) A disclosure of all the states and jurisdictions in which the vendor has contracts to supply gaming goods or services, including, but not limited to, lottery goods and services and the nature of the goods or services involved for each state or jurisdiction;</p>
                <p>(iv) A disclosure of all the states and jurisdictions in which the vendor has applied for, has sought renewal of, has received, has been denied, has pending or has had revoked a lottery or gaming license of any kind or had fines or penalties assessed to his license, contract or operation and the disposition in each state or jurisdiction. If any lottery or gaming license or contract has been revoked or has not been renewed or any lottery or gaming license or application has been either denied or is pending and has remained pending for more than six (6) months, all of the facts and circumstances underlying the failure to receive the license shall be disclosed;</p>
                <p>(v) A disclosure of the details of any finding or plea, conviction or adjudication of guilt in a state or federal court of the vendor for any felony or any other criminal offense other than a traffic violation;</p>
                <p>(vi) A disclosure of the details of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or corporate or individual purchase or takeover of another corporation, including bonded indebtedness, or any pending litigation of the vendor; and</p>
                <p>(vii) Additional disclosures and information as the corporation may determine to be appropriate for the procurement involved. If at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of a vendor's contract is subcontracted, the vendor shall disclose all of the information required by this section for the subcontractor as if the subcontractor were itself a vendor.</p>
                <p>(b) A lottery major procurement contract shall not be entered into with any lottery system vendor who has not complied with the disclosure requirements described in subsection (a) of this section and any contract with such a vendor is voidable at the option of the corporation. Any contract with a vendor who does not comply with the requirements for periodically updating the disclosures during the tenure of contract as may be specified in the contract may be terminated by the corporation. The provisions of this section shall be construed broadly and liberally to achieve the ends of full disclosure of all information necessary to allow for a full and complete evaluation by the corporation of the competence, integrity, background and character of vendors for procurements.</p>
                <p>(c) A major procurement contract shall not be entered into with any vendor who has been found guilty of a felony related to the security or integrity of the lottery in this or any other jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(d) A major procurement contract shall not be entered into with any vendor if the vendor has an ownership interest in an entity that had supplied consultation services under contract to the corporation regarding the request for proposals pertaining to those particular goods or services.</p>
                <p>(e) No lottery system vendor nor any applicant for a major procurement contract may pay, give or make any economic opportunity, gift, loan, gratuity, special discount, favor, hospitality or service, excluding food and beverages having an aggregate value not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00) in any calendar year, to the chief executive officer, any board member or any employee of the corporation or to a member of the immediate family residing in the same household as the person.</p>

                <p>(b) The corporation shall make every effort to provide small retailers a chance to participate in the sales of lottery tickets or shares.</p>
                <p>(c) The corporation shall provide for compensation to lottery retailers in the form of commissions in an amount of not less than six percent (6%) of gross sales and may provide for other forms of compensation for services rendered in the sale or cashing of lottery tickets or shares.</p>

                <p>(a) The corporation may establish a fidelity fund separate from all other funds and shall assess each retailer a one (1) time fee not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) per sales location. The corporation is authorized to invest the funds or place the funds in one (1) or more interest bearing accounts. Monies deposited to the fund may be used to cover losses the corporation experiences due to nonfeasance, misfeasance or malfeasance of a lottery retailer. In addition, the funds may be used to purchase blanket bonds covering the Wyoming lottery corporation against losses from all retailers. At the end of each fiscal year, the corporation shall pay to the general lottery fund any amount in the fidelity fund which exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) and the funds shall be commingled with and treated as net proceeds from the lottery.</p>
                <p>(b) A reserve account may be established as a general operating expense to cover amounts deemed uncollectible. The corporation shall establish procedures for minimizing any losses that may be experienced for the foregoing reasons and shall exercise and exhaust all available options in the procedures prior to amounts being written off to this account.</p>
                <p>(c) The corporation may require any retailer to post an appropriate bond, as determined by the corporation, using an insurance company acceptable to the corporation. The amount shall not exceed the applicable district sales average of lottery tickets for two (2) billing periods.</p>

                <p>(a) There is created the Wyoming minerals to value added products program. The program is intended to aid economic development of the state by providing mineral product input guarantees to enable the recruitment and operation of commercial scale minerals to value added products facilities, which have demonstrated proof of performance.</p>
                <p>(b) The Wyoming business council shall establish and administer the program under this act. Any commercial scale minerals to value added products facility shall submit a proposal to the governor. The governor may provide recommendations for the size and parameters of the proposed contract. An application to participate in the program shall then be submitted to and reviewed by the Wyoming business council under the process set forth in W.S. 9-12-601 through 9-12-603. The application shall be submitted on forms prescribed by, and subject to rules promulgated by, the Wyoming business council. In determining whether to recommend a contract for approval, the Wyoming business council shall consider if the applicant has demonstrated a business plan, balance sheet, sufficient cash flow, commitments to sell the finished product and other indices necessary to demonstrate the applicant's ability to perform under the contract as determined by rule and regulation of the Wyoming business council.</p>
                <p>(c) The Wyoming business council shall provide recommendations for terms and conditions contained in a proposed contract. The Wyoming business council's recommendations shall be forwarded to the state loan and investment board for final consideration of the application.</p>
                <p>(d) After an application to participate in the program is approved by the state loan and investment board, the Wyoming business council may complete negotiations to contract to supply not more than twenty percent (20%) of the expected mineral supply to the facility for the duration of the contract. Total contract amounts for any one (1) facility shall be set by rule of the state loan and investment board based on the provisions of this act and the expected return to the state of Wyoming, but in no event shall a contract exceed fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00).</p>
                <p>(e) All complete applications to participate in the minerals to value added products program established under this act which conform to the criteria established by this act and rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, shall be considered. The Wyoming business council shall review the application and may communicate directly with the applicant. A determination by the state loan and investment board to approve or disapprove an application under this act is not appealable.</p>
                <p>(f) If the Wyoming business council receives multiple applications to enter a contract under the program, consideration shall be given to whether the applicant has demonstrated a past record of producing jobs in Wyoming and whether the applicant has and is likely to maintain a nexus to the state of Wyoming.</p>
