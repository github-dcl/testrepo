                  <p><shortTitle>23-1-304. Classification of gray wolves.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The commission shall by rule and regulation set seasons and bag limits within those areas where gray wolves are designated as trophy game animals pursuant to W.S. 23-1-101(a)(xii)(B)(I) and (II). The seasons and bag limits shall be set annually in a manner the commission determines, through rule and regulation, as necessary to reasonably ensure at least ten (10) breeding pairs of gray wolves and a total of at least one hundred (100) individual gray wolves are located in this state outside of Yellowstone National Park and the Wind River Indian Reservation at the end of the current calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed by Laws 2007, Ch. 168, \xA7 5.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of this section "breeding pair" means an adult male and an adult female gray wolf raising at least two (2) pups of the year until December 31. The number of breeding pairs shall be certified by the department prior to January 31 of each year.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department shall institute and maintain an active program of population monitoring statewide subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Population monitoring shall include techniques that accurately determine the population and movement of gray wolves in areas of the state where gray wolves are designated as trophy game animals;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The commission is authorized to enter into memoranda of understanding with the United States fish and wildlife service or other federal agencies to ensure accurate and adequate monitoring of wolf population levels and movements;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In all areas of the state, except where otherwise provided, any person who takes a wolf shall notify the department where the take occurred within ten (10) days;</p>
                  <p>(iv) In areas of the state where gray wolves are designated as trophy game animals, any person who takes a wolf shall notify the department of the take and where the take occurred within a time period set by rule and regulation, which shall not exceed seventy-two (72) hours;</p>
                  <p>(v) In areas of the state where gray wolves are designated as trophy game animals, any person who takes a wolf shall submit the wolf or parts thereof, as defined by rule and regulation, to the department for inspection within a time period established by rule and regulation which will not exceed ten (10) days;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any information regarding the number or nature of wolves legally taken within the state of Wyoming shall only be released in its aggregate form and no information of a private or confidential nature shall be released without the written consent of the person to whom the information may refer. Information identifying any person legally taking a wolf within this state is solely for the use of the department or appropriate law enforcement offices and is not a public record for purposes of W.S. 16-4-201 through 16-4-205.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department shall actively monitor big game animal herd populations statewide to determine whether and to what extent the gray wolf is negatively impacting big game animal herds, and thereby hunting opportunities. To the extent permitted by this title, and notwithstanding other provisions of this title by those means authorized by the commission, the department shall manage the gray wolf population as necessary to ensure the long-term health and viability of any big game animal herd that is being threatened in this state.</p>
                  <p>(f) This section shall apply from and after the date gray wolves are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming as provided by W.S. 23-1-108.</p>
                  <p>(g) The commission is authorized, through rule and regulation, to use management techniques including the use of aerial hunting and hazing by the department and issuance of permits to private landowners to take wolves to protect private property including, but not limited to, livestock and other domesticated animals from wolf depredation.</p>
                  <p>(h) Within forty-eight (48) hours of receiving notification from a landowner or his designee that any gray wolf in those areas of the state where gray wolves are designated as trophy game animals has harassed, injured, maimed or killed livestock or any domesticated animal, the department shall respond and initiate appropriate management actions. The department may use the management techniques authorized under subsection (g) of this section or any other management methods necessary, to minimize the harassing, injuring, maiming or killing of livestock and other domesticated animals in those areas of the state where gray wolves are designated as trophy game animals.</p>
                  <p>(j) At any time that there exists the number of breeding pairs of gray wolves and the number of individual gray wolves specified in subsection (a) of this section, the department is authorized to take any action necessary to reduce the effects of gray wolf predation on wild ungulate herds in areas of the state experiencing unacceptable impacts from gray wolf predation.</p>
                  <p>(k) The commission is authorized to enter into memoranda of understanding with any federal agency or other state's wildlife agency to carry out any provision of this section and Wyoming's wolf management plan, including the use of aerial hunting.</p>
                  <p>(m) The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations authorizing lethal control of wolves harassing, injuring, maiming or killing livestock or other domesticated animals and for wolves occupying geographic areas where chronic wolf predation occurs. The rules and regulations shall provide that nonlethal control actions will be used if lethal control could cause relisting of wolves under the endangered species act or if requested by the livestock or domesticated animal owner or agent.</p>
                  <p>(n) The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations providing for issuance of permits to landowners or livestock owners for removing wolves which are harassing, injuring, maiming or killing livestock or other domesticated animals and for wolves occupying geographic areas where chronic wolf predation occurs. Permits issued or renewed under this subsection shall be valid for not more than forty-five (45) days from issuance or renewal. The permits shall be issued as long as the removals authorized by such permits could not reduce the numbers of gray wolves below ten (10) breeding pairs or a total of one hundred (100) individual gray wolves within the state and outside of Yellowstone National Park and the Wind River Indian Reservation. The rules shall provide for suspending the issuance of permits or cancelling existing permits if further lethal control could cause the numbers of gray wolves to be reduced below ten (10) breeding pairs or a total of one hundred (100) individuals in the state outside of Yellowstone National Park and the Wind River Indian Reservation.</p>
                  <p>(o) The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations establishing a fair compensation program to compensate for wolf predation on livestock as provided in W.S. 23-1-901.</p>

                  <p>(a) The commission with the advice of the director shall appoint agents to sell game, bird and fish licenses. Any vendor engaged in the commercial sale of sporting goods and equipment who holds a valid sales tax license issued by the department of revenue under W.S. 39-15-106 may apply to the commission and shall be appointed as an agent to sell game, bird and fish licenses, permits and stamps. At the end of each year, the commission shall renew the appointment of agents who had combined game, bird and fish license, permit and stamp sales during that year of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Renewal of the appointment of agents selling fish licenses only or agents serving remote locations shall not be subject to the one thousand dollar ($1,000.00) minimum sales requirement. The commission shall provide bonding for agents for the purpose of selling game, bird and fish licenses, permits and stamps. Bonding shall be provided upon receipt of a nonrefundable annual fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). The fees shall be deposited in a bond pool fund except in any month when the bond pool fund contains one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or more the fees shall be deposited in the game and fish fund. The fee shall be paid to the commission before December 1 preceding the year for which the bond shall be in effect. Newly appointed agents shall pay the same fee immediately upon appointment by the commission to receive bonding for the remainder of the calendar year in which the agent was appointed. All claims against an agent's bond shall be paid from the bond pool account.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each license selling agent shall charge a fee as provided in this subsection for each license, permit or stamp he sells or distributes pursuant to this act. The fee shall not be charged if this act specifies that the issuance shall be without fee or fails to establish a fee for the issuance of the license, permit or stamp. Each license, permit or stamp sold or distributed under this act shall display the total amount only of all fees and other charges required under this act or otherwise provided by law. Each selling agent shall retain two dollars ($2.00) for each license and fifty cents ($.50) for each stamp or permit he sells. For failure to comply with this section, selling agents shall not be entitled to retain the amounts specified in this subsection and shall be liable on their bond. No employee of the commission shall receive any commission on licenses, stamps or permits sold, but the department shall charge the additional fee specified in this subsection, or otherwise provided by law, for each license, stamp or permit sold by commission employees. The fee charged under this subsection shall be in addition to the amount otherwise established by this act for the license, permit or stamp and shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Two dollars ($2.00) for each license, except that this additional fee shall not be charged for licenses under W.S. 23-1-705(e) or (k), 23-2-101(j)(xi), (xvi), (xvii), (xx), (xxi), (xxxii), (xxxiii), (xliv) or (xlv), 23-2-201(d)(iii) or (iv) or (f) or 23-2-301(c)(xiii);</p>
                  <p>(ii) Fifty cents ($.50) for each stamp;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Fifty cents ($.50) for each permit, except that this additional fee shall not be charged for permits under W.S. 23-1-302(m).</p>
                  <p>(c) Every selling agent shall file a report with the commission at such times and in such manner as prescribed by commission rule and shall account for all licenses, permits, and stamps received by the selling agent to the commission.</p>
                  <p>(d) Every person authorized by the commission or by law to sell and issue licenses is authorized to administer oaths.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department shall supply sufficient numbers of self-locking tags stamped with the words "Wyoming interstate game tag". The commission by rule may authorize the distribution of interstate game tags by taxidermists, meat processing plants or other businesses as the commission determines. The commission by rule may set the commissions for the sale of interstate game tags not to exceed the commissions paid to license selling agents for the sale of licenses. The commission by rule may also set the reporting requirements for businesses authorized to distribute interstate game tags. Interstate game tags shall be furnished through the chief game warden for distribution to the game wardens, and such game tag distributors as the commission may designate. Game wardens and game tag distributors shall collect and remit to the department the proper fee for each Wyoming interstate game tag.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed by Laws 1987, ch. 156, \xA7 2.</p>
                  <p>(g) License selling agents under this section shall be considered representatives of the game and fish department for the purpose of charging fees for costs of processing payments for sales of licenses, permits or stamps. In addition to fees under subsection (b) of this section a license selling agent may charge and collect from the person tendering payment a fee for the cost of processing the payment in the same manner and amount as established by commission rule for sales directly from the game and fish department.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>23-1-703. Limitation of number of certain licenses; reservation of certain licenses; reservation of certain unused licenses.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The commission may limit the number of resident or nonresident big or trophy game animal licenses to be sold in any calendar year and may designate dates after which one (1) or more classes of licenses will not be sold except as authorized by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as specifically provided under this subsection, subsection (f) of this section or W.S. 23-1-705(a), no person may apply for and receive more than one (1) moose or one (1) ram bighorn sheep license in any consecutive five (5) year period. Effective for the 1995 hunting season and each hunting season thereafter, licenses issued under this subsection shall be based upon the number of points assigned to each applicant for a particular species. Effective January 1, 2000, licenses issued under this subsection shall be issued partially through a preference point drawing and partially through a random drawing of all remaining unsuccessful applicants for that year. The department shall assign points to each license applicant for a specific species by multiplying the number of years the applicant has unsuccessfully applied for a license times one (1). The calculation used to assign points to an applicant for a particular species under this subsection shall include any year the applicant does not apply for a big or trophy game animal hunting license for that species, provided in the case of a resident the applicant pays the fee specified in W.S. 23-2-101(k) and in the case of a nonresident the applicant pays the appropriate fee established by the commission under W.S. 23-2-101(m). License applicants within each hunt area for a species shall be grouped according to the number of assigned points for that species. Not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of available licenses within any hunt area shall be randomly selected through a preference point drawing from among the group of applicants with the largest number of assigned points and shall continue until all applicants within that group have been exhausted or until all available licenses have been issued, whichever first occurs. If any applicant grouping has been exhausted and licenses remain available within that hunt area, selection shall continue from among the group of applicants with the next largest number of assigned points.</p>
                  <p>After the selections through the preference point drawing have been completed within a hunt area, the remaining licenses available from that drawing and the licenses available for the random drawing for that hunt area will be issued through a random selection from among all applicants in the hunt area who were not selected for issuance of a license for the species through the preference point drawing in that hunt area. For purposes of assigning points under this subsection, any unsuccessful license applicant failing to apply for a license, or pay the applicable fee in lieu of applying, during the second calendar year shall be considered to be a first year applicant for any subsequent calendar year in which the applicant submits license application for that particular species.</p>
                  <p>(c) For the 1995 hunting season and each hunting season thereafter, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section or by rule of the commission, no person who is issued a hunting license for a grizzly bear or for a mountain goat shall be eligible to apply for or receive a hunting license for that particular species in any future year.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed By Laws 1997, ch. 24, \xA7 2.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commission shall reserve eighty percent (80%) of the moose and seventy-five percent (75%) of the ram and ewe and lamb bighorn sheep, mountain goat and grizzly bear licenses to be issued in any one (1) year for resident hunters. The commission shall determine the allocation of resident and nonresident mountain lion harvest.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding W.S. 23-1-704, 23-2-101(j) and 23-2- 107(e), any person who is issued and purchases a license listed in paragraph (i) of this subsection, but who does not use the license, may reserve a license for the particular species and sex of animal designated on the unused license for use during the immediately succeeding hunting season by applying to the commission in accordance with commission rules as provided in this subsection. Upon receipt of an application that establishes the conditions listed in paragraphs (i) through (iv) of this subsection, the commission shall cancel the initial license and prior to the subsequent season opening date for the designated species and sex of animal, issue to the applicant at an administrative cost of ten dollars ($10.00), a license for the designated animal valid for that season. A person may apply for and reserve a license under this subsection only if all the following conditions exist:</p>
                  <p>(i) The license is one (1) of the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) A limited quota, full price big game animal license;</p>
                  <p>(B) A trophy game animal license;</p>
                  <p>(C) An any wild bison license;</p>
                  <p>(D) A female or calf wild bison license.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The person is unable to use the license in the year for which it was issued and good cause, as defined in commission rule and regulation, exists for the person's inability to use the license in the year for which it was issued;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The person submits an application to the commission that demonstrates eligibility under this subsection before the closing date of the season for which the initial license was issued;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The person submits the initial license with the application.</p>
                  <p>(g) In addition to the authority granted under subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section, the commission may through rule and regulation develop and implement a preference point program for nonresident antelope, nonresident deer and nonresident elk licenses which are limited in quota and would otherwise be issued through a random drawing. A program established pursuant to this subsection may be implemented for all or selected hunt areas and may be applied to all or portions of licenses for any particular species. The commission may charge nonresident license applicants a nonrefundable fee to accumulate preference points under the program as provided in W.S. 23-2-101(m).</p>
                  <p>(h) Rules and regulations shall be promulgated by the game and fish commission to carry out subsections (a) through (f) of this section and may be promulgated as provided in subsection (g) of this section.</p>

Not more than five (5) big horn sheep, five (5) moose and five (5) wild bison licenses shall be issued under this subsection.

Except as provided under subsection (g) of this section, no complimentary licenses may be issued at the request of the appointed commissioners.

                  <p>(a) Any landowner, lessee or agent whose property is being damaged by any of the big or trophy game animals or game birds of this state shall, not later than fifteen (15) days after the damage is discovered by the owner of the property or the representative of the owner, report the damage to the nearest game warden, damage control warden, supervisor or commission member.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any landowner, lessee or agent claiming damages from the state for injury or destruction of property by big or trophy game animals or game birds of this state shall present a verified claim for the damages to the Wyoming game and fish department not later than sixty (60) days after the damage or last item of damage is discovered. The claim shall specify the damage and amount claimed. As used in this subsection, "verified claim" means a claim which the claimant has signed and sworn to be accurate before a person authorized to administer oaths.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department shall consider the claims based upon a description of the livestock or bees damaged or killed by a trophy game animal, the damaged land, growing cultivated crops, stored crops including honey and hives, seed crops, improvements and extraordinary damage to grass. The commission is authorized to establish by rule, methods, factors and formulas to be used for determining the amount to compensate any landowner, lessee or agent for livestock damaged as a result of, missing as a result of, or killed by trophy game animals. Claims shall be investigated by the department and rejected or allowed within ninety (90) days after submission, and paid in the amount determined to be due. In the event the department fails to act within ninety (90) days, the claim, including interest based on local bank preferred rates, shall be deemed to have been allowed. No award shall be allowed to any landowner who has not permitted hunting on his property during authorized hunting seasons. Any person failing to comply with any provision of this section is barred from making any claim against the department for damages. Any claimant aggrieved by the decision of the department may appeal to the commission within thirty (30) days after receipt of the decision of the department as provided by rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the commission.

The commission shall review the investigative report of the department, and it may approve, modify or reverse the decision of the department.</p>
                  <p>(d) Within ninety (90) days after receiving notice of the decision of the commission, the claimant may in writing to the department call for arbitration. Within fifteen (15) days after the department receives the call for arbitration, the claimant and the department shall each appoint a disinterested arbitrator who is an elector residing in the county where the damage occurred and notify each other of the appointment. Within twenty (20) days after their appointment, the two (2) arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator possessing the same qualifications. If the third arbitrator is not appointed within the time prescribed, the judge of the district court of the county or the court commissioner in the absence of the judge shall appoint the third arbitrator upon the application of either arbitrator.</p>
                  <p>(e) At least twenty (20) days before the hearing, the board of arbitrators shall provide the claimant and department notice of the time and place in the county when and where the parties will be heard and the claim investigated and decided by the board. A written copy of the decision shall be promptly served upon each party. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the decision, either party may apply to the board for modification of the decision under W.S. 1-36-111. Either party may apply to the district court for vacation of a decision under W.S. 1-36-114(a) or correction or modification of a decision under W.S. 1-36-115 within thirty (30) days after receipt of the decision or within twenty (20) days after action by the board on an application for modification under W.S. 1-36-111.</p>
                  <p>(f) If no applications under subsection (e) of this section are made after receipt of the decision, the commission shall promptly pay the amount, if any, including interest based on local bank preferred rates, awarded by the board. Within thirty (30) days after the award is final, the board's reasonable service and expense charges shall be paid by:</p>
                  <p>(i) The claimant if the award is no greater than the amount originally authorized by the commission;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Otherwise, the commission.</p>
                  <p>(g) For purposes of this section, eligibility for damage compensation shall include gray wolves located in:</p>
                  <p>(i) The area described in W.S. 23-1-101(a)(xii)(B)(I) or (II) regardless of the date on which the damage occurs;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subject to subsection (h) of this section, an area of land designated by the commission in rule which is adjacent to the area described in W.S. 23-1-101(a)(xii)(B)(I) or</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>23-2-101. Fees; restrictions; nonresident application fee; nonresident licenses; verification of residency required.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any qualified person may purchase a hunting license from the department or its authorized selling agents except as otherwise provided. Purchase of a license entitles the licensee to take any animal, bird or fish provided on the license within Wyoming at the time, in a place, in a manner and in an amount as provided by law and the orders of the commission. At the time of application for a resident license under this section, the applicant shall provide a valid Wyoming driver's license or a copy thereof, or other proof of residency. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules and regulations stating what proof of residency is required so that only bona fide Wyoming residents, as defined in W.S. 23-1-102(a)(ix), receive resident licenses. For purposes of purchasing a lifetime resident license under subsection (j) of this section, an applicant shall have been a resident as defined in W.S. 23-1-102(a)(ix) continuously for a ten (10) year period immediately preceding the application date.</p>
                  <p>(b) Repealed by Laws 1999, ch. 92, \xA7 2.</p>
                  <p>(c) The resident's or nonresident's license must bear the signature of the landowner, lessee, or agent of the owner on whose private property he is hunting or the legitimate proof as evidence that permission to hunt has been granted.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission may issue big or trophy game licenses in areas in which all licenses initially authorized were not purchased or in which additional harvest is desired, allowing a licensee to take a big or trophy game animal of such sex or age as designated by the commission. The fee for the license may be reduced by the commission to the level necessary to achieve the desired management objectives, but in no case shall a resident or nonresident license fee be less than the landowner's coupon fee.</p>
                  <p>(e) Resident and nonresident license applicants shall pay an application fee in an amount specified by this subsection upon submission of an application for purchase of any limited quota drawing for big or trophy game license or wild bison license. The resident application fee shall be five dollars ($5.00) and the nonresident application fee shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00). The application fee is in addition to the fees prescribed by subsections (f) and (j) of this section and by W.S. 23-2-107 and shall be payable to the department either directly or through an authorized selling agent of the department. At the beginning of each month, the commission shall set aside all of the fees collected during calendar year 1980 and not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the fees collected thereafter pursuant to this subsection to establish and maintain a working balance of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00), to compensate owners or lessees of property damaged by game animals and game birds.</p>
                  <p>(f) Forty percent (40%) of available nonresident elk licenses, forty percent (40%) of available nonresident deer licenses and forty percent (40%) of available nonresident antelope licenses for any one (1) calendar year shall as established by the commission, be offered to nonresident applicants upon receipt of the fee prescribed by this subsection. Seventy-five (75) of the nonresident deer licenses set aside pursuant to this subsection shall be used for a national bow hunt for deer. The licenses authorized by this subsection shall be offered by drawing to nonresident applicants prior to the drawing for the remaining nonresident licenses issued.

Payment of the fee for a particular species under this subsection shall authorize the person to accumulate points under W.S. 23-1-703(b) for that year in the same manner as if he had unsuccessfully applied for a hunting license for that species. Payment of the fee shall be made in compliance with application dates.</p>
                  <p>(m) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, as part of any preference point program for nonresident antelope, nonresident ram bighorn sheep, nonresident moose, nonresident deer or nonresident elk, the commission may establish a nonrefundable fee to be either withheld from the license fee remitted or submitted separately when application for a license or preference point is made through electronic licensing, and may also establish a fee to be paid in lieu of applying for licenses that are limited in quota. Retention of the established fee or payment of the fee in lieu of applying shall authorize the person to accumulate a preference point for future drawings for licenses that are limited in quota for the applicable species in accordance with rules of the commission. The rules may provide for the loss of all accumulated points for persons failing to apply or to pay the in lieu fee in two (2) consecutive calendar years. The fee for any program under this subsection for antelope, deer or elk shall be established by rule and shall not exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per species. Payment of the fee shall be made in compliance with application dates. Nothing in this subsection authorizes the commission to establish or retain a fee for resident moose or resident ram bighorn sheep license preference points in addition to the fee established by subsection (k) of this section or to establish rules for ram bighorn sheep or moose preference point drawings in conflict with the provisions of W.S. 23-1-703(b). For nonresident ram bighorn sheep and nonresident moose licenses, the commission may establish by rule a nonrefundable preference point fee to be withheld from either the license fee remitted or submitted separately when application for a license or preference point is made through electronic licensing and may establish a fee in lieu of making application in an amount greater than that established under subsection (k) of this section, but neither fee shall exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Fees established under this subsection may be set at lower amounts for youth license applicants.</p>
                  <p>(n) In addition to other fees under this section, persons applying for a license or tag under this section may pay any whole dollar amount to fund the purchase of access easements by the commission to provide access to public and private lands.</p>
                  <p>(o) For issuing each harvest information permit required under federal law license selling agents and commission employees shall charge the fee authorized by W.S. 23-1-701(b)(iii).</p>
                  <p>(p) In addition to other fees under this section, persons applying for a license or tag under this section may pay any whole dollar amount to support wildlife conservation efforts related to the transportation system. The department shall provide information on the application form that the applicant may pay the contribution under this subsection. Funds collected under this subsection shall be transmitted to the state treasurer to be credited to the wildlife conservation account created by W.S. 31-2-231(b). The department shall deduct and retain an amount equal to the administrative costs incurred in complying with this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(q) In addition to other fees under this section, persons applying for a license or tag under this section may pay a voluntary fee of two dollars ($2.00) or any greater amount to fund predator control activities in the state. The department shall provide information on the license or tag application form that the applicant may pay the fee under this subsection. Any voluntary fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in a separate account within the game and fish fund and shall only be expended as determined by the commission for management and control of predator populations and depredating animals. The commission may consider projects that mitigate damage caused to livestock, wildlife and crops by predatory animals, predacious birds and depredating animals or for the protection of human health and safety and may also use these funds for the purposes specified in W.S. 11-6-307 and 23-1-901. As used in this subsection, "depredating animal" means any trophy game animal or furbearing animal that causes damage. [NOTE: This section will be effective 1/1/2021.]</p>

                  <p>(c) No person fourteen (14) years of age or older shall take any game bird without obtaining the proper license.

                  <p>(d) No person holding an archery license shall take big game or trophy game animals during a special archery hunting season or during a limited quota archery only hunting season by the use of any type of firearm.

                  <p><shortTitle>23-2-303. Trapping licenses; tagging; traps and snares; penalty; confiscation; inspection; interference with trapping.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any person may, in the discretion of the department upon application and the payment of the proper fee, receive a license to trap any furbearing animal. The department shall issue a trapping license to a nonresident only if his state issues licenses to Wyoming residents to trap the same species for which residents of that state may be licensed to trap in that state. Any nonresident applying for a Wyoming trapping license shall furnish:</p>
                  <p>(i) A notarized affidavit stating the applicant's legal address including his state of residence; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) A copy of the most current statutes or rules and regulations of the applicant's state of residence which show that the state issues nonresident trapping licenses which authorize Wyoming residents to trap the same species for which residents of that state may be licensed to trap in that state.</p>
                  <p>(b) At the time of application for a trapping license, the department shall determine:</p>
                  <p>(i) The area in the district where the trapper may take furbearing animals;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Allowable harvests of furbearing animals within designated areas which may be taken in a given time.</p>
                  <p>(c) Repealed by Laws 1987, ch. 156, \xA7 2.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission, following consultation with other affected entities, may promulgate rules and regulations establishing specifications for snares, breakaway weights, location of breakaway devices, loop size and anchors for trapping and snaring of furbearing and predatory animals. All traps and snares used for furbearing or predatory animals shall be permanently marked or tagged with the name and address of the owner or the identification number assigned to the owner by the department. Any identification number attached to a trap or snare pursuant to this subsection is solely for the use of the department or appropriate law enforcement officers and is not a public record for purposes of W.S. 16-4-201 through 16-4-205. No trap or snare shall be set for furbearing or predatory animals within thirty (30) feet of any exposed bait or carcass over five (5) pounds in weight. As used in this subsection, "exposed bait or carcass" means the meat or viscera of any part of a mammal, bird or fish, excluding dried bones. All snares used for taking furbearing or predatory animals shall be equipped with a break-away device. Unless otherwise specified in this subsection, all steel-jawed leghold traps shall be checked by the owner at least once during each seventy-two (72) hour period unless extensions are granted by the department. All snares and quick kill body grip traps shall be checked by the owner not less than once each week unless extensions are granted by the department. All wildlife caught in any trap or snare shall upon discovery, be removed immediately by the owner.</p>
                  <p>Violation of this subsection constitutes a low misdemeanor punishable as provided in W.S. 23-6-202(a)(v).</p>
                  <p>(e) After the date gray wolves are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming as provided by W.S. 23-1-108 the commission may enact rules and regulations setting forth the specifications for traps and snares used for the taking of gray wolves and the time period for checking such traps and snares. Except as otherwise provided by commission rule, the provisions in this section regulating the trapping of furbearing and predatory animals shall apply to the trapping of gray wolves.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any trap or snare found in the field not bearing the name and address of the owner of the trap or snare or the identification number assigned by the department to the owner of the trap or snare may be confiscated by any employee of the department. Any landowner or his agent may inspect any trap or snare set on his property, may remove the trap or snare and may release or remove from the trap or snare any wildlife which has not been taken lawfully. The landowner or his agent shall notify the department of any such wildlife, excluding predatory animals, as soon as practicably possible after removing the wildlife from a trap or snare.</p>
                  <p>(g) A violation of this subsection constitutes a low misdemeanor punishable as provided in W.S. 23-6-202(a)(v). Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall intentionally:</p>
                  <p>(i) Tamper with or remove a trap or snare set and maintained in compliance with this act; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Release or remove a furbearer or predator from a trap or snare set and maintained in compliance with this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) No nonresident shall hunt big or trophy game animals on any designated wilderness area, as defined by federal or state law, in this state unless accompanied by a licensed professional guide or a resident guide. There shall be at least one (1) licensed professional guide or resident guide accompanying each two (2) nonresident hunters. The commission may also specify other areas of the state, or specific big or trophy game species, for which a licensed professional or resident guide is required for nonresidents, for purposes of proper game management, protection of hunter welfare and safety, or better enforcement of game and fish laws. The commission may allow licensed guides to accompany more than two (2) hunters but no more than six (6) hunters in specific areas.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any resident possessing a valid resident big or trophy game animal license may apply for and receive a resident guide license. The resident guide license shall be issued without charge or bond by the commission, any district supervisor or resident game warden upon receipt of an affidavit from the resident stating the names and addresses of the nonresident hunters to be guided, the game to be hunted, the area to be hunted, and that the resident has not received nor will accept directly or indirectly any compensation for his services as a guide. A resident guide shall not guide more than two (2) nonresident hunters in any calendar year on any national forest, wilderness area, national game refuge, or national park, except as provided in W.S. 23-2-401, nor shall he accept any compensation or gratuity for his services. An exchange of guide services shall not be considered compensation for the purposes of this section. The name and license number of the nonresident hunter shall be placed on the back of the resident guide license and stamped or signed by the issuer.</p>
                  <p>(c) A resident landowner may guide hunters on land owned by or deeded land leased to him without a guide license, or he may authorize nonresidents hunting without a guide on those lands. The license must bear the signature of the landowner, lessee, or agent of the owner on whose private property he is hunting as evidence that permission to hunt has been granted.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon the filing of the declaration the department shall investigate and require the applicant to produce satisfactory evidence of the facts stated in the declaration. The licensee shall purchase or replace to the state all game birds within the boundaries of the proposed farm and to effect this purpose, the department shall appoint one (1) man, the applicant one (1) man, and these two (2) shall select a third man, the three (3) to act as a board to go upon the lands embraced within the proposed license and determine as nearly as possible the number of wild game birds occupying the proposed tract. The determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date of the application for a license. The necessary expense of all of the members of the board shall be paid by the licensee. Within thirty (30) days after the date of the determination of the number of occupying game birds the licensee shall pay to the department a specified sum per bird as determined by the department or replace to the state an equivalent number of birds.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department shall issue a license to the applicant describing the lands, and certifying that the licensee is lawfully entitled to use the lands for the breeding, propagating, hunting, killing, and selling of licensed game birds thereon according to the provisions of this act if upon such examination it appears:</p>
                  <p>(i) The applicant is the owner or lessee of the lands;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The applicant intends in good faith to establish, operate, and maintain a commercial game bird farm, and raise and release additional game birds into the wild;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The area to be licensed is enclosed by a legal fence and posted as a "private game bird farm"; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The applicant has paid to the department the specified sum for game birds on the premises or replaced to the state an equivalent number of game birds.</p>
                  <p>(c) When a license has been granted, the licensee becomes the owner of all offspring of the game birds actually produced and remaining thereon. No person shall entice game birds into the licensed premises by baiting, artificial feeding or by any other means. All adult game birds released on the licensed premises shall be marked by identifying leg or wing bands. After three (3) years of continuous operation and licensure for the same location, the licensee shall not be required to mark adult game birds with identifying leg or wing bands. To be qualified as a licensee under this act, each licensee shall release a minimum of one hundred (100) game birds each year on the licensed premises, which number may be a combination of any species of game birds. Failure to release the minimum number of birds is cause for revocation of the license. The commission shall not limit by rule and regulation or policy the number or species of game birds a licensee may raise, possess, confine, transport or dispose of in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>

                  <p>(a) No person shall possess live greater sage grouse or propagate, breed, sell, raise or release greater sage grouse unless licensed as a game bird farm and certified to be in compliance with the requirements of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations for the administration of this section. The rules and regulations shall establish a system to certify game bird farm licensees to possess, propagate, breed, raise, sell, gather eggs of and release greater sage grouse and to take greater sage grouse within the boundaries of the game bird farm. A licensee shall be issued an annual certificate of compliance under this section by providing evidence to the department that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The licensee has successfully raised from eggs or chicks at least two (2) other species of game bird in accordance with this act for not less than three (3) consecutive years;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An adequate enclosure exists at the game bird farm to confine and handle greater sage grouse physically separated from other game birds;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The enclosures for greater sage grouse include vegetation consistent with the needs of the grouse;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The facility is disease free; and</p>
                  <p>(v) The licensee demonstrates the capacity to meet requirements specified in this section and commission rule for continuing operation as a certified greater sage grouse facility.</p>
                  <p>(c) To maintain certification under this section the licensee shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Submit an annual national poultry improvement plan certificate and annual avian influenza free certification by a licensed Wyoming veterinarian to the department;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Report within the time period established by rule the detection of any disease at the game bird farm to the department and undertake and report to the department remedial acts taken to mitigate the effects of any disease.</p>
                  <p>(d) Before release, greater sage grouse shall be banded for identification in accordance with rules and regulations of the commission and held in a holding pen separate from any sage grouse not being released and separate from any other game bird species for at least thirty (30) consecutive days immediately prior to release. Any greater sage grouse that dies within the release holding pen during this period shall be reported to the department within the time period and in accordance with the procedures established by rule shall be sent to the Wyoming state veterinary laboratory for necropsy at the expense of the licensee. Any release of greater sage grouse within the state and not within the boundaries of the game bird farm shall be in coordination with the department. Commission rules may restrict areas of release as necessary to protect existing wild populations of greater sage grouse.</p>
                  <p>(e) A game bird farm licensee holding a current certification under this section may collect greater sage grouse eggs for the purpose of establishing a captive breeding population, subject to the following restrictions:</p>
                  <p>(i) All collections shall be conducted by the licensee or his agent under the supervision of a professional wildlife biologist and in coordination with the department;</p>
                  <p>(ii) No more than two hundred fifty (250) eggs may be collected by any game bird farm licensee in any calendar year;</p>
                  <p>(iii) No more than forty (40) nest sites in a single collection area may be disturbed by the game bird farm licensee in any calendar year; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Eggs may only be collected in April and May;</p>
                  <p>(v) Rules shall establish:</p>
                  <p>(A) Time of day and restrictions on methods of collection of eggs;</p>
                  <p>(B) The number of licensees authorized to collect eggs;</p>
                  <p>(C) The areas approved for collection of eggs;</p>
                  <p>and</p>
                  <p>(D) Other limitations on egg collections, including the complete suspension of egg collections as determined by the commission to be beneficial to prevent the listing of or facilitate the removal of greater sage grouse as a candidate species under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
                  <p>(f) The department may suspend, revoke or not renew any certification issued to a licensee under this section if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the department finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) The licensee has violated any provision of this act or any rule promulgated under this act which relates to the licensee's game bird farm operations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The licensee's facilities no longer provide secure holding facilities to contain and separate game bird species as required under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The licensee's facility has not remained disease free and the department reasonably believes the native greater sage grouse population of this state may be harmed thereby.</p>
                  <p>(g) The requirements of this section for game bird farm certification for greater sage grouse are in addition to all other licensing requirements of this article.</p>
                  <p>(h) A licensee whose certification under this section has been revoked may not reapply for a new certification within eighteen (18) months of the date of revocation.</p>
                  <p>(j) Commission rules may provide for the forfeiture to the state or for other disposition of greater sage grouse at any facility whose certification under this section has been revoked. Certifications under this section shall expire as of December 31, 2022. Commission rules shall provide for disposition of all greater sage grouse held by a licensee pursuant to this section as of that date. No licensee shall be entitled to any reimbursement from or other claim against the state for any greater sage grouse owned by the licensee at the expiration or revocation of a certification and all certifications issued pursuant to this section shall so provide.</p>

                  <p>"Fishing preserve waters" means any artificial or man-made body of water not exceeding one hundred (100) surface acres, lying wholly within the boundaries of privately owned lands, operated for the purpose of permitting the owner to provide fishing facilities for fishermen. It does not include natural streams, natural ponds or waters impounded by the damming of natural streams with a normal stream flow in excess of five (5) second feet. It is unlawful to use such natural waters as a fishing preserve. The sources of water for fishing preserve waters are limited to surface runoff, natural springs, wells, or waters lawfully diverted from a natural stream, or the damming of natural streams with a normal stream flow of five (5) second feet or less.</p>

                  <p>(a) The department shall, after application and payment of the proper fee, issue to an owner of fishing preserve waters a fishing preserve license permitting the holder to manage the fishing preserve waters and to possess, rear and to take or permit others to take therefrom, fish acquired from any legal source. A separate license is required for each body of water defined in this act as fishing preserve waters. Two (2) or more ponds under one (1) ownership, supplied by one (1) common water source and located on one (1) continuous parcel of land, shall be considered as one (1) body of water requiring one (1) license.</p>
                  <p>(b) The license so issued shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Specify the species of fish authorized to be stocked therein;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Specify the source of acquisition of fish stocked therein;</p>

                  <p>(a) The court may, in its discretion, revoke any license issued under this act to any person convicted of a violation of this act, for the remainder of the year in which the conviction occurs, and may suspend the person's privilege to purchase or receive any other license under this act, or to take any wildlife for the following time periods provided in paragraphs</p>
                  <p>(i) through (iii) and shall suspend the person's privilege to purchase or receive any other license under this act for the time period provided in paragraph (iv) of this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(i) Not less than five (5) years for a conviction of any violation under W.S. 23-3-102(d);</p>

                  <p>(d) The court may revoke the privileges of a person convicted of a violation of this act to purchase or receive any license or take any wildlife prohibited by the court until all fines, costs and restitution imposed by the court are satisfied. Any person who violates this subsection shall be punished pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) "Conviction" means a determination of guilt by any Wyoming court having legal jurisdiction of the offense from which no appeal is legally perfected. Pleas of nolo contendere and forfeitures of bail shall be deemed convictions for the purposes of this act.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>23-6-302. Execution of Compact.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The legislature hereby approves and the governor is authorized to enter into a compact on behalf of this state with any other state or states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
                  <p>Article I</p>
                  <p>Findings, Declaration of Policy and Purpose</p>
                  <p>(a) The participating states find that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Wildlife is managed by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The protection of the wildlife of a state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances and administrative rules relating to the management of those resources;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The preservation, protection, management and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational and economic aspects of those natural resources;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Wildlife is valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management and restoration laws and ordinances and administrative rules and regulations of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap or possess wildlife as determined by local law;</p>
                  <p>(v) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife and may endanger the safety of persons and property;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states;</p>
                  <p>(vii) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than his home state:</p>
                  <p>(A) Is required to post collateral or a bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date;</p>
                  <p>(B) Is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.</p>
                  <p>(viii) The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph (vii) of this article is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the citation, could return to his home state and disregard his duty under the terms of the citation;</p>
                  <p>(ix) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in his home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on his way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation;</p>
                  <p>(x) The practices described in paragraph (vii) of this article cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made; and</p>
                  <p>(xi) The enforcement practices described in paragraph</p>
                  <p>(vii) of this article consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.</p>
                  <p>(b) It is the policy of the participating states to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife in their respective states;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and treat the suspension as if it had occurred in their state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Allow a violator, except as provided in subsection (b) of article III, to accept a wildlife citation and, without delay, proceed on his way, whether or not a resident of the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state;</p>
                  <p>(v) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though they had occurred in the home state;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one participating state to a resident of another participating state;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information; and</p>
                  <p>(viii) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.</p>
                  <p>(c) The purpose of this compact is to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide a means through which participating states may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in subsection (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within participating states in recognition of the violator's right to due process and the sovereign status of a participating state.</p>
                  <p>Article II Definitions</p>
                  <p>(a) As used in this compact, unless the context required otherwise:</p>

                  <p>(ii) "Collateral" means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial in connection with the issuance by a wildlife officer or other peace officer of a citation for a wildlife violation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Compliance" with respect to a citation means the act of answering a citation through an appearance in a court or tribunal or through the payment of fines, costs and surcharges, if any;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Conviction" means a conviction, including any court conviction, for any offense related to the preservation, protection, management or restoration of wildlife which is prohibited by state statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule, and such conviction shall also include the forfeiture of any bail, bond or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, the payment of a penalty assessment, a plea of nolo contendere and the imposition of a deferred or suspended sentence by the court;</p>
                  <p>(v) "Court" means a court of law, including magistrate's court;</p>
                  <p>(vi) "Home state" means the state of primary residence of a person;</p>
                  <p>(vii) "Issuing state" means the participating state which issues a wildlife citation to the violator;</p>
                  <p>(viii) "License" means any license, permit or other public document which conveys to the person to whom it was issued the privilege of pursuing, possessing or taking any wildlife regulated by statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule of a participating state;</p>
                  <p>(ix) "Licensing authority" means the department or division within each participating state which is authorized by law to issue or approve licenses or permits to hunt, fish, trap or possess wildlife;</p>
                  <p>(x) "Participating state" means any state which enacts legislation to become a member of this wildlife compact;</p>
                  <p>(xi) "Personal recognizance" means an agreement by a person made at the time of issuance of the wildlife citation that the person will comply with the terms of the citation;</p>
                  <p>(xii) "State" means any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Provinces of Canada and other countries;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) "Suspension" means any revocation, denial or withdrawal of any or all license privileges, including the privilege to apply for, purchase or exercise the benefits conferred by any license;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) "Terms of the citation" means those conditions and options expressly stated upon the citation;</p>
