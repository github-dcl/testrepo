                <p>(a) The board of county commissioners may elect to adopt one (1) or both of the following alternate procedures for casting, collecting and counting absentee ballots:</p>
                <p>(i) Direct that absentee ballots shall be delivered to and counted by at least three (3) judges appointed for that purpose under W.S. 22-8-107 instead of the procedures specified in this chapter for the delivery of absentee ballots to the separate precincts or designated counting centers. However, if this alternate procedure is used, the judges shall record the results by precinct and shall immediately certify the results to the county clerk;</p>
                <p>(ii) Direct that an absentee polling place may be established in the courthouse or other public building which is equipped to accommodate voters from all districts and precincts within the county and shall be open the same hours as the courthouse on normal business days during the time period allowed for absentee voting. If this alternate procedure is used, the county clerk may also establish in one (1) or more public buildings within the county additional satellite absentee polling places to accommodate voters. A satellite absentee polling place shall be open only on the dates and at the times specified by the county clerk during the time period allowed for absentee voting.</p>
                <p>(b) In the case of electronic voting systems using either alternate procedure provided in subsection (a) of this section, the ballots may be tabulated automatically and the ballot counts shall be entered at the designated counting center at the time the polls close on election day.</p>
                <p>(c) If either alternate voting procedure provided in subsection (a) of this section is sought to be used, the secretary of state is authorized to adopt rules and regulations to guard against abuses of the elective franchise to include such matters as contained in W.S. 22-26-113 through 22-26-115.</p>

                <p>(a) Before preparing a voting machine for an election, the county clerk shall notify in writing the county chairman of each political party having a candidate on the ballot and all independent candidates, stating the time and place where the voting machine will be prepared for the election. The political party representatives and representatives of independent candidates may be present at the preparation of the voting machine for the election, to see that the machine is tested for accuracy and is properly prepared and that all registering counters are set at zero (00000). The county clerk in the presence of these representatives shall prepare the voting machine for the election and set all registering counters at zero (00000). He shall then test each registering counter for accuracy by casting votes on it until the registering counter is correctly registering each vote cast on it. The county clerk shall then reset each registering counter to zero (00000) and shall immediately lock and seal the voting machine with a numbered metal seal and make a record of the number of the seal on the certificate for the machine. The seal shall be so placed as to prevent operation of the machine or its registering counters without breaking the seal. The county clerk shall then immediately make a record on the certificate for the machine of the reading shown on the protective counter.</p>
                <p>(b) Inspection of voting machines may begin two (2) weeks before an election and continue until all machines to be used are sealed. Immediately following testing of a machine, the county clerk shall make a certificate in writing stating the serial number of each machine, whether the machine has all the registering counters set at zero (00000), and whether the machine has been tested by voting on each registering counter to prove that each registering counter is in perfect and accurate condition, the number registered on the protective counter, and the number on the seal with which the machine is sealed against operation. This certificate shall be kept on file in the office of the county clerk.</p>

                <p>(a) All provisions of the Election Code governing the conduct of elections shall apply to elections in which electronic voting systems are used, except that the county clerk of any county in which an electronic voting system is used may make such modifications in ballot form as are necessary to facilitate the use of the electronic voting system and yet maintain the integrity of the election and the intent of the law.</p>
                <p>(b) The county clerk of each county using an electronic voting system shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Determine whether paper ballots, ballot cards or a combination of both will be used in each polling place;</p>

                <p>(iii) Before testing an electronic voting system for an election, notify the county chairman of each political party having a candidate on the ballot, stating the time and place of the test. The political party representatives and representatives of independent candidates may be present for the test, which shall be held at least two (2) weeks before the election. The test shall ascertain that the automatic tabulating equipment will accurately count the votes cast for all offices and all measures. The test shall be conducted by processing a preaudited group of paper ballots or ballot cards on which are recorded a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate and on each measure and shall include for each office one (1) or more ballots which have votes in excess of the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the automatic tabulating equipment to reject such votes. During the test a different number of valid votes shall be assigned to each candidate for an office, and for and against each measure. If any error is detected, the cause of it shall be ascertained and corrected and an errorless count shall be secured and certified to by the county clerk. On completion of the count, the programs, test materials and ballots shall be sealed and retained as provided for paper ballots;</p>

Damaged or defective ballots shall be delivered with the returns to the county clerk.</p>
                <p>(c) In addition to any other duties prescribed by law, election judges in polling places using an electronic voting system shall:</p>

                <p>(a) If a canvassing board is unable to determine which candidate has been elected or nominated, the canvassing board shall declare any part of the election results to be null and void as to that office and the county clerk shall call a special election to make a decision. For purposes of this section, a canvassing board shall be unable to determine which candidate is nominated or elected if:</p>

                <p>(ii) The error involves a number of votes that is equal to or greater than the number of votes separating the winning and losing candidates.</p>

                <p>(e) Any candidate may appeal the decision of the canvassing board to call or not to call a special election in the same manner as he would contest an election under this act. However, the appeal shall be filed in the district court no later than the first Monday following the meeting of the canvassing board where the decision being appealed was made.</p>
                <p>(f) The special election shall be held if necessary no later than the third Tuesday after the primary, general or other special election and may be held by a special mail ballot election as provided in W.S. 22-16-123. The special election shall be conducted by the county clerk as nearly as possible in the manner of a primary or general election, except only those registered in the precinct at the close of polls on the election day of the primary, general or other special election in question shall be permitted to vote in the special election. If the election is held as a special mail ballot election, the election shall be held as provided in W.S. 22-16-123.</p>
                <p>(g) Not more than fourteen (14) nor less than five (5) days before the special election the county clerk shall publish at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county a proclamation setting forth the date of the election, the offices to be filled at the election including the terms of the offices, the number of persons required by law to fill the offices, the requirements for filing statements of campaign contributions and expenditures, and any other pertinent information.</p>
                <p>(h) A court ordered election may be held by special mail ballot election as determined by the county clerk or by the secretary of state if the election involves more than one (1) county.</p>

                <p>(a) A special mail ballot election, as provided in this section, may be held in response to a determination under W.S. 22-16-122(a).</p>
                <p>(b) In a special mail ballot election, official ballots shall be prepared and all other pre-election procedures followed as otherwise provided by law or rules promulgated by the secretary of state, except that special mail ballot packets shall be prepared as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) The election official shall mail to each qualified elector entitled to vote in the special mail ballot election as described in W.S. 22-16-122(b) and (c), at the last address appearing in the registration records or to the address given on the absentee ballot application used for the primary, general or other special election ballot, a special mail ballot packet, which shall be marked "DO NOT FORWARD-ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED," or any other similar statement which is in accordance with United States postal service regulations. Packets shall be mailed not sooner than twenty-one (21) days and not later than fifteen (15) days before an election for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122. Packets shall be mailed not sooner than forty-five (45) days and not later than forty (40) days before an election for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122(h) unless the court order provides otherwise;</p>
                <p>(ii) The ballot shall contain the following warning:</p>
                <p>WARNING The criminal laws regulating the conduct of elections contained in chapter 26 of the Wyoming Election Code of 1973, as amended, apply with equal force to elections by mail.</p>
                <p>(iii) Not sooner than twenty-one (21) days and before 7:00 p.m. on election day for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122, mail ballots shall be made available at the election official's office for voters entitled to vote in the election but whose address has changed or who did not receive their ballot in the mail;</p>
                <p>(iv) A voter may obtain a replacement ballot if the ballot was destroyed, spoiled, lost or for some other reason not received by the voter. In order to obtain a replacement ballot, the voter shall sign a sworn statement specifying the reason for requesting the replacement ballot. The statement shall be presented to the election official no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day. The election official shall keep a record of each replacement ballot issued in accordance with this paragraph. A replacement ballot may be transmitted directly to the applicant at the election official's office or may be mailed to the voter at the address provided in the application. Replacement ballots may be cast no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day;</p>
                <p>(v) Upon receipt of a ballot, the voter shall mark the ballot, sign and complete the return-verification envelope and comply with the instructions provided with the ballot. The voter may return the marked ballot to the election official by United States mail or by depositing the ballot at the office of the election official or the designated depository no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day;</p>
                <p>(vi) Once the ballot is returned, it shall not be returned to the voter. The election official shall first qualify the submitted ballot by examining the verification envelope and comparing the information on the envelope to the poll list to determine whether the ballot was submitted by a voter who has not previously voted in the election. If the ballot so qualifies and is otherwise valid, the official shall place a number next to the voter's name in the poll book. The election official shall then open and separate the ballot from the envelope and place the ballot in a ballot box so as to keep the voter's ballot private;</p>
                <p>(vii) All deposited ballots shall be counted as provided in this act and rules promulgated by the secretary of state. A special mail ballot shall be valid and counted only if is returned in the return-verification envelope, the affidavit on the envelope is signed by the voter to whom the ballot was issued and the information on the envelope is verified as provided in paragraph (vi) of this subsection. If the election official determines that a voter to whom a replacement ballot has been issued has voted more than once, the official shall only count the first ballot received from that voter;</p>
                <p>(viii) The election official shall provide a minimum of one (1) polling place on the day of election which may be the election official's office and shall be open between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.</p>
                <p>(c) If any special mail ballot packet mailed under paragraph (b)(i) of this section to a physical address, not including a post office box, is returned by the postal service, the county clerk shall investigate the validity of the address. If the county clerk determines that the address is not at a location that a voter could inhabit, the county clerk shall remove the address from the registration records until the county clerk receives proof that the address is habitable by a voter.</p>

The meeting shall be held not later than fifteen (15) days after the state central committee is notified of the vacancy. The state central committee of each political party shall establish procedures for conducting the vote required under this subparagraph and may delegate the authority to call the meeting required under this subparagraph;</p>
                <p>(B) The state central committee of the political party of the former incumbent shall submit the list selected under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to the board of county commissioners for each county in which the legislative district is located.

                <p>(C) If the incumbent who has vacated office did not represent a political party at the time of his election under W.S. 22-6-120(a)(vii), or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, the county commissioners shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph.

                <p>(D) If the legislative district is in more than one (1) county, the vacancy shall be filled by the combined vote of the boards of county commissioners for those counties. The vote of each county commissioner in attendance shall be weighted so that the total vote of the commissioners from each county shall be in proportion to the population of the legislative district within that county. For vacancies created other than by resignation, if the legislative district is in more than one (1) county, the determination of the vacancy shall be made in accordance with this subparagraph.</p>

Within thirty (30) days after the petition is filed the judge shall fill the vacancy by appointing a person residing in the county or legislative district belonging to the same political party as the incumbent represented at the time of his election under W.S. 22-6-120(a)(vii), or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, who is qualified to hold the office. If the incumbent did not represent any political party at the time of his election or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, the judge may appoint any person residing in the county or legislative district who is qualified to hold the office to fill the vacancy.</p>
                <p>(b) The trustees of a school or community college district shall fill a vacancy in office by temporary appointment in a manner provided by law. If the trustees fail to appoint a person qualified to hold the office to fill a vacancy within thirty (30) days from the date the vacancy occurs, or if, for any reason, the entire membership of the board of trustees of a school or community college district is depleted, the board of county commissioners of the county or counties involved, within ten (10) days of either occurrence, shall appoint a person qualified to hold the office to fill each vacancy until the next election at which time an election shall be held to fill the unexpired term, and each appointee shall serve until his successor is elected and qualified. Each appointee shall be a resident of the trustee residence area, or election subdistrict, if any, previously represented.</p>
                <p>(c) For purposes of this section:</p>

                  <p>(a) In an initiative, the proposed bill shall be confined to one (1) subject, the entire subject of the bill shall be expressed in the title, the enacting clause shall be: "Be it enacted by the people of the state of Wyoming:" and the bill shall not include subjects restricted by W.S. 22-24-301.</p>
                  <p>(b) In an initiative, concurrently with the filing of the application, the proposed bill shall be submitted by the committee of applicants to the secretary of state for review and comment. The proposed bill shall be in the format required for bills by W.S. 8-1-105. If the secretary of state determines that the proposed bill is not in the format required, he shall provide the committee of applicants a copy of W.S. 8-1-105 and an example bill meeting the format, and shall request the committee revise and resubmit the proposed bill. Upon request of the secretary of state, the legislative service office or any agency in the executive department shall render assistance in reviewing and preparing comments on the proposed bill. No later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of submission, at a conference scheduled by the secretary of state, the secretary shall render to the committee of applicants comments on any problems encountered concerning the format or contents of the proposed bill. If the legislature is in session at the time the conference would otherwise be required to be held, then the conference shall be held within ten (10) days after the adjournment of the session.

After the conference but before certification the committee of applicants may amend the proposed bill in response to some or all of the comments of the secretary of state and resubmit the proposed bill in accordance with this subsection, or they may disregard the comments entirely. The committee of applicants shall notify the secretary of state in writing within five (5) calendar days after the conference whether the proposed bill will be amended. If the proposed bill is to be amended it shall be resubmitted for review and comment in accordance with this subsection. At any time the committee of applicants chooses not to amend or further amend a proposed bill, the committee of applicants may submit the proposed bill to the secretary of state for certification.</p>
                  <p>(c) No later than thirty (30) days after a proposed bill is submitted for certification, the committee of applicants shall submit to the secretary of state the names, signatures, addresses and the date of signing of one hundred (100) qualified registered voters who will act as sponsors supporting the application and proposed bill in their final form. The committee of applicants may act as sponsors if duly qualified. The thirty (30) day requirement of this subsection shall be extended by the number of days any conference under subsection (b) of this section is delayed as a result of abatement of the conference during a legislative session.</p>
                  <p>(d) The legislative service office shall provide the secretary of state's office with a template of the format required for bills by W.S. 8-1-105. The secretary of state shall make the template available to the public in an electronic format on the official secretary of state website.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon the certification or conditional certification of any initiative application, if in the opinion of the secretary of state the proposed bill will have a fiscal impact on the state, the secretary of state shall prepare an estimate and explanation of the fiscal impact. The explanation shall include a statement that it is an estimate of fiscal impact to the state only and does not include an estimate of any impact upon political subdivisions. Upon request of the secretary of state, any agency in the executive department shall render assistance in preparing the estimate and explanation of fiscal impact.</p>
                  <p>(b) No later than fourteen (14) days after final certification of an initiative application, the secretary of state shall render to the committee of applicants its fiscal impact estimate and explanation. If the committee believes that the secretary of state's estimate is inaccurate, within fourteen (14) days after receiving the secretary of state's estimate and explanation, the committee of applicants may submit to the secretary of state its own estimate and explanation of fiscal impact. Upon receiving the committee of applicants' estimate and explanation, the secretary of state may revise its estimate if in the opinion of the secretary of state the committee demonstrates that the secretary of state's estimate is inaccurate. If the final estimated fiscal impact by the secretary of state and the final estimated fiscal impact by the committee of applicants differ by more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), the secretary of state's comments under the ballot proposition shall contain an estimated range of fiscal impact reflecting both estimates.</p>

                  <p>(iv) The ballot shall contain the following warning:</p>
                  <p>WARNING</p>

In order to obtain a replacement ballot, the voter must sign a sworn statement specifying the reason for requesting the replacement ballot. The statement shall be presented to the election official no later than 4:00 p.m. on election day. The election official shall keep a record of each replacement ballot issued in accordance with this section together with a list of each ballot obtained pursuant to this section.

                  <p>(viii) Once the ballot is returned, an election official shall first qualify the submitted ballot by examining the verification envelope and comparing the information on the envelope to the poll list to determine whether the ballot was submitted by a voter who has not previously voted in the election. If the ballot so qualifies, and is otherwise valid, the official shall enter the name of the registered voter in the poll book, open the return-verification envelope and deposit the ballot in an official ballot box;</p>
                  <p>(ix) All deposited ballots shall be counted as provided in this act and by rules promulgated by the secretary of state.

                  <p>If the election official determines that a voter to whom a replacement ballot has been issued has voted more than once, the official shall not count any ballot cast by that voter.</p>
                  <p>(b) The election official responsible for conducting the election shall provide a minimum of one (1) polling place on the day of election which may be the election official's office or the county clerk's office and shall be open for not less than five (5) consecutive hours at any time between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. as set forth in the notice of election.</p>

                  <p>(i) For enlargement elections, the voters of both the existing district and the area to be added shall be entitled to vote;</p>

The directors shall thereupon constitute a board of trustees under the supervision of county commissioners, who shall pay the debts or procure releases thereof and dispose of the property of the district. If the dissolved district was located wholly within the limits of one (1) county, the board of the dissolving district may designate the county commissioners as the board of trustees for the purpose of winding up the affairs of the district. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition is against dissolution, the district directors shall declare the proposal defeated and cause the result of the vote to be made a part of the records of the district. In either case, the results of the election shall be certified to the county commissioners immediately after the canvass of the vote.</p>
                  <p>(b) If dissolution is approved after the affairs of the district have been fully settled all books and records of the district shall be deposited by the board of trustees in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the greatest area of the district was located. At the same time, the board of trustees shall execute under oath and file with the county commissioners a statement that the district has been dissolved and its affairs liquidated. From the date of the statement, the corporate existence of the district is terminated for all purposes.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition are against dissolution, no further election for dissolution shall be called by the directors, upon petition or upon a resolution of the commissioners, prior to the expiration of one (1) year from the date of the election on dissolution.</p>

If the surplus funds are distributed under this paragraph, the surplus funds shall be deposited in the unsegregated tax collections account established and distributed in the same manner as other funds in that account.</p>
