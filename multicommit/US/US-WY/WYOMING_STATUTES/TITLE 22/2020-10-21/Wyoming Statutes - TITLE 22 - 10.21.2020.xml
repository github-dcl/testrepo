                <p>(a) The board of county commissioners may elect to adopt one (1) or both of the following alternate procedures for casting, collecting and counting absentee ballots:</p>
                <p>(i) Direct that absentee ballots shall be delivered to and counted by at least three (3) judges appointed for that purpose under W.S. 22-8-107 instead of the procedures specified in this chapter for the delivery of absentee ballots to the separate precincts or designated counting centers. However, if this alternate procedure is used, the judges shall record the results by precinct and shall immediately certify the results to the county clerk;</p>
                <p>(ii) Direct that an absentee polling place may be established in the courthouse or other public building which is equipped to accommodate voters from all districts and precincts within the county and shall be open the same hours as the courthouse on normal business days during the time period allowed for absentee voting. If this alternate procedure is used, the county clerk may also establish in one (1) or more public buildings within the county additional satellite absentee polling places to accommodate voters. A satellite absentee polling place shall be open only on the dates and at the times specified by the county clerk during the time period allowed for absentee voting.</p>
                <p>(b) In the case of electronic voting systems using either alternate procedure provided in subsection (a) of this section, the ballots may be tabulated automatically and the ballot counts shall be entered at the designated counting center at the time the polls close on election day.</p>
                <p>(c) If either alternate voting procedure provided in subsection (a) of this section is sought to be used, the secretary of state is authorized to adopt rules and regulations to guard against abuses of the elective franchise to include such matters as contained in W.S. 22-26-113 through 22-26-115.</p>

                <p>(a) Before preparing a voting machine for an election, the county clerk shall notify in writing the county chairman of each political party having a candidate on the ballot and all independent candidates, stating the time and place where the voting machine will be prepared for the election. The political party representatives and representatives of independent candidates may be present at the preparation of the voting machine for the election, to see that the machine is tested for accuracy and is properly prepared and that all registering counters are set at zero (00000). The county clerk in the presence of these representatives shall prepare the voting machine for the election and set all registering counters at zero (00000). He shall then test each registering counter for accuracy by casting votes on it until the registering counter is correctly registering each vote cast on it. The county clerk shall then reset each registering counter to zero (00000) and shall immediately lock and seal the voting machine with a numbered metal seal and make a record of the number of the seal on the certificate for the machine. The seal shall be so placed as to prevent operation of the machine or its registering counters without breaking the seal. The county clerk shall then immediately make a record on the certificate for the machine of the reading shown on the protective counter.</p>
                <p>(b) Inspection of voting machines may begin two (2) weeks before an election and continue until all machines to be used are sealed. Immediately following testing of a machine, the county clerk shall make a certificate in writing stating the serial number of each machine, whether the machine has all the registering counters set at zero (00000), and whether the machine has been tested by voting on each registering counter to prove that each registering counter is in perfect and accurate condition, the number registered on the protective counter, and the number on the seal with which the machine is sealed against operation. This certificate shall be kept on file in the office of the county clerk.</p>

                <p>(a) If a canvassing board is unable to determine which candidate has been elected or nominated, the canvassing board shall declare any part of the election results to be null and void as to that office and the county clerk shall call a special election to make a decision. For purposes of this section, a canvassing board shall be unable to determine which candidate is nominated or elected if:</p>

                <p>(ii) The error involves a number of votes that is equal to or greater than the number of votes separating the winning and losing candidates.</p>
                <p>(b) The canvassing board shall determine which precincts will be involved in the special election. If the candidates' office is voted on across county lines, the canvassing board of all counties involved shall meet to determine the criteria for the special election.</p>

                <p>(e) Any candidate may appeal the decision of the canvassing board to call or not to call a special election in the same manner as he would contest an election under this act. However, the appeal shall be filed in the district court no later than the first Monday following the meeting of the canvassing board where the decision being appealed was made.</p>
                <p>(f) The special election shall be held if necessary no later than the third Tuesday after the primary, general or other special election and may be held by a special mail ballot election as provided in W.S. 22-16-123. The special election shall be conducted by the county clerk as nearly as possible in the manner of a primary or general election, except only those registered in the precinct at the close of polls on the election day of the primary, general or other special election in question shall be permitted to vote in the special election. If the election is held as a special mail ballot election, the election shall be held as provided in W.S. 22-16-123.</p>
                <p>(g) Not more than fourteen (14) nor less than five (5) days before the special election the county clerk shall publish at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county a proclamation setting forth the date of the election, the offices to be filled at the election including the terms of the offices, the number of persons required by law to fill the offices, the requirements for filing statements of campaign contributions and expenditures, and any other pertinent information.</p>
                <p>(h) A court ordered election may be held by special mail ballot election as determined by the county clerk or by the secretary of state if the election involves more than one (1) county.</p>

                <p>(a) A special mail ballot election, as provided in this section, may be held in response to a determination under W.S. 22-16-122(a).</p>
                <p>(b) In a special mail ballot election, official ballots shall be prepared and all other pre-election procedures followed as otherwise provided by law or rules promulgated by the secretary of state, except that special mail ballot packets shall be prepared as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) The election official shall mail to each qualified elector entitled to vote in the special mail ballot election as described in W.S. 22-16-122(b) and (c), at the last address appearing in the registration records or to the address given on the absentee ballot application used for the primary, general or other special election ballot, a special mail ballot packet, which shall be marked "DO NOT FORWARD-ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED," or any other similar statement which is in accordance with United States postal service regulations. Packets shall be mailed not sooner than twenty-one (21) days and not later than fifteen (15) days before an election for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122. Packets shall be mailed not sooner than forty-five (45) days and not later than forty (40) days before an election for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122(h) unless the court order provides otherwise;</p>
                <p>(ii) The ballot shall contain the following warning:</p>
                <p>WARNING The criminal laws regulating the conduct of elections contained in chapter 26 of the Wyoming Election Code of 1973, as amended, apply with equal force to elections by mail.</p>
                <p>(iii) Not sooner than twenty-one (21) days and before 7:00 p.m. on election day for elections held in accordance with W.S. 22-16-122, mail ballots shall be made available at the election official's office for voters entitled to vote in the election but whose address has changed or who did not receive their ballot in the mail;</p>
                <p>(iv) A voter may obtain a replacement ballot if the ballot was destroyed, spoiled, lost or for some other reason not received by the voter. In order to obtain a replacement ballot, the voter shall sign a sworn statement specifying the reason for requesting the replacement ballot. The statement shall be presented to the election official no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day. The election official shall keep a record of each replacement ballot issued in accordance with this paragraph. A replacement ballot may be transmitted directly to the applicant at the election official's office or may be mailed to the voter at the address provided in the application. Replacement ballots may be cast no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day;</p>
                <p>(v) Upon receipt of a ballot, the voter shall mark the ballot, sign and complete the return-verification envelope and comply with the instructions provided with the ballot. The voter may return the marked ballot to the election official by United States mail or by depositing the ballot at the office of the election official or the designated depository no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day;</p>
                <p>(vi) Once the ballot is returned, it shall not be returned to the voter. The election official shall first qualify the submitted ballot by examining the verification envelope and comparing the information on the envelope to the poll list to determine whether the ballot was submitted by a voter who has not previously voted in the election. If the ballot so qualifies and is otherwise valid, the official shall place a number next to the voter's name in the poll book. The election official shall then open and separate the ballot from the envelope and place the ballot in a ballot box so as to keep the voter's ballot private;</p>
                <p>(vii) All deposited ballots shall be counted as provided in this act and rules promulgated by the secretary of state. A special mail ballot shall be valid and counted only if is returned in the return-verification envelope, the affidavit on the envelope is signed by the voter to whom the ballot was issued and the information on the envelope is verified as provided in paragraph (vi) of this subsection. If the election official determines that a voter to whom a replacement ballot has been issued has voted more than once, the official shall only count the first ballot received from that voter;</p>
                <p>(viii) The election official shall provide a minimum of one (1) polling place on the day of election which may be the election official's office and shall be open between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.</p>
                <p>(c) If any special mail ballot packet mailed under paragraph (b)(i) of this section to a physical address, not including a post office box, is returned by the postal service, the county clerk shall investigate the validity of the address. If the county clerk determines that the address is not at a location that a voter could inhabit, the county clerk shall remove the address from the registration records until the county clerk receives proof that the address is habitable by a voter.</p>

                <p>(i) If a vacancy occurs in the office of United States senator or in any state office other than the governor, member of the state legislature, the office of justice of the supreme court and the office of district court judge, the governor shall immediately notify in writing the chairman of the state central committee of the political party which the last incumbent represented at the time of his election under W.S. 22-6-120(a)(vii), or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office. The chairman shall call a meeting of the state central committee to be held not later than fifteen (15) days after he receives notice of the vacancy. At the meeting the state central committee shall select and transmit to the governor the names of three (3) persons qualified to hold the office. Within five (5) days after receiving these three (3) names, the governor shall fill the vacancy by temporary appointment of one (1) of the three (3) to hold the office. If the incumbent who has vacated office did not represent a political party at the time of his election, or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, the governor shall notify in writing the chairman of all state central committees of parties registered with the secretary of state. The state central committees shall submit to the governor, within fifteen (15) days after notice of the vacancy, the name of one (1) person qualified to hold the office. The governor shall also cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the state notice of the vacancy in office. Persons qualified to hold the office who do not belong to a party may, within fifteen (15) days after publication of the vacancy in office, submit a petition signed by one hundred (100) registered voters, seeking consideration for appointment to the office. Within five (5) days after receiving the names of persons qualified to hold the office, the governor shall fill the vacancy by temporary appointment to the office, from the names submitted or from those petitioning for appointment;</p>
                <p>(ii) If a vacancy occurs in a county elective office, except as provided in W.S. 18-3-524, the board of county commissioners of the county in which the vacancy occurs shall immediately notify in writing the chairman of the county central committee of the political party which the last incumbent represented at the time of his election under W.S. 22-6-120(a)(vii), or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office. The chairman shall call a meeting of the county central committee to be held not later than fifteen (15) days after he receives notice of the vacancy. At the meeting the county central committee shall select and transmit to the board of county commissioners the names of three (3) persons qualified to hold the office. Within five (5) days after receiving these three (3) names, the board of county commissioners shall fill the vacancy by appointment of one (1) of the three (3) to hold the office. If the incumbent who has vacated office did not represent a political party at the time of his election, or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, the county commissioners shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, notice that within fifteen (15) days after publication any person qualified to hold the office may make application directly to the county commissioners for appointment to fill the vacancy. Within twenty (20) days after the publication of the vacancy in office the county commissioners shall fill the vacancy by appointment of one (1) person qualified to hold the office from those submitting applications;</p>
                <p>(iii) If a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the state legislature:</p>
                <p>(A) For vacancies other than resignations, the board of county commissioners of the county or counties in which the vacancy occurs shall immediately notify in writing the chairman of the state central committee of the political party which the former incumbent represented at the time of his election under W.S. 22-6-120(a)(vii), or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office. For resignations, the governor shall notify the appropriate state central committee or the appropriate board of county commissioners in accordance with W.S. 28-1-106. For all vacancies in which the incumbent represented a political party at the time of his election or appointment to the office, the state central committee of the political party of the former incumbent shall notify the precinct committeemen and committeewomen for that party for each precinct within the legislative district which is vacant and arrange a meeting of those precinct committeemen and committeewomen at which they will select a list of three (3) persons qualified to hold the office to fill the vacancy. Only those persons serving as committeemen and committeewomen at least thirty (30) days prior to the vacancy, or if the vacancy occurs within thirty (30) days after the first Monday in January in odd-numbered years, those precinct committeemen and committeewomen elected at the immediate past primary election and those selected by appointment prior to December 2 of the year in which the election occurred for vacant positions, shall be authorized to vote under this subparagraph. The meeting shall be held not later than fifteen (15) days after the state central committee is notified of the vacancy. The state central committee of each political party shall establish procedures for conducting the vote required under this subparagraph and may delegate the authority to call the meeting required under this subparagraph;</p>
                <p>(B) The state central committee of the political party of the former incumbent shall submit the list selected under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to the board of county commissioners for each county in which the legislative district is located. Within five (5) days after receiving the list of three (3) names, the board of county commissioners shall fill the vacancy by appointment of one (1) of the three (3) to hold the office;</p>
                <p>(C) If the incumbent who has vacated office did not represent a political party at the time of his election under W.S. 22-6-120(a)(vii), or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, the county commissioners shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph. The county commissioners shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, notice that within fifteen (15) days after publication, any person qualified to hold the office may make application directly to the county commissioners for appointment to fill the vacancy. Within twenty (20) days after publication of the notice of the vacancy in office, the county commissioners shall fill the vacancy by appointing one (1) person qualified to hold the office from among those submitting applications;</p>
                <p>(D) If the legislative district is in more than one (1) county, the vacancy shall be filled by the combined vote of the boards of county commissioners for those counties. The vote of each county commissioner in attendance shall be weighted so that the total vote of the commissioners from each county shall be in proportion to the population of the legislative district within that county. For vacancies created other than by resignation, if the legislative district is in more than one (1) county, the determination of the vacancy shall be made in accordance with this subparagraph.</p>
                <p>(iv) A vacancy in the office of any hospital district trustee or in any other special district office shall be filled by temporary appointment by the governing body of the hospital or special district, both subject to chapter 29 of this title;</p>
                <p>(v) A vacancy in a municipal office shall be filled as provided by W.S. 15-1-107;</p>
                <p>(vi) If the county commissioners fail to fill any vacancy as required in this section within the time specified, any person residing in the county or legislative district who is qualified to hold the office may file a petition with the clerk of the district court of the county or legislative district in which the vacancy occurred requesting the judge of the district court to fill the vacancy. Within thirty (30) days after the petition is filed the judge shall fill the vacancy by appointing a person residing in the county or legislative district belonging to the same political party as the incumbent represented at the time of his election under W.S. 22-6-120(a)(vii), or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, who is qualified to hold the office. If the incumbent did not represent any political party at the time of his election or at the time of his appointment if not elected to office, the judge may appoint any person residing in the county or legislative district who is qualified to hold the office to fill the vacancy.</p>
                <p>(b) The trustees of a school or community college district shall fill a vacancy in office by temporary appointment in a manner provided by law. If the trustees fail to appoint a person qualified to hold the office to fill a vacancy within thirty (30) days from the date the vacancy occurs, or if, for any reason, the entire membership of the board of trustees of a school or community college district is depleted, the board of county commissioners of the county or counties involved, within ten (10) days of either occurrence, shall appoint a person qualified to hold the office to fill each vacancy until the next election at which time an election shall be held to fill the unexpired term, and each appointee shall serve until his successor is elected and qualified. Each appointee shall be a resident of the trustee residence area, or election subdistrict, if any, previously represented.</p>
                <p>(c) For purposes of this section:</p>
                <p>(i) A person shall be considered to represent a political party if he was a nominee of that political party when elected to office or when appointed to fill a vacancy in office;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Qualified to hold the office" means a person meets all applicable qualifications to be elected to a public office which are set forth in the United States and Wyoming constitutions and Wyoming law, as applicable, on the date of the person's appointment to the public office.</p>

The proposed bill shall be in the format required for bills by W.S. 8-1-105. If the secretary of state determines that the proposed bill is not in the format required, he shall provide the committee of applicants a copy of W.S. 8-1-105 and an example bill meeting the format, and shall request the committee revise and resubmit the proposed bill. Upon request of the secretary of state, the legislative service office or any agency in the executive department shall render assistance in reviewing and preparing comments on the proposed bill. No later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of submission, at a conference scheduled by the secretary of state, the secretary shall render to the committee of applicants comments on any problems encountered concerning the format or contents of the proposed bill.

If the proposed bill is to be amended it shall be resubmitted for review and comment in accordance with this subsection. At any time the committee of applicants chooses not to amend or further amend a proposed bill, the committee of applicants may submit the proposed bill to the secretary of state for certification.</p>
                  <p>(c) No later than thirty (30) days after a proposed bill is submitted for certification, the committee of applicants shall submit to the secretary of state the names, signatures, addresses and the date of signing of one hundred (100) qualified registered voters who will act as sponsors supporting the application and proposed bill in their final form. The committee of applicants may act as sponsors if duly qualified.

                  <p>(d) The legislative service office shall provide the secretary of state's office with a template of the format required for bills by W.S. 8-1-105.

                  <p>(a) Upon the certification or conditional certification of any initiative application, if in the opinion of the secretary of state the proposed bill will have a fiscal impact on the state, the secretary of state shall prepare an estimate and explanation of the fiscal impact. The explanation shall include a statement that it is an estimate of fiscal impact to the state only and does not include an estimate of any impact upon political subdivisions. Upon request of the secretary of state, any agency in the executive department shall render assistance in preparing the estimate and explanation of fiscal impact.</p>
                  <p>(b) No later than fourteen (14) days after final certification of an initiative application, the secretary of state shall render to the committee of applicants its fiscal impact estimate and explanation. If the committee believes that the secretary of state's estimate is inaccurate, within fourteen (14) days after receiving the secretary of state's estimate and explanation, the committee of applicants may submit to the secretary of state its own estimate and explanation of fiscal impact. Upon receiving the committee of applicants' estimate and explanation, the secretary of state may revise its estimate if in the opinion of the secretary of state the committee demonstrates that the secretary of state's estimate is inaccurate. If the final estimated fiscal impact by the secretary of state and the final estimated fiscal impact by the committee of applicants differ by more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), the secretary of state's comments under the ballot proposition shall contain an estimated range of fiscal impact reflecting both estimates.</p>

                  <p>If the election official determines that a voter to whom a replacement ballot has been issued has voted more than once, the official shall not count any ballot cast by that voter.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon canvassing the vote after the election, if it appears that a majority or more of the votes on the proposition approve dissolution, the district directors shall declare the district dissolved. The directors shall thereupon constitute a board of trustees under the supervision of county commissioners, who shall pay the debts or procure releases thereof and dispose of the property of the district. If the dissolved district was located wholly within the limits of one (1) county, the board of the dissolving district may designate the county commissioners as the board of trustees for the purpose of winding up the affairs of the district. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition is against dissolution, the district directors shall declare the proposal defeated and cause the result of the vote to be made a part of the records of the district. In either case, the results of the election shall be certified to the county commissioners immediately after the canvass of the vote.</p>
                  <p>(b) If dissolution is approved after the affairs of the district have been fully settled all books and records of the district shall be deposited by the board of trustees in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the greatest area of the district was located. At the same time, the board of trustees shall execute under oath and file with the county commissioners a statement that the district has been dissolved and its affairs liquidated. From the date of the statement, the corporate existence of the district is terminated for all purposes.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition are against dissolution, no further election for dissolution shall be called by the directors, upon petition or upon a resolution of the commissioners, prior to the expiration of one (1) year from the date of the election on dissolution.</p>

If the surplus funds are distributed under this paragraph, the surplus funds shall be deposited in the unsegregated tax collections account established and distributed in the same manner as other funds in that account.</p>
