                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this act, an offer or sale of a security by an issuer is exempt from the requirements of W.S. 17-4-301 through 17-4-306 and 17-4-504 if the offer or sale meets all of the following requirements:</p>
                  <p>(i) The issuer of the security is:</p>
                  <p>(A) An entity that is incorporated or organized under the laws of this state;</p>
                  <p>(B) A resident of this state under securities and exchange commission rule 147, (17 C.F.R. 230.147), or rule 147A, (17 C.F.R. 230.147A); and</p>
                  <p>(C) Authorized to do business in this state.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The transaction meets the requirements for the federal exemption for intrastate offerings under section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(11)), and securities and exchange commission rule 147, (17 C.F.R. 230.147), including, but not limited to, the requirements for determining whether an offeree or purchaser is a resident of this state, or under 15 U.S.C. 77e and securities and exchange commission rule 147A, (17 C.F.R. 230.147A). All of the following apply concerning these requirements:</p>
                  <p>(A) Each of the following is prima facie evidence that an individual is a resident of this state:</p>
                  <p>(I) A valid operator's license, chauffeur's license, or official personal identification card issued by this state;</p>
                  <p>(II) A current Wyoming voter registration;</p>
                  <p>(III) A signed affidavit showing that the purchaser is a resident of this state as defined by W.S. 22-1-102(a)(xxx); or</p>
                  <p>(IV) Any other record or documents issued by this state that establishes that the purchaser's principal residence is in this state.</p>

                  <p>(C) If a purchaser of a security that is exempt under this section resells that security within six (6) months after the closing of the particular offering in which the purchaser obtained that security to a person that is not a resident of this state, the original investment agreement between the issuer and the purchaser is void. If an agreement to purchase, or the purchase of, a security is void under this subparagraph, the issuer may recover damages from the misrepresenting offeree or purchaser. These damages include, but are not limited to, the issuer's expenses in resolving the misrepresentation. However, damages described in this subparagraph shall not exceed the amount of the person's investment in the security.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The sum of all cash and other consideration to be received for all sales of the security in reliance on this exemption does not exceed the following amounts:</p>

                  <p>(B) Four million dollars ($4,000,000.00), less the aggregate amount received for all sales of securities by the issuer within the twelve (12) months before the first offer or sale made in reliance on this exemption, if the issuer has made available to each prospective purchaser and the secretary of state audited financial statements or reviewed financial statements for the issuer's most recently completed fiscal year, prepared by a certified public accountant, holding a certificate pursuant to W.S. 33-3-109, in accordance with the statements on auditing standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or the statements on standards for accounting and review services of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as applicable.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The issuer has not accepted more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) from any single purchaser unless the purchaser is an accredited investor as defined by rule 501 of securities and exchange commission regulation D, (17 C.F.R. 230.501) who comes within any category listed in the definition of that rule or who the issuer reasonably believes comes within any category listed in the definition of that rule, at the time of the sale.

                  <p>"IN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION, PURCHASERS MUST RELY ON THEIR OWN EXAMINATION OF THE ISSUER AND THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING, INCLUDING THE MERITS AND RISKS INVOLVED. THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED BY ANY FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY. FURTHERMORE, THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OR DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THIS DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

                  <p>(ii) The issuer establishes that it made factual inquiry into whether any disqualification existed under this subsection but did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, that a disqualification existed under this subsection. The nature and scope of the requisite inquiry will vary based on the circumstances of the issuer and the other offering participants.</p>
                  <p>(e) The secretary of state may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section and to protect purchasers that purchase securities that are exempt from registration under this section.</p>

                  <p>(v) It does not engage in any other activities that the secretary of state by rule determines are inappropriate for an exemption from the registration requirements under article 4 of this act.</p>
                  <p>(h) Except for W.S. 17-4-504, article 5 of this act applies to a violation of this section, including a violation concerning website operation.</p>

                  <p>(a) With respect to a federal covered security, as defined in section 18(b)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. § 77r(b)(2)), that is not otherwise exempt under W.S. 17-4-201 through 17-4-204, a rule adopted or order issued under this act may require the filing of any or all of the following records:</p>
                  <p>(i) Before the initial offer of a federal covered security in this state, all records that are part of a federal registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and a consent to service of process complying with W.S. 17-4-611 signed by the issuer and the payment of a fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00);</p>
                  <p>(ii) After the initial offer of the federal covered security in this state, all records that are part of an amendment to a federal registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under the Securities Act of 1933; and</p>

                  <p>(b) A notice filing under subsection (a) of this section is effective for two (2) years commencing on the later of the notice filing or the effectiveness of the offering filed with the securities and exchange commission. On or before expiration, the issuer may renew a notice filing by filing a copy of those records filed by the issuer with the securities and exchange commission that are required by rule or order under this act to be filed and by paying a renewal fee as set by rule. A previously filed consent to service of process complying with W.S. 17-4-611 may be incorporated by reference in a renewal. A renewed notice filing becomes effective upon the expiration of the filing being renewed.</p>
                  <p>(c) With respect to a security that is a federal covered security under section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. § 77r(b)(4)(D)), a rule under this act may require a notice filing by or on behalf of an issuer to include a copy of Form D, including the appendix, as promulgated by the securities and exchange commission, and a consent to service of process complying with W.S. 17-4-611 signed by the issuer not later than fifteen (15) days after the first sale of the federal covered security in this state and the payment of a fee as set by rule; and the payment of a fee for any late filing as set by rule.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except with respect to a federal security under section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. § 77r(b)(1)), if the secretary of state finds that there is a failure to comply with a notice or fee requirement of this section, the secretary of state may issue a stop order suspending the offer and sale of a federal covered security in this state. If the deficiency is corrected, the stop order is void as of the time of its issuance and no penalty may be imposed by the secretary of state.</p>

                  <p>(ii) A copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or their substantial equivalents currently in effect; a copy of any agreement with or among underwriters; a copy of any indenture or other instrument governing the issuance of the security to be registered; and a specimen, copy, or description of the security that is required by rule adopted or order issued under this act;</p>

                  <p>(c) A registration statement under this section becomes effective simultaneously with or subsequent to the federal registration statement when all the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

                  <p>(ii) The registration statement has been on file for at least twenty (20) days or a shorter period provided by rule adopted or order issued under this act.</p>
                  <p>(d) The registrant shall promptly notify the secretary of state in a record of the date when the federal registration statement becomes effective and the content of any price amendment and shall promptly file a record containing the price amendment. If the notice is not timely received, the secretary of state may issue a stop order, without prior notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until compliance with this section. The secretary of state shall promptly notify the registrant of an order by telegram, telephone, or electronic means and promptly confirm this notice by a record. If the registrant subsequently complies with the notice requirements of this section, the stop order is void as of the date of its issuance.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the federal registration statement becomes effective before each of the conditions in this section is satisfied or is waived by the secretary of state, the registration statement is automatically effective under this act when all the conditions are satisfied or waived. If the registrant notifies the secretary of state of the date when the federal registration statement is expected to become effective, the secretary of state shall promptly notify the registrant by telegram, telephone, or electronic means and promptly confirm this notice by a record, indicating whether all the conditions are satisfied or waived and whether the secretary of state intends the institution of a proceeding under W.S. 17-4-306. The notice by the secretary of state does not preclude the institution of such a proceeding.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-4-305. Securities registration filings.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A registration statement may be filed by the issuer, a person on whose behalf the offering is to be made, or a broker-dealer registered under this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) A person filing a registration statement shall pay a filing fee of one-fiftieth of one percent (.0002) of the total dollar offering amount to be offered in this state, but the fee shall in no case be less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor more than six hundred dollars ($600.00) when filing an initial registration statement or renewing a previously filed registration statement. If a registration statement is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective stop order is issued under W.S. 17-4-306 the secretary of state shall retain one hundred dollars ($100.00) of the fee.</p>
                  <p>(c) A registration statement filed under W.S. 17-4-303 or 17-4-304 must specify:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount of securities to be offered in this state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The states in which a registration statement or similar record in connection with the offering has been or is to be filed; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any adverse order, judgment, or decree issued in connection with the offering by a state securities regulator, the securities and exchange commission, or a court.</p>
                  <p>(d) A record filed under this act or the predecessor act within five (5) years preceding the filing of a registration statement may be incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent that the record is currently accurate.</p>
                  <p>(e) In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information or a record may not be required under subsection (j) of this section or W.S. 17-4-304, unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the person on whose behalf the distribution is to be made or unless it can be furnished by those persons without unreasonable effort or expense.</p>
                  <p>(f) A rule adopted or order issued under this act may require as a condition of registration that a security issued within the previous five (5) years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially less than the public offering price or to a person for a consideration other than cash be deposited in escrow; and that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere. The conditions of any escrow or impoundment required under this subsection may be established by rule adopted or order issued under this act, but the secretary of state may not reject a depository institution solely because of its location in another state.</p>
                  <p>(g) A rule adopted or order issued under this act may require as a condition of registration that a security registered under this act be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be filed under this act or preserved for a period specified by the rule or order, which may not be longer than five (5) years.</p>
                  <p>(h) Except while a stop order is in effect under W.S. 17-4-306, a registration statement is effective for one (1) year after its effective date, or for any longer period designated in an order under this act during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by an underwriter or broker-dealer that is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken as a participant in the distribution. For the purposes of a nonissuer transaction, all outstanding securities of the same class identified in the registration statement as a security registered under this act are considered to be registered while the registration statement is effective. If any securities of the same class are outstanding, a registration statement may not be withdrawn until one (1) year after its effective date. A registration statement may be withdrawn only with the approval of the secretary of state.</p>
                  <p>(j) While a registration statement is effective, a rule adopted or order issued under this act may require the person that filed the registration statement to file reports, not more often than quarterly, to keep the information or other record in the registration statement reasonably current and to disclose the progress of the offering.</p>
                  <p>(k) A registration statement may be amended after its effective date. The post effective amendment becomes effective when the secretary of state so orders. If a post effective amendment is made to increase the number of securities specified to be offered or sold, the person filing the amendment shall pay a registration fee specified in subsection (b) of this section. A post effective amendment relates back to the date of the offering of the additional securities being registered if, within one (1) year after the date of the sale, the amendment is filed and the additional registration fee is paid.</p>

                  <p>(a) The secretary of state may issue a stop order denying effectiveness to, or suspending or revoking the effectiveness of, a registration statement if the secretary of state finds that the order is in the public interest and that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The registration statement as of its effective date or before the effective date in the case of an order denying effectiveness, an amendment under W.S. 17-4-305(k) as of its effective date, or a report under W.S. 17-4-305(j), is incomplete in a material respect or contains a statement that, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, was false or misleading with respect to a material fact;</p>
                  <p>(ii) This act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act or a condition imposed under this act has been willfully violated, in connection with the offering, by the person filing the registration statement; by the issuer, a partner, officer, or director of the issuer or a person having a similar status or performing a similar function; a promoter of the issuer; or a person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer; but only if the person filing the registration statement is directly or indirectly controlled by or acting for the issuer; or by an underwriter;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The security registered or sought to be registered is the subject of a permanent or temporary injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction or an administrative stop order or similar order issued under any federal, foreign, or state law other than this act applicable to the offering, but the secretary of state may not institute a proceeding against an effective registration statement under this paragraph more than one (1) year after the date of the order or injunction on which it is based, and the secretary of state may not issue an order under this paragraph on the basis of an order or injunction issued under the securities act of another state unless the order or injunction was based on conduct that would constitute, as of the date of the order, a ground for a stop order under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The issuer's enterprise or method of business includes or would include activities that are unlawful where performed;</p>
                  <p>(v) With respect to a security sought to be registered under W.S. 17-4-303, there has been a failure to comply with the undertaking required by W.S. 17-4-303(b)(iv);</p>
                  <p>(vi) The applicant or registrant has not paid the filing fee, but the secretary of state shall void the order if the deficiency is corrected; or</p>
                  <p>(vii) The offering:</p>
                  <p>(A) Will work or tend to work a fraud upon purchasers or would so operate;</p>
                  <p>(B) Has been or would be made with unreasonable amounts of underwriters' and sellers' discounts, commissions, or other compensation, or promoters' profits or participations, or unreasonable amounts or kinds of options; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Is being made on terms that are unfair, unjust, or inequitable.</p>
                  <p>(b) To the extent practicable, the secretary of state by rule adopted or order issued under this act shall publish standards that provide notice of conduct that violates paragraph (a)(vii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The secretary of state may not institute a stop order proceeding against an effective registration statement on the basis of conduct or a transaction known to the secretary of state when the registration statement became effective unless the proceeding is instituted within thirty (30) days after the registration statement became effective.</p>
                  <p>(d) The secretary of state may summarily revoke, deny, postpone, or suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement pending final determination of an administrative proceeding. Upon the issuance of the order, the secretary of state shall promptly notify each person specified in subsection</p>
                  <p>(e) of this section that the order has been issued, the reasons for the revocation, denial, postponement, or suspension, and that within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of a request in a record from the person the matter will be scheduled for a hearing. If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the secretary of state, within thirty (30) days after the date of service of the order, the order becomes final. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the secretary of state, after notice of and opportunity for hearing for each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend the order until final determination.</p>
                  <p>(e) A stop order may not be issued under this section without:</p>
                  <p>(i) Appropriate notice to the applicant or registrant, the issuer, and the person on whose behalf the securities are to be or have been offered;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An opportunity for hearing; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(f) The secretary of state may modify or vacate a stop order issued under this section if the secretary of state finds that the conditions that caused its issuance have changed or that it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>

If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the secretary of state within thirty (30) days after the date of service of the order, the order becomes final by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the secretary of state, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend the order until final determination.</p>
                  <p>(g) An order issued may not be issued under this section, except under subsection (f) of this section, without:</p>

                  <p>(ii) Opportunity for hearing; and</p>

                  <p>(j) The secretary of state may not institute a proceeding under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section based solely on material facts actually known by the secretary of state unless an investigation or the proceeding is instituted within one (1) year after the secretary of state actually acquires knowledge of the material facts.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-4-509. Civil Liability.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Enforcement of civil liability under this section is subject to the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998.</p>
                  <p>(b) A person is liable to the purchaser if the person sells a security in violation of W.S. 17-4-301 or, by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the purchaser not knowing the untruth or omission and the seller not sustaining the burden of proof that the seller did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. An action under this subsection is governed by the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The purchaser may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the security, less the amount of any income received on the security, and interest at six percent (6%) per year from the date of the purchase, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the security, or for actual damages as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The tender referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection may be made any time before entry of judgment.</p>
                  <p>Tender requires only notice in a record of ownership of the security and willingness to exchange the security for the amount specified. A purchaser that no longer owns the security may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it, and interest at six percent (6%) per year from the date of the purchase, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.</p>
                  <p>(c) A person is liable to the seller if the person buys a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the seller not knowing of the untruth or omission, and the purchaser not sustaining the burden of proof that the purchaser did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. An action under this subsection is governed by the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The seller may maintain an action to recover the security, and any income received on the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the purchase price, or for actual damages as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The tender referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of the present ability to pay the amount tendered and willingness to take delivery of the security for the amount specified. If the purchaser no longer owns the security, the seller may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the difference between the price at which the security was sold and the value the security would have had at the time of the sale in the absence of the purchaser's conduct causing liability, and interest at six percent (6%) per year from the date of the sale of the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.</p>
                  <p>(d) A person acting as a broker-dealer or agent that sells or buys a security in violation of W.S. 17-4-401(a), 17-4-402(a), or 17-4-506 is liable to the customer. The customer, if a purchaser, may maintain an action for recovery of actual damages as specified in paragraphs (b)(i) through (iii) of this section, or, if a seller, for a remedy as specified in paragraphs (c)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) A person acting as an investment adviser or investment adviser representative that provides investment advice for compensation in violation of W.S. 17-4-403(a), 17-4-404(a), or 17-4-506 is liable to the client. The client may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice, interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per year from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.</p>
                  <p>(f) A person that receives directly or indirectly any consideration for providing investment advice to another person and that employs a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud the other person or engages in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the other person, is liable to the other person. An action under this subsection is governed by the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person defrauded may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice and the amount of any actual damages caused by the fraudulent conduct, interest at six percent (6%) per year from the date of the fraudulent conduct, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, less the amount of any income received as a result of the fraudulent conduct;</p>
                  <p>(ii) This subsection does not apply to a broker-dealer or its agents if the investment advice provided is solely incidental to transacting business as a broker-dealer and no special compensation is received for the investment advice.</p>
                  <p>(g) The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as persons liable under subsections</p>
                  <p>(b) through (f) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) A person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsections (b) through (f) of this section, unless the controlling person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An individual who is a managing partner, executive officer, or director of a person liable under subsections (b) through (f) of this section, including an individual having a similar status or performing similar functions, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An individual who is an employee of or associated with a person liable under subsections (b) through</p>
                  <p>(f) of this section and who materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) A person that is a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability under subsections (b) through (f) of this section, unless the person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which liability is alleged to exist.</p>
                  <p>(h) A person liable under this section has a right of contribution as in cases of contract against any other person liable under this section for the same conduct.</p>
                  <p>(j) A cause of action under this section survives the death of an individual who might have been a plaintiff or defendant.</p>

                  <p>(i) Under subsection (b) of this section for violation of W.S. 17-4-301, or under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, unless the action is instituted within one (1) year after the violation occurred; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Under subsection (b) of this section, other than for violation of W.S. 17-4-301, or under subsection (c) or (f) of this section, unless the action is instituted within the earlier of two (2) years after discovery of the facts constituting the violation or five (5) years after the violation.</p>
                  <p>(m) A person that has made, or has engaged in the performance of, a contract in violation of this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act, or that has acquired a purported right under the contract with knowledge of conduct by reason of which its making or performance was in violation of this act, may not base an action on the contract.</p>
                  <p>(n) A condition, stipulation, or provision binding a person purchasing or selling a security or receiving investment advice to waive compliance with this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act is void.</p>
                  <p>(o) The rights and remedies provided by this act are in addition to any other rights or remedies that may exist, but this act does not create a cause of action not specified in this section or W.S. 17-4-411(e).</p>

                  <p>(a) The secretary of state may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Conduct public or private investigations within or outside of this state which the secretary of state considers necessary or appropriate to determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act, or to aid in the enforcement of this act or in the adoption of rules and forms under this act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Require or permit a person to testify, file a statement, or produce a record, under oath or otherwise as the secretary of state determines, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning a matter to be investigated or about which an action or proceeding is to be instituted; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Publish a record concerning an action, proceeding, or an investigation under, or a violation of, this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act if the secretary of state determines it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors.</p>
                  <p>(b) For the purpose of an investigation under this act, the secretary of state or his designated officer may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, seek compulsion of attendance, take evidence, require the filing of statements, and require the production of any records that the secretary of state considers relevant or material to the investigation.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a person does not appear or refuses to testify, file a statement, produce records, or otherwise does not obey a subpoena as required by the secretary of state under this act, the secretary of state may refer the matter to the attorney general or district attorney, who may apply to the Wyoming district court or a court of another state to enforce compliance. The court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Hold the person in contempt;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Order the person to appear before the secretary of state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Order the person to testify about the matter under investigation or in question;</p>

                  <p>(v) Grant injunctive relief, including restricting or prohibiting the offer or sale of securities or the providing of investment advice;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Impose a civil penalty of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and not greater than fifty thousand ($50,000.00) for each violation; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Grant any other necessary or appropriate relief.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section does not preclude a person from applying to Wyoming district court or a court of another state for relief from a request to appear, testify, file a statement, produce records, or obey a subpoena.</p>
                  <p>(e) An individual is not excused from attending, testifying, filing a statement, producing a record or other evidence, or obeying a subpoena of the secretary of state under this act or in an action or proceeding instituted by the secretary of state under this act on the ground that the required testimony, statement, record, or other evidence, directly or indirectly, may tend to incriminate the individual or subject the individual to a criminal fine, penalty, or forfeiture. If the individual refuses to testify, file a statement, or produce a record or other evidence on the basis of the individual's privilege against self-incrimination, the secretary of state may apply to the Wyoming district court to compel the testimony, the filing of the statement, the production of the record, or the giving of other evidence. The testimony, record, or other evidence compelled under such an order may not be used, directly or indirectly, against the individual in a criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury or contempt or otherwise failing to comply with the order.</p>
                  <p>(f) At the request of the securities regulator of another state or a foreign jurisdiction, the secretary of state may provide assistance if the requesting regulator states that it is conducting an investigation to determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate a law or rule of the other state or foreign jurisdiction relating to securities matters that the requesting regulator administers or enforces. The secretary of state may provide the assistance by using the authority to investigate and the powers conferred by this section as the secretary of state determines is necessary or appropriate. The assistance may be provided without regard to whether the conduct described in the request would also constitute a violation of this act or other law of this state if occurring in this state. In deciding whether to provide the assistance, the secretary of state may consider whether the requesting regulator is permitted and has agreed to provide assistance reciprocally within its state or foreign jurisdiction to the secretary of state on securities matters when requested; whether compliance with the request would violate or prejudice the public policy of this state; and the availability of resources and employees of the secretary of state to carry out the request for assistance.</p>

If a hearing is requested or ordered, the secretary of state, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a hearing must be held pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. A final order may not be issued unless the secretary of state makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) In a final order under subsection (c) of this section, the secretary of state may impose a civil penalty up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for a single violation or up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for more than one (1) violation.</p>
                  <p>(e) In a final order, the secretary of state may charge the actual cost of an investigation or proceeding for a violation of this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in accordance with W.S. 17-4-609, the secretary of state may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court.</p>
                  <p>(g) If a person does not comply with an order under this section, the secretary of state may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court may not require the secretary of state to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was not in compliance with the order, the court may adjudge the person in civil contempt of the order. The court may impose a further civil penalty against the person for contempt in an amount not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) but not greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for each violation and may grant any other relief the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances.</p>

                  <p>(a) The secretary of state may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Issue forms and orders and, after notice and comment, may adopt and amend rules necessary or appropriate to carry out this act and may repeal rules, including rules and forms governing registration statements, applications, notice filings, reports, and other records;</p>
                  <p>(ii) By rule, define terms, whether or not used in this act, but those definitions may not be inconsistent with this act; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) By rule, classify securities, persons, and transactions and adopt different requirements for different classes.</p>
                  <p>(b) Under this act, a rule or form may not be adopted or amended, or an order issued or amended, unless the secretary of state finds that the rule, form, order, or amendment is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and is consistent with the purposes intended by this act. In adopting, amending, and repealing rules and forms, W.S. 17-4-608 applies in order to achieve uniformity among the states and coordination with federal laws in the form and content of registration statements, applications, reports, and other records, including the adoption of uniform rules, forms, and procedures.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subject to section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act and section 222 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the secretary of state may require that a financial statement filed under this act be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and comply with other requirements specified by rule adopted or order issued under this act. A rule adopted or order issued under this act may establish:</p>
                  <p>(i) Subject to section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act and section 222 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the form and content of financial statements required under this act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether unconsolidated financial statements must be filed; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether required financial statements must be audited by an independent certified public accountant.</p>
                  <p>(d) The secretary of state may provide interpretative opinions or issue determinations that the secretary of state will not institute a proceeding or an action under this act against a specified person for engaging in a specified act, practice, or course of business if the determination is consistent with this act. A rule adopted or order issued under this act may establish a reasonable charge for interpretative opinions or determinations that the secretary of state will not institute an action or a proceeding under this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) A penalty under this act may not be imposed for, and liability does not arise from conduct that is engaged in or omitted in good faith believing it conforms to a rule, form, or order of the secretary of state under this act.</p>
                  <p>(f) A hearing in an administrative proceeding under this act must be conducted in public unless the secretary of state for good cause consistent with this act determines that the hearing will not be so conducted.</p>

A consent appointing the secretary of state the person's agent for service of process in a noncriminal action or proceeding against the person, or the person's successor or personal representative under this act or a rule adopted or order issued under this act after the consent is filed, has the same force and validity as if the service were made personally on the person filing the consent.

                  <p>(ii) The plaintiff files an affidavit of compliance with this subsection in the action or proceeding on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within the time that the court, or the secretary of state in a proceeding before the secretary of state, allows.</p>

                  <p>(a) The predecessor act exclusively governs all actions or proceedings that are pending on the effective date of this act or may be instituted on the basis of conduct occurring before the effective date of this act, but a civil action may not be maintained to enforce any liability under the predecessor act unless instituted within any period of limitation that applied when the cause of action accrued or within five (5) years after the effective date of this act, whichever is earlier.</p>
                  <p>(b) All effective registrations under the predecessor act, all administrative orders relating to the registrations, rules, statements of policy, interpretative opinions, declaratory rulings, no action determinations, and conditions imposed on the registrations under the predecessor act remain in effect while they would have remained in effect if this act had not been enacted. They are considered to have been filed, issued, or imposed under this act, but are exclusively governed by the predecessor act.</p>
                  <p>(c) The predecessor act exclusively applies to an offer or sale made within one (1) year after the effective date of this act pursuant to an offering made in good faith before the effective date of this act on the basis of an exemption available under the predecessor act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to the intent of a donor expressed in a gift instrument, an institution, in managing and investing an institutional fund, shall consider the charitable purposes of the institution and the purposes of the institutional fund.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to complying with the duty of loyalty imposed by law other than this act, each person responsible for managing and investing an institutional fund shall manage and invest the fund in good faith and with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(c) In managing and investing an institutional fund, an institution:</p>
                  <p>(i) May incur only costs that are appropriate and reasonable in relation to the assets, the purposes of the institution and the skills available to the institution; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the management and investment of the fund.</p>
                  <p>(d) An institution may pool two (2) or more institutional funds for purposes of management and investment.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided by a gift instrument, the following rules shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) In managing and investing an institutional fund, the following factors if relevant shall be considered:</p>
                  <p>(A) General economic conditions;</p>
                  <p>(B) The possible effect of inflation or deflation;</p>
                  <p>(C) The expected tax consequences, if any, of investment decisions or strategies;</p>
                  <p>(D) The role that each investment or course of action plays within the overall investment portfolio of the fund;</p>
                  <p>(E) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments;</p>
                  <p>(F) Other resources of the institution;</p>
                  <p>(G) The needs of the institution and the fund to make distributions and to preserve capital; and</p>
                  <p>(H) An asset's special relationship or special value, if any, to the charitable purposes of the institution.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Management and investment decisions about an individual asset shall be made not in isolation but rather in the context of the institutional fund's portfolio of investments as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the fund and to the institution;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Except as otherwise provided by law other than this act, an institution may invest in any kind of property or type of investment consistent with this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) An institution shall diversify the investments of an institutional fund unless the institution reasonably determines that, because of special circumstances, the purposes of the fund are better served without diversification;</p>
                  <p>(v) Within a reasonable time after receiving property, an institution shall make and carry out decisions concerning the retention or disposition of the property or to rebalance a portfolio in order to bring the institutional fund into compliance with the purposes, terms and distribution requirements of the institution as necessary to meet other circumstances of the institution and the requirements of this act;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A person who has special skills or expertise, or is selected in reliance upon the person's representation that the person has special skills or expertise, has a duty to use those skills or that expertise in managing and investing institutional funds.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-7-304. Appropriation for expenditure or accumulation of endowment fund; rules of construction.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to subsection (d) of this section and to the intent of a donor expressed in the gift instrument, an institution may appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as the institution determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes and duration for which the endowment fund is established. Unless stated otherwise in the gift instrument, the assets in an endowment fund are donor- restricted assets until appropriated for expenditure by the institution. In making a determination to appropriate or accumulate, the institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and shall consider, if relevant, the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) The duration and preservation of the endowment fund;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The purposes of the institution and the endowment fund;</p>
                  <p>(iii) General economic conditions;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The possible effect of inflation or deflation;</p>
                  <p>(v) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Other resources of the institution; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) The investment policy of the institution.</p>
                  <p>(b) To limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection (a) of this section, a gift instrument shall specifically state the limitation.</p>
                  <p>(c) Terms in a gift instrument designating a gift as an endowment, or a direction or authorization in the gift instrument to use only "income", "interest", "dividends", or "rents, issues or profits", or "to preserve the principal intact" or words of similar import:</p>
                  <p>(i) Create an endowment fund of permanent duration unless other language in the gift instrument limits the duration or purpose of the fund; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Do not otherwise limit the authority to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) The appropriation for expenditure in any year of an amount greater than seven percent (7%) of the fair market value of an endowment fund, calculated on the basis of market values determined at least quarterly and averaged over a period of not less than three (3) years immediately preceding the year in which the appropriation for expenditure is made, creates a rebuttable presumption of imprudence. For an endowment fund in existence for fewer than three (3) years, the fair market value of the endowment fund shall be calculated for the period the endowment fund has been in existence. This subsection shall not:</p>
                  <p>(i) Apply to an appropriation for expenditure permitted under law other than this act or by the gift instrument; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Create a presumption of prudence for an appropriation for expenditure of an amount less than or equal to seven percent (7%) of the fair market value of the endowment fund.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to any specific limitation set forth in a gift instrument or in law other than this act, an institution may delegate to an external agent the management and investment of an institutional fund to the extent that an institution could prudently delegate under the circumstances. An institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, in:</p>
                  <p>(i) Selecting an agent;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes of the institution and the institutional fund; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Periodically reviewing the agent's actions in order to monitor the agent's performance and compliance with the scope and terms of the delegation.</p>
                  <p>(b) In performing a delegated function, an agent owes a duty to the institution to exercise reasonable care to comply with the scope and terms of the delegation.</p>
                  <p>(c) An institution that complies with subsection (a) of this section is not liable for the decisions or actions of an agent to which the function was delegated.</p>
                  <p>(d) By accepting delegation of a management or investment function from an institution that is subject to the laws of this state, an agent submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state in all proceedings arising from or related to the delegation or the performance of the delegated function.</p>
                  <p>(e) An institution may delegate management and investment functions to its committees, officers or employees as authorized by law of this state other than this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the donor consents in a record, an institution may release or modify, in whole or in part, a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the management, investment or purpose of an institutional fund. A release or modification may not allow a fund to be used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose of the institution.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court upon application of an institution, may modify a restriction contained in a gift instrument regarding the management or investment of an institutional fund if the restriction has become impracticable or wasteful, if it impairs the management or investment of the fund, or if, because of circumstances not anticipated by the donor, a modification of a restriction will further the purposes of the fund. If the institution is a governmental institution as defined by W.S. 17- 7-302(a)(iv), the institution shall notify the attorney general of the application, and the attorney general shall be given an opportunity to be heard. To the extent practicable, any modification shall be made in accordance with the donor's probable intention.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a particular charitable purpose or a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the use of an institutional fund becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, the court, upon application of an institution, may modify the purpose of the fund or the restriction on the use of the fund in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument. If the institution is a governmental institution as defined by W.S. 17-7-302(a)(iv), the institution shall notify the attorney general of the application, and the attorney general shall be given an opportunity to be heard.</p>
                  <p>(d) If an institution determines that a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the management, investment or purposes of an institutional fund is unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, the institution, not less than sixty (60) days after notification to the attorney general, may release or modify the restriction, in whole or part, if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The institutional fund subject to the restriction has a total value of less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00);</p>
                  <p>(ii) More than twenty (20) years have elapsed since the fund was established; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The institution uses the property in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument.</p>

                  <p>(d) The bylaws or the marketing contract, or both, may set a specific sum as liquidated damages to be paid by the patron member or patron to the cooperative for breach of any provision of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of a product and may provide that the member or patron shall pay the costs, premiums for bonds, expenses and fees if an action is brought on the contract by the cooperative. The remedies for breach of contract are valid and enforceable in the courts of this state. The provisions shall be enforced as liquidated damages and are not to be considered or regarded as a penalty.</p>
                  <p>(e) If there is a breach or threatened breach of a marketing contract by a patron member or patron, the cooperative is entitled to an injunction to prevent the further breach of the contract and to a decree of specific performance of the contract. Pending the adjudication of the action after filing a certified complaint showing the breach or threatened breach and filing a sufficient bond, the cooperative is entitled to a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the patron member or patron.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any person who knowingly induces or attempts to induce any member or patrons of a cooperative organized under this article to breach his marketing contract with the cooperative, or who maliciously and knowingly spreads false reports about the finances or management thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), for each such offense; provided, that this section shall not apply to a bona fide creditor of such cooperative, or the agent or attorney of any such bona fide creditor, endeavoring to make collections of the indebtedness.</p>
                  <p>(g) In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (f) of this section, the person, corporation or other entity may be liable to the cooperative for civil damages for any violation of the provisions of subsection (f) of this section. Each violation shall constitute a separate offense and is subject to the penalties in this subsection and subsection (f) of this section.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-10-222. Membership interests.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The authorized amount and divisions of patron membership interests and nonpatron membership interests may be increased or decreased or established or altered, in accordance with the restrictions in this article by amending the articles at a regular members' meeting or at a special members' meeting called for the purpose of the amendment.</p>
                  <p>(b) Authorized membership interests may be issued on terms and conditions prescribed in the articles, bylaws, or as determined by the board. The cooperative shall disclose to any person or entity acquiring membership interests to be issued by the cooperative, the organization, capital structure and business prospects and risks of the cooperative, the nature of the governance and financial rights of the membership interest being acquired and of other classes of membership and membership interests. The cooperative shall notify all members of the membership interests being offered by the cooperative. A membership interest may not be issued until the subscription price of the membership interest has been paid for in cash or a cash equivalent or property with the agreed upon value of the property to be contributed.</p>
                  <p>(c) The patron membership interests collectively shall have not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the cooperative's financial rights to profit allocations and distributions.</p>
                  <p>(d) After issuance by the cooperative, membership interests in a cooperative may only be sold or transferred with the approval of the board.</p>
                  <p>(e) The cooperative may solicit and issue nonpatron membership interests on terms and conditions determined by the board and disclosed in the articles, bylaws or by separate disclosure to the members. Each member acquiring nonpatron membership interests shall sign a member control agreement which shall describe the rights and obligations of the member as it relates to the nonpatron membership interests, the financial and governance rights, the transferability of the nonpatron membership interests, the division and allocations of profits and losses among the membership interests and membership classes, and financial rights upon liquidation. If the bylaws do not otherwise provide for the allocation of the profits and losses between patron membership interests and nonpatron membership interests, then the allocation of profits and losses among nonpatron membership interests individually and patron membership interests collectively shall be allocated on the basis of the value of contributions to capital made according to the patron membership interests collectively and the nonpatron membership interests individually to the extent the contributions have been accepted by the cooperative. Distributions of cash or other assets of the cooperative shall be allocated among the membership interests as provided in the articles and bylaws, subject to the provisions of this article. If not otherwise provided, distributions shall be made on the basis of value of the capital contributions of the patron membership interests collectively and the nonpatron membership interests to the extent the contributions have been accepted by the cooperative.</p>
                  <p>(f) The bylaws may provide that the cooperative or the patron members, individually or collectively, have the first privilege of purchasing the membership interests of any class of patron member's membership interests offered for sale. The first privilege to purchase patron membership interests may be satisfied by notice to other patron members that the patron membership interests are for sale and a procedure by which patron members may proceed to attempt to purchase and acquire the patron membership interests. A patron membership interest acquired by the cooperative may be held to be reissued or may be retired and cancelled.</p>
                  <p>(g) Subject to the provisions in the bylaws, a member may dissent from and obtain payment for the fair value of the member's nonpatron membership interests in the cooperative if the articles or bylaws are amended in a manner that materially and adversely affects the rights and preferences of the nonpatron membership interests of the dissenting member. The dissenting member shall file a notice of intent to demand fair value of the membership interest with the records officer of the cooperative within thirty (30) days after the amendment of the bylaws and notice of the amendment to members, otherwise the right of the dissenting member to demand payment of fair value for the membership interest is deemed to be waived. If a proposed amendment of the articles or bylaws shall be approved by the members, a member who is entitled to dissent and who wishes to exercise dissenter's rights shall file a notice to demand fair value of the membership interest with the records officer of the cooperative before the vote on the proposed action and shall not vote in favor of the proposed action, otherwise the right to demand fair value for the membership interest by the dissenting member is deemed waived. After receipt of the dissenting member's demand notice and approval of the amendment, the cooperative has sixty (60) days to rescind the amendment or otherwise the cooperative shall remit the fair value for the one (1) member's interest to the dissenting member by one hundred eighty (180) days after receipt of the notice. Upon receipt of the fair value for the membership interest, the member has no further member rights in the cooperative.</p>

                  <p>(b) The cooperative shall refund to the member for the surrendered financial rights of membership interest the lesser of the book value or market value of the financial right of the membership interest payable in not more than seven (7) years from the date of surrender or the board may transfer all of any patron member's financial rights to a class of financial rights held by members who are not patron members, or to a certificate of interest which carries liquidation rights on par with membership interests and is redeemed within seven (7) years after the transfer as provided in the certificate.</p>
                  <p>(c) Membership interests required to be surrendered may be reissued or be retired and cancelled by the board.</p>

                  <p>(e) A member is not, merely on the account of that status, personally liable for the acts, debts, liabilities, or obligations of a cooperative. A member is liable for any unpaid subscription for the membership interest, unpaid membership fees, or a debt for which the member has separately contracted with the cooperative.</p>

                  <p>(a) A court may grant equitable relief that it deems just and reasonable in the circumstances or may dissolve a cooperative and liquidate its assets and business in any of the following circumstances:</p>
                  <p>(i) In a supervised voluntary dissolution that is applied for by the cooperative;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In an action by a member when it is established that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The directors or the persons having the authority otherwise vested in the board are deadlocked in the management of the cooperative's affairs and the members are unable to break the deadlock;</p>
                  <p>(B) The directors or those in control of the cooperative have acted fraudulently, illegally or in a manner unfairly prejudicial toward one (1) or more members in their capacities as members, directors or officers;</p>
                  <p>(C) The members of the cooperative are so divided in voting power that, for a period that includes the time when two (2) consecutive regular members' meetings were held, they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon the election and qualification of their successors;</p>
                  <p>(D) The cooperative assets are being misapplied or wasted; or</p>
                  <p>(E) The period of duration as provided in the articles has expired and has not been extended as provided in this article.</p>
                  <p>(iii) In an action by a creditor when:</p>
                  <p>(A) The claim of the creditor against the cooperative has been reduced to judgment and an execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The cooperative has admitted in writing that the claim of the creditor against the cooperative is due and owing and it is established that the cooperative is unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business.</p>
                  <p>(iv) In an action by the attorney general to dissolve the cooperative in accordance with this article when it is established that a decree of dissolution is appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining whether to order equitable relief or dissolution, the court shall take into consideration the financial condition of the cooperative but may not refuse to order equitable relief or dissolution solely on the ground that the cooperative has accumulated operating net income or current operating net income.</p>
                  <p>(c) In deciding whether to order dissolution of the cooperative, the court shall consider whether lesser relief suggested by one (1) or more parties, such as a form of equitable relief or a partial liquidation, would be adequate to permanently relieve the circumstances established under subparagraph (a)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section. Lesser relief may be ordered if it would be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the court finds that a party to a proceeding brought under this section has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or otherwise not in good faith, the court may in its discretion award reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, to any of the other parties.</p>
                  <p>(e) Proceedings under this section shall be brought in a court within the county where the registered address of the cooperative is located.</p>
                  <p>(f) It is not necessary to make members parties to the action or proceeding unless relief is sought against them personally.</p>

                  <p>(v) Other claims proved and allowed.</p>
                  <p>(d) After payment of the expenses of receivership and claims of creditors are proved, the remaining assets, if any, may be distributed to the members or distributed pursuant to an approved liquidation plan.</p>

                  <p>(b) An action may not be commenced under subsection (a) of this section until thirty (30) days after notice to the cooperative by the attorney general of the reason for the filing of the action. If the reason for filing the action is an act that the cooperative has done, or omitted to do, and the act or omission may be corrected by an amendment of the articles or bylaws or by performance of or abstention from the act, the attorney general shall give the cooperative thirty (30) additional days to make the correction before filing the action.</p>
                  <p>(c) The provisions of W.S. 17-16-1420 through 17-16-1423 shall apply to the administrative dissolution of any domestic cooperative and the provisions of W.S. 17-16-1530 through 17-16-1532 shall apply to the administrative dissolution of any foreign cooperative.</p>

                  <p>(c) The enumeration in subsection (b) of this section does not mean that the possession or exercise of any other powers by a limited partner constitutes participation by him in the business of the limited partnership.</p>
                  <p>(d) A limited partner who knowingly permits his name to be used in the name of the limited partnership, except under circumstances permitted by W.S. 17-14-203(a)(ii)(A), is liable to creditors who extend credit to the limited partnership without actual knowledge that the limited partner is not a general partner.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in this act, in subsections (b) and</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section or in the partnership agreement, a general partner of a limited partnership has the rights and powers and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities of a partner in a partnership without limited partners.</p>
                  <p>(b) A person that becomes a general partner of an existing limited partnership is not personally liable for an obligation of a limited partnership incurred before the person became a partner.</p>
                  <p>(c) An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner of a limited liability limited partnership. This subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the election by all the partners to become a limited liability limited partnership. For purposes of this section, the obligation of a limited partnership under contract is deemed to arise at the time the limited partnership entered into the contract.</p>

If a partner does not make the required contribution of property or services, he is obligated at the option of the limited partnership to contribute cash equal to that portion of the value (as stated in the partnership records required to be kept pursuant to W.S. 17-14-206) of the stated contribution that has not been made.</p>

Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited partnership who extends credit, or otherwise acts in reliance on that obligation after the partner signs a writing which reflects the obligation, and before the amendment or cancellation thereof to reflect the compromise, may enforce the original obligation.</p>

                  <p>(a) A limited partner may withdraw from a limited partnership at the time or upon the happening of events specified in writing in the partnership agreement. If the agreement does not specify in writing the time or the events upon the happening of which a limited partner may withdraw or a definite time for the dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership, a limited partner may withdraw upon not less than six (6) months prior written notice to each general partner at his address on the books of the limited partnership at its office in this state.

                  <p>(a) The articles of incorporation shall set forth the classes of shares and series of shares within a class, and the number, which may be unlimited, of shares of each class and series that the corporation is authorized to issue. If more than one (1) class or series of shares is authorized, the articles of incorporation shall prescribe a distinguishing designation for each class or series, and shall prescribe, prior to the issuance of shares of a class or series, the terms, including preferences, rights and limitations of that class or series. Except to the extent varied as permitted by this section, all shares of a class or series shall have terms, including preferences, rights and limitations that are identical with those of other shares of the same class or series.</p>
                  <p>(b) The articles of incorporation shall authorize:</p>
                  <p>(i) One (1) or more classes or series of shares that together have unlimited voting rights; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) One (1) or more classes or series of shares, which may be the same class or classes as those with voting rights, that together are entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution.</p>
                  <p>(c) The articles of incorporation may authorize one (1) or more classes or series of shares that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Have special, conditional, or limited voting rights, or no right to vote, except to the extent otherwise provided by this act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Are redeemable or convertible as specified in the articles of incorporation:</p>
                  <p>(A) At the option of the corporation, the shareholder, or another person or upon the occurrence of a specified event;</p>
                  <p>(B) For cash, indebtedness, securities, or other property; and</p>
                  <p>(C) At prices and in amounts specified or determined in accordance with a formula.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Entitle the holders to distributions calculated in any manner, including dividends that may be cumulative, noncumulative, or partially cumulative; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Have preference over any other class or series of shares with respect to distributions, including distributions upon the dissolution of the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(d) Terms of shares may be made dependent upon facts objectively ascertainable outside the articles of incorporation.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any of the terms of shares may vary among holders of the same class or series so long as such variations are expressly set forth in the articles of incorporation.</p>

                  <p>(a) A corporation may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Issue fractions of a share or pay in money the value of fractions of a share;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Arrange for disposition of fractional shares by the shareholders; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Issue scrip in registered or bearer form entitling the holder to receive a full share upon surrendering enough scrip to equal a full share.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each certificate representing scrip shall be conspicuously labeled "scrip" and shall contain the information required by W.S. 17-16-625(b).</p>
                  <p>(c) The holder of a fractional share is entitled to exercise the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote, to receive dividends, and to participate in the assets of the corporation upon liquidation. The holder of scrip is not entitled to any of these rights unless the scrip provides for them.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board of directors may authorize the issuance of scrip subject to any condition considered desirable, including:</p>
                  <p>(i) That the scrip will become void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) That the shares for which the scrip is exchangeable may be sold and the proceeds paid to the scripholders.</p>

                  <p>(b) The board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscriptions for shares that were entered into before incorporation, unless the subscription agreement specifies them. A call for payment by the board of directors shall be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.</p>
                  <p>(c) Shares issued pursuant to subscriptions entered into before incorporation are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration specified in the subscription agreement.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a subscriber defaults in payment of money or property under a subscription agreement entered into before incorporation, the corporation may collect the amount owed as any other debt. Alternatively, unless the subscription agreement provides otherwise, the corporation may rescind the agreement and may sell the shares if the debt remains unpaid more than twenty (20) days after the corporation sends written demand for payment to the subscriber.</p>
                  <p>(e) A subscription agreement entered into after incorporation is a contract between the subscriber and the corporation subject to W.S. 17-16-621.</p>

                  <p>(a) The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(c) Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors shall determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.</p>
                  <p>(d) When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable.</p>
                  <p>(e) The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note is paid, or the benefits received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid, or the benefits are not received, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited may be cancelled in whole or part.</p>
                  <p>(f)(i) An issuance of shares or other securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares, in a transaction or a series of integrated transactions, requires approval of the shareholders, at a meeting at which a quorum exists, if:</p>
                  <p>(A) The shares, other securities, or rights are issued for consideration other than cash or cash equivalents; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The voting power of shares that are issued and issuable as a result of the transaction or series of integrated transactions will comprise more than twenty percent (20%) of the voting power of the shares of the corporation that were outstanding immediately before the transaction.</p>
                  <p>(ii) In this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(A) For purposes of determining the voting power of shares issued and issuable as a result of a transaction or series of integrated transactions, the voting power of shares shall be the greater of:</p>
                  <p>(I) The voting power of the shares to be issued; or</p>
                  <p>(II) The voting power of the shares that would be outstanding after giving effect to the conversion of convertible shares and other securities and the exercise of rights to be issued.</p>
                  <p>(B) A series of transactions is integrated if consummation of one (1) transaction is made contingent on consummation of one (1) or more of the other transactions.</p>

An issuance of shares under this subsection is a share dividend.</p>
                  <p>(b) Shares of one (1) class or series may not be issued as a share dividend in respect of shares of another class or series unless:</p>

The authorization by the board of directors for the corporation to issue the rights, options or warrants constitutes authorization of the issuance of the shares or other securities for which the rights, options or warrants are exercisable.</p>
                  <p>(b) The terms and conditions of such rights, options or warrants, including those outstanding on July 1, 2009, may include, without limitation, restrictions or conditions that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Preclude or limit the exercise, transfer or receipt of such rights, options or warrants by any person owning or offering to acquire a specified number or percentage of the outstanding shares or other securities of the corporation or by any transferee of any such person; or</p>

                  <p>(a) Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Unless this act or another statute expressly provides otherwise, the rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates.</p>
                  <p>(b) At a minimum each share certificate shall state on its face:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name of the issuing corporation and that it is organized under the law of this state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The name of the person to whom, or in the case of a certificate token, the data address to which the token was issued; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, the certificate represents.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the issuing corporation is authorized to issue different classes of shares or different series within a class, the designations, relative rights, preferences, and limitations applicable to each class and the variations in rights, preferences, and limitations determined for each series, and the authority of the board of directors to determine variations for future series, shall be summarized on the front or back of each certificate. Alternatively, each certificate may state conspicuously on its front or back that the corporation will furnish the shareholder this information on request in writing and without charge.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided by subsection (g) of this section, each share certificate:</p>
                  <p>(i) Shall be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by two (2) officers designated in the bylaws or by the board of directors; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) May bear the corporate seal or its facsimile.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the person who signed a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate is nevertheless valid.</p>
                  <p>(f) In no case shall a corporation issue share certificates in bearer form. For purposes of this subsection "bearer form" means a form in which the certificate is payable to the bearer of the certificate according to its terms but not by reason of an endorsement. If a corporation formed under this act or qualified to do business under this act has bearer shares outstanding, the entity shall conform those shares to comply with this section on or before October 1, 2007.

                  <p>(a) The articles of incorporation, bylaws, an agreement among shareholders, or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.</p>
                  <p>(b) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by W.S. 17-16-626(b). Unless so noted or contained, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.</p>
                  <p>(c) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is authorized:</p>
                  <p>(i) To maintain the corporation's status when it is dependent on the number or identity of its shareholders;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To preserve exemptions under federal or state securities law; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) For any other reasonable purpose.</p>
                  <p>(d) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Obligate the shareholder first to offer the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively, or simultaneously, an opportunity to acquire the restricted shares;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Obligate the corporation or other persons, separately, consecutively, or simultaneously, to acquire the restricted shares;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Require the corporation, the holders of any class of its shares, or another person to approve the transfer of the restricted shares, if the requirement is not manifestly unreasonable; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Prohibit the transfer of the restricted shares to designated persons or classes of persons, if the prohibition is not manifestly unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>(e) For purposes of this section, "shares" includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.</p>

                  <p>(a) The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation so provide.</p>
                  <p>(b) A statement included in the articles of incorporation that "the corporation elects to have preemptive rights," or words of similar import, means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:</p>
                  <p>(i) The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A shareholder may waive his preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration;</p>
                  <p>(iii) There is no preemptive right with respect to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;</p>
                  <p>(B) Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;</p>
                  <p>(C) Shares authorized in articles of incorporation that are issued within six (6) months from the effective date of incorporation; or</p>
                  <p>(D) Shares sold otherwise than for money.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class;</p>
                  <p>(v) Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one (1) year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one (1) year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of this section, "shares" includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-16-640. Distributions to shareholders.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one (1) involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.</p>
                  <p>(c) No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:</p>
                  <p>(i) The corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (c) of this section either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, the effect of a distribution under subsection (c) of this section is measured:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of:</p>
                  <p>(A) The date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares.</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) In all other cases, as of:</p>
                  <p>(A) The date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of authorization; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of authorization.</p>
                  <p>(f) A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.</p>
                  <p>(g) Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (c) of this section if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.</p>
                  <p>(h) This section shall not apply to distributions in liquidation under article 14 of this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by W.S. 17-16-704, a corporation shall hold a meeting of shareholders annually at a time stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>
                  <p>(b) Annual shareholders' meetings may be held in or out of this state at the place stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. If no place is stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws, annual meetings shall be held at the corporation's principal office. The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held by means of remote communication. The board shall take into consideration stockholders' ability to participate by remote communication and provide an alternative means of participation for those stockholders unable to participate by remote communication. If authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to guidelines and procedures the board of directors may adopt, stockholders and proxies not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication:</p>
                  <p>(i) Participate in a meeting of stockholders; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether the meeting is held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy. The corporations shall implement reasonable measures to provide the stockholders and proxies a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with the proceeding. If any stockholder or proxy votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of the vote or other action shall be maintained by the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(c) The failure to hold an annual meeting at the time stated in or fixed in accordance with a corporation's bylaws does not affect the validity of any corporate action.</p>

                  <p>(ii) If the holders of at least ten percent (10%) of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date, and deliver to the corporation one (1) or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held, provided that the articles of incorporation may fix a lower percentage or a higher percentage not exceeding twenty- five percent (25%) of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a written demand for a special meeting may be revoked by a writing to that effect received by the corporation prior to the receipt by the corporation of demands sufficient in number to require the holding of a special meeting.</p>
                  <p>(b) If not otherwise fixed under W.S. 17-16-703 or 17-16-707, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to demand a special meeting is the date the first shareholder signs the demand.</p>

                  <p>(a) Action required or permitted by this act to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action shall be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents bearing the date of signature and describing the action taken, signed by the holders of the requisite number of shares entitled to vote on the action, and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.</p>
                  <p>(b) The articles of incorporation may provide that any action required or permitted by this act to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting, and without prior notice, if consents in writing setting forth the action so taken are signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. The written consent shall bear the date of signature of the shareholder who signs the consent and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.</p>
                  <p>(c) If not otherwise fixed under W.S. 17-16-703 or 17-16-707, and if prior board action is not required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent is delivered to the corporation. If not otherwise fixed under W.S. 17-16-707 and if prior board action is required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date shall be the close of business on the day the resolution of the board taking such prior action is adopted. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest date on which a consent delivered to the corporation as required by this section was signed, written consents signed by sufficient shareholders to take the action have been delivered to the corporation. A written consent may be revoked by a writing to that effect delivered to the corporation before unrevoked written consents sufficient in number to take corporate action are delivered to the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(d) A consent signed pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect of a vote taken at a meeting and may be described as such in any document. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors provides for a reasonable delay to permit tabulation of written consents, the action taken by written consent shall be effective when written consents signed by sufficient shareholders to take the action are delivered to the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(e) If this act requires that notice of proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the action not more than ten (10) days after written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation or the later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to the authorization under subsection (d) of this section. The notice shall reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision of this act, would have been required to be sent to nonvoting shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.</p>
                  <p>(f) If action is taken by less than unanimous written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonconsenting voting shareholders written notice of the action not more than ten (10) days after written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation, or the later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection (d) of this section. The notice shall reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision of this act, would have been required to be sent to voting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.</p>
                  <p>(g) The notice requirements in subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall not delay the effectiveness of actions taken by written consent, and a failure to comply with such notice requirements shall not invalidate actions taken by written consent, provided that this subsection shall not be deemed to limit judicial power to fashion any appropriate remedy in favor of a shareholder adversely affected by a failure to give the notice within the required time period.</p>
                  <p>(h) An electronic transmission may be used to consent to an action, if the electronic transmission contains or is accompanied by information from which the corporation can determine the date on which the electronic transmission was signed and that the electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder, the shareholder's agent or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact.</p>
                  <p>(i) Delivery of a written consent to the corporation under this section is delivery to the corporation's registered agent at its registered office or to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office.</p>

                  <p>(a) After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical or numerical list of the identities of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the number of shares held by each shareholder. The list shall also show each shareholder's physical mailing address, if the identity of a shareholder on the list consists of the shareholder's name, and each shareholder's authorized means of receipt for electronic transmissions, if the identity of a shareholder on the list consists of the shareholder's data address.</p>
                  <p>(b) The shareholders' list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two (2) business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder, his agent, or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of W.S. 17-16-1602(c), to copy the list, during regular business hours and at the shareholder's expense, during the period it is available for inspection.</p>
                  <p>(c) The corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the meeting, and any shareholder, his agent, or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, his agent, or attorney to inspect the shareholders' list before or at the meeting, or to copy the list as permitted by subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section, the district court of the county where a corporation's principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense, order payment by the corporation of the shareholder's cost of suit including reasonable attorney fees and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.</p>
                  <p>(e) Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders' list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.</p>

Only shares are entitled to vote.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless authorized by a district court, the shares of a corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned, directly or indirectly, by a second corporation, domestic or foreign, and the first corporation owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the shares entitled to vote for directors of the second corporation.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not limit the power of a corporation to vote any shares, including its own shares, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.</p>
                  <p>(d) Redeemable shares are not entitled to vote after notice of redemption is mailed to the holders and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company, or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price on surrender of the shares.</p>

                  <p>(a) A shareholder may vote his shares in person or by proxy.</p>
                  <p>(b) A shareholder or his agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form or by an electronic transmission. An electronic transmission shall contain or be accompanied by information from which one can determine that the shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact authorized the electronic transmission.</p>
                  <p>(c) An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form.</p>
                  <p>(d) An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include the appointment of:</p>
                  <p>(i) A pledgee;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares;</p>

                  <p>(iv) An employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or</p>
                  <p>(v) A party to a voting agreement created under W.S. 17-16-731.</p>
                  <p>(e) The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises his authority under the appointment.</p>
                  <p>(f) An appointment made irrevocable under subsection (d) of this section is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished.</p>
                  <p>(g) A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if he did not know of its existence when he acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates.</p>
                  <p>(h) Subject to W.S. 17-16-724 and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority stated in the appointment form or electronic transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.</p>

                  <p>(c) If a quorum exists, action on a matter other than the election of directors by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles of incorporation or this act require a greater number of affirmative votes.</p>

                  <p>(a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.</p>
                  <p>(b) Shareholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for directors unless the articles of incorporation so provide.</p>
                  <p>(c) A statement included in the articles of incorporation that "[all] [a designated voting group of] shareholders are entitled to cumulate their votes for directors," or words of similar import, means that the shareholders designated are entitled to multiply the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two (2) or more candidates.</p>
                  <p>(d) Shares otherwise entitled to vote cumulatively may not be voted cumulatively at a particular meeting unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The meeting notice or proxy statement accompanying the notice states conspicuously that cumulative voting is authorized; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) A shareholder who has the right to cumulate his votes gives notice to the corporation not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time set for the meeting of the shareholder's intent to cumulate his votes during the meeting. If one (1) shareholder gives this notice all other shareholders in the same voting group participating in the election are entitled to cumulate their votes without giving further notice.</p>

The list shall also show each shareholder's physical mailing address, if the identity of a shareholder on the list consists of the shareholder's name, and each shareholder's authorized means of receipt for electronic transmissions, if the identity of a shareholder on the list consists of the shareholder's data address. Copies of the list and agreement shall be delivered to the corporation's principal office.</p>
                  <p>(b) A voting trust becomes effective on the date the first shares subject to the trust are registered in the trustee's name. A voting trust is valid for not more than ten (10) years after its effective date unless extended under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

The voting trustee shall deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of beneficial owners to the corporation's principal office. An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it.</p>

                  <p>(a) An agreement among the shareholders of a corporation that complies with this section is effective among the shareholders and the corporation even though it is inconsistent with one (1) or more other provisions of this act in that it:</p>
                  <p>(i) Eliminates the board of directors or restricts the discretion or powers of the board of directors;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Governs the authorization or making of distributions whether or not in proportion to ownership of shares, subject to the limitations in W.S. 17-16-640;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Establishes who shall be directors or officers of the corporation, or their terms of office or manner of selection or removal;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Governs, in general or in regard to specific matters, the exercise or division of voting power by or between the shareholders and directors or by or among any of them, including use of weighted voting rights or director proxies;</p>
                  <p>(v) Establishes the terms and conditions of any agreement for the transfer or use of property or the provision of services between the corporation and any shareholder, director, officer or employee of the corporation or among any of them;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Transfers to one (1) or more shareholders or other persons all or part of the authority to exercise the corporate powers or to manage the business and affairs of the corporation, including the resolution of any issue about which there exists a deadlock among directors or shareholders;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Requires dissolution of the corporation at the request of one (1) or more of the shareholders or upon the occurrence of a specified event or contingency; or</p>
                  <p>(viii) Otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the shareholders, the directors and the corporation, or among any of them, and is not contrary to public policy.</p>
                  <p>(b) An agreement authorized by this section shall be:</p>
                  <p>(i) Set forth:</p>
                  <p>(A) In the articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement; or</p>
                  <p>(B) In a written agreement that is signed by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement and which agreement is made known to the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subject to amendment only by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Valid for ten (10) years, unless the agreement provides otherwise. Nothing herein affects agreements in force on July 1, 1997.</p>
                  <p>(c) The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement required by W.S. 17-16-626(b). If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Any purchaser of shares who, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement shall be entitled to rescission of the purchase. A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares. An action to enforce the right of rescission authorized by this subsection must be commenced within the earlier of ninety (90) days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or two (2) years after the time of purchase of the shares.</p>
                  <p>(d) An agreement authorized by this section shall cease to be effective when the corporation becomes a public corporation. If the agreement ceases to be effective for any reason, the board of directors may, if the agreement is contained or referred to in the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws, adopt an amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws, without shareholder action, to delete the agreement and any references to it.</p>
                  <p>(e) An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement.</p>
                  <p>(f) The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.</p>
                  <p>(g) Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made.</p>

                  <p>(i) Provided in W.S. 17-16-1022 if a bylaw electing to be governed by that section is in effect; or</p>

                  <p>The articles of incorporation may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two (2) or three (3) groups, with each group containing one-half (1/2) or one-third (1/3) of the total, as near as may be practicable. In that event, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders' meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second annual shareholders' meeting after their election, and the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders' meeting after their election. At each annual shareholders' meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a term of two (2) years or three (3) years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.</p>

                  <p>(b) A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events.

                  <p>(a) The district court of the county where a corporation's principal office, or if none in this state, its registered office, is located may remove a director of the corporation from office in a proceeding commenced by or in the right of the corporation if the court finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The director engaged in fraudulent conduct with respect to the corporation or its shareholders, grossly abused the position of director, or intentionally inflicted harm on the corporation; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Considering the director's course of conduct and the inadequacy of other available remedies, removal would be in the best interest of the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(b) A shareholder proceeding on behalf of the corporation under subsection (a) of this section shall comply with all of the requirements of W.S. 17-16-740 through 17-16-747 excluding W.S. 17-16-741(a)(i).</p>

The action shall be evidenced by one (1) or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by the requisite number of directors, or shall be sent by electronic transmission by the requisite number of directors, and shall be included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.</p>
                  <p>(b) Action taken under this section is the act of the board of directors when one (1) or more consents signed by the requisite number of directors are delivered to the corporation. The consent may specify the time at which the action taken thereunder is to be effective. A director's consent may be withdrawn by a revocation signed by the director and delivered to the corporation prior to delivery to the corporation of unrevoked written consents signed by the requisite number of directors. If action is taken by less than unanimous written consent of the directors, the corporation shall give the nonconsenting or nonvoting directors written notice of the action not more than ten (10) days after written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation. The notice shall reasonably describe the action taken. The requirement to give the notice shall not delay the effectiveness of actions taken by the written consent, and a failure to comply with the notice requirements shall not invalidate actions taken by written consent, provided that this subsection shall not be deemed to limit judicial power to fashion any appropriate remedy in favor of a director adversely affected by a failure to give the notice within the required time period.</p>
                  <p>(c) A consent signed under this section has the effect of action taken at a meeting of the board of directors and may be described as such in any document.</p>

                  <p>(a) An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to the corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective time. If a resignation is made effective at a later time and the board or appointing officer accepts the future effective time, the board or appointing officer may fill the pending vacancy before the effective time if the board or appointing officer provides that the successor does not take office until the effective time.</p>
                  <p>(b) An officer may be removed at any time with or without cause by:</p>
                  <p>(i) The board of directors;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The officer who appointed such officer, unless the bylaws or the board of directors provide otherwise; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any other officer if authorized by the bylaws or the board of directors.</p>
                  <p>(c) In this section, "appointing officer" means the officer, including any successor to that officer, who appointed the officer resigning or being removed.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a corporation may indemnify an individual who is a party to a proceeding because the individual is a director against liability incurred in the proceeding if:</p>
                  <p>(i)(A) The director conducted himself in good faith; and</p>
                  <p>(B) He reasonably believed that his conduct was in or at least not opposed to the corporation's best interests; and</p>
                  <p>(C) In the case of any criminal proceeding, the director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful; or</p>

                  <p>(c) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director did not meet the standard of conduct described in this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Unless ordered by a court under W.S. 17-16-854(a)(iii) a corporation may not indemnify a director under this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) In connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation, except for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding if it is determined that the director has met the standard of conduct under subsection (a) of this section; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In connection with any proceeding with respect to conduct for which he was adjudged liable on the basis that he received a financial benefit to which he was not entitled, whether or not involving action in the director's capacity.</p>

                  <p>(i) A written affirmation of his good faith belief that the standard of conduct described in W.S. 17-16-851 has been met by the director or that the proceeding involves conduct for which liability has been eliminated under a provision of the articles of incorporation as authorized by W.S. 17-16-202(b)(iv); and</p>
                  <p>(ii) His written undertaking to repay any funds advanced if the director is not entitled to mandatory indemnification under W.S. 17-16-852 and it is ultimately determined under W.S. 17-16-854 or 17-16-855 that he has not met the standard of conduct described in W.S. 17-16-851.</p>

                  <p>(a) A director who is a party to a proceeding because he is a director may apply for indemnification or an advance for expenses to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. After receipt of an application and after giving any notice it considers necessary, the court shall:</p>

                  <p>(A) To indemnify the director; or</p>
                  <p>(B) To advance expenses to the director, even if he has not met the standard of conduct set forth in W.S. 17-16-851(a), failed to comply with W.S. 17-16-853 or was adjudged liable in a proceeding referred to in W.S. 17-16-851(d)(i) or (ii), but if the director was adjudged so liable his indemnification shall be limited to expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification under paragraph (a)(i) of this section or to indemnification or advance for expenses under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, it shall also order the corporation to pay the director's expenses incurred in connection with obtaining court-ordered indemnification or advance for expenses.

                  <p>(i) The qualified directors have deliberated and voted outside the presence of and without the participation by any other director; and</p>

                  <p>(B) The members of the committee were appointed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified directors on the board.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, when a transaction is a director's conflicting interest transaction only because a related person described in W.S. 17-16-860(a)(v)(E) or (F) is a party to or has a material financial interest in the transaction, the conflicted director is not obligated to make required disclosure to the extent that the director reasonably believes that doing so would violate a duty imposed under law, a legally enforceable obligation of confidentiality, or a professional ethics rule, provided that the conflicted director discloses to the qualified directors voting on the transaction:</p>
                  <p>(i) All information required to be disclosed that is not so violative;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The existence and nature of the director's conflicting interest; and</p>

                  <p>(i) Notice to shareholders describing the action to be taken respecting the transaction;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provision to the corporation of the information referred to in subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Communication to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction of the information that is the subject of required disclosure, or modified disclosure as described in W.S. 17-16-862(b) if the director's conflicting interest transaction is of the type described in that subsection, to the extent the information is not known by them.</p>
                  <p>(b) A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction shall, before the shareholders' vote, inform the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, in writing, of the number of shares that the director knows are not qualified shares under subsection (c) of this section and the identity of the holders of those shares.</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Holder" means and "held by" refers to shares held by both a record shareholder, as defined in W.S. 17-16-1301(a)(vi), and a beneficial shareholder as defined in W.S. 17-16-1301(a)(i);</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Qualified shares" means all shares entitled to be voted with respect to the transaction except for shares that the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes either knows, or under subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section is notified, are held by:</p>
                  <p>(A) A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction; or</p>
                  <p>(B) A related person of the director, excluding a person described in W.S. 17-16-860(a)(v)(F).</p>
                  <p>(d) A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of compliance with this section. Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, shareholders' action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence of holders, or by the voting, of shares that are not qualified shares.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a shareholders' vote does not comply with subsection (a) of this section solely because of a director's failure to comply with subsection (b) of this section, and if the director establishes that the failure was not intended to influence and did not in fact determine the outcome of the vote, the court may give the effect, if any, to the shareholders' vote, as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(f) Where shareholders' action under this section does not satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the transaction by reason of the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or a provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization requirements must be taken by the shareholders, in which action shares that are not qualified shares may participate.</p>

                  <p>(i) Action by qualified directors disclaiming the corporation's interest in the opportunity is taken in compliance with the procedures set forth in W.S. 17-16-862, as if the decision being made concerned a director's conflicting interest transaction; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Shareholders' action disclaiming the corporation's interest in the opportunity is taken in compliance with the procedures set forth in W.S. 17-16-863, as if the decision being made concerned a director's conflicting interest transaction, except that, rather than making required disclosure as defined in W.S. 17-16-860, in each case the director shall have made prior disclosure to those acting on behalf of the corporation of all material facts concerning the business opportunity that are then known to the director.</p>
                  <p>(b) In any proceeding seeking equitable relief or other remedies based upon an alleged improper taking advantage of a business opportunity by a director, the fact that the director did not employ the procedure described in subsection (a) of this section before taking advantage of the opportunity shall not create an inference that the opportunity should have been first presented to the corporation or alter the burden of proof otherwise applicable to establish that the director breached a duty to the corporation in the circumstances.</p>

                  <p>(a) Unless the articles of incorporation specifically prohibit the adoption of a bylaw pursuant to this section, alter the vote specified in W.S. 17-16-728(a) or provide for cumulative voting, a public corporation may elect in its bylaws to be governed in the election of directors as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Each vote entitled to be cast may be voted for or against up to that number of candidates that is equal to the number of directors to be elected, or a shareholder may indicate an abstention, but without cumulating the votes;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To be elected, a nominee shall have received a plurality of the votes cast by holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present, provided that a nominee who is elected but receives more votes against than for election shall serve as a director for a term that shall terminate on the date that is the earlier of ninety (90) days from the date on which the voting results are determined pursuant to W.S. 17-16-729(b)(v) or is the date on which an individual is selected by the board of directors to fill the office held by such director, which selection shall be deemed to constitute the filling of a vacancy by the board to which W.S. 17-16-810 applies. Subject to paragraph (iii) of this subsection, a nominee who is elected but receives more votes against than for election shall not serve as a director beyond the ninety (90) day period referenced above; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The board of directors may select any qualified individual to fill the office held by a director who received more votes against than for election.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to an election of directors by a voting group if at the expiration of the time fixed under a provision requiring advance notification of director candidates, or absent such a provision, at a time fixed by the board of directors which is not more than fourteen (14) days before notice is given of the meeting at which the election is to occur, there are more candidates for election by the voting group than the number of directors to be elected, one (1) or more of whom are properly proposed by shareholders. An individual shall not be considered a candidate for purposes of this subsection if the board of directors determines before the notice of meeting is given that such individual's candidacy does not create a bona fide election contest.</p>
                  <p>(c) A bylaw electing to be governed by this section may be repealed:</p>
                  <p>(i) If originally adopted by the shareholders, only by the shareholders, unless the bylaw otherwise provides; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) If adopted by the board of directors, by the board of directors or the shareholders.</p>

                  <p>(d) If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the shareholders' meeting at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity, the notice shall also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation or organizational documents of that corporation or other entity.</p>
                  <p>If the corporation is to be merged into a corporation or other entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of incorporation or organizational documents of the new corporation or other entity.</p>
                  <p>(e) Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c) of this section require a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum exists, and, if any class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or share exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is present.</p>
                  <p>(f) Separate voting by voting groups is required:</p>
                  <p>(i) On a plan of merger by each class or series of shares that:</p>
                  <p>(A) Are to be converted under the plan of merger into other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Would be entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by separate voting groups under W.S. 17-16-1004;</p>
                  <p>(ii) On a plan of share exchange by each class or series of shares included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) On a plan of merger or share exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of merger or share exchange.</p>
                  <p>(g) Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, approval by the corporation's shareholders of a plan of merger or share exchange is not required if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The corporation will survive the merger or is the acquiring corporation in a share exchange;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except for amendments permitted by W.S. 17-16-1005, its articles of incorporation will not be changed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Each shareholder of the corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger or share exchange will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the effective date of change; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The issuance in the merger or share exchange of shares or other securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares does not require a vote under W.S. 17-16-621(f).</p>
                  <p>(h) If as a result of a merger or share exchange one (1) or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange shall require the execution, by each shareholder of the domestic corporation, of a separate written consent to become subject to owner liability.</p>
                  <p>(j) After a merger or share exchange is authorized, and at any time before articles of merger or share exchange are filed, the planned merger or share exchange may be abandoned, subject to any contractual rights, without further shareholder action, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the plan of merger or share exchange or, if none is set forth, in the manner determined by the board of directors.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-16-1202. Shareholder approval of certain dispositions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of assets, other than a disposition described in W.S. 17-16-1201, requires approval of the corporation's shareholders if the disposition would leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity. If a significant business activity of the corporation prior to any such disposition of assets was the active or passive holding, maintenance or management of investments, then such holding, maintenance or management of investments shall be considered a significant continuing business activity. If a corporation retains a business activity that represented at least twenty-five percent (25%) of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and twenty-five percent (25%) of either income from continuing operations before taxes or revenues from continuing operations for that fiscal year, in each case of the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity.</p>
                  <p>(b) A disposition that requires approval of the shareholders under subsection (a) of this section shall be initiated by a resolution by the board of directors authorizing the disposition. After adoption of such a resolution, the board of directors shall submit the proposed disposition to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the proposed disposition, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board of directors may condition its submission of a disposition to the shareholders under subsection (b) of this section on any basis.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a disposition is required to be approved by the shareholders under subsection (a) of this section and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the disposition is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the disposition and shall contain a description of the disposition, including the terms and conditions thereof and the consideration to be received by the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(e) Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors, acting pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, require a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of a disposition by the shareholders shall require the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum exists.</p>
                  <p>(f) After a disposition has been approved by the shareholders under subsection (b) of this section and at any time before the disposition has been consummated, it may be abandoned by the corporation without action by the shareholders, subject to any contractual rights of other parties to the disposition.</p>
                  <p>(g) A disposition of assets in the course of dissolution under article 14 is not governed by this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) For purposes of this section, the ownership interests of a parent corporation in its subsidiaries, whether owned directly by the parent corporation or indirectly through other subsidiaries shall be valued at the net asset values of such subsidiaries, without application of any discount to the valuation of such ownership interests because of a lack of marketability or otherwise.</p>

When two (2) or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of voting their shares of the corporation, each member of the group formed thereby is deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership, as of the date of the agreement, of all voting shares of the corporation beneficially owned by any member of the group;</p>

                  <p>(a) A shareholder who receives notice pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1322 and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights shall sign and return the form sent by the corporation and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit his certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to in the notice pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1322(b)(ii)(B). In addition, if applicable, the shareholder shall certify on the form whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1322(b)(i).</p>
                  <p>If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the shareholder's shares as after acquired shares under W.S. 17-16-1324. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder's certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the signed forms, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder, unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The shareholder who has complied with subsection (a) of this section may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the corporation in writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1322(b)(ii)(E). A shareholder who fails to so withdraw from the appraisal process may not thereafter withdraw without the corporation's written consent.</p>
                  <p>(c) A shareholder who does not sign and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit his share certificates where required, each by the date set forth in the notice described in W.S. 17-16-1322(b), is not entitled to payment under this article.</p>

If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within the sixty (60) day period, it shall pay each shareholder demanding appraisal rights whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1326 plus interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the district court of the county where a corporation's principal office, or if none in this state, its registered office, is located.

The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the shareholders demanding appraisal rights acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:</p>
                  <p>(i) Against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of W.S. 17-16-1320 through 17-16-1326; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of counsel and any other expenses incurred for any shareholder demanding appraisal were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly situated, and that the fees for those services and other expenses should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may direct that those fees and expenses be paid out of the amounts awarded the shareholders who were benefited.</p>
                  <p>(d) To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1324, 17-16-1325 or 17-16-1326, the shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed, and to the extent successful, shall be entitled to recover from the corporation all expenses of the suit.</p>

Reinstatement may be denied by the secretary of state if the corporation has been the subject of secretary of state and law enforcement investigation pertaining to fraud or any other violation of state or federal law, or if there is other reason to believe the corporation was engaged in illegal operations. The application shall:</p>

                  <p>(b) If the secretary of state determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (a) of this section and that the information is correct, he shall cancel the certificate of dissolution and prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites his determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original of the certificate, and serve a copy on the corporation under W.S. 17-28-104.</p>
                  <p>(c) When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred.</p>

                  <p>(a) A court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation may appoint one (1) or more receivers to wind up and liquidate, or one (1) or more custodians to manage, the business and affairs of the corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the corporation and all of its property wherever located.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court may appoint an individual or a domestic or foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this state as a receiver or custodian. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to time. Among other powers:</p>
                  <p>(i) The receiver may:</p>
                  <p>(A) Dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Sue and defend in his own name as receiver of the corporation in all Wyoming courts.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its board of directors or officers, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs of the corporation in the best interests of its shareholders and creditors.</p>
                  <p>(d) The court during a receivership may redesignate the receiver a custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver, if doing so is in the best interests of the corporation, its shareholders and creditors.</p>
                  <p>(e) The court from time to time during the receivership or custodianship may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the receiver or custodian and his counsel from the assets of the corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets.</p>

                  <p>(b) After entering the decree of dissolution, the court shall direct the winding up and liquidation of the corporation's business and affairs in accordance with W.S. 17-16-1405 and the notification of claimants in accordance with W.S. 17-16-1406 and 17-16-1407.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-16-1434. Election to purchase in lieu of dissolution.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) In a proceeding under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) to dissolve a corporation that has no shares listed on a national securities exchange or regularly traded in a market maintained by one (1) or more members of a national or affiliated securities association, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect, one (1) or more shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares. An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.</p>
                  <p>(b) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety (90) days after the filing of the petition under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one (1) or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten (10) days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one (1) or more shareholders, the proceeding under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of his shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale or other disposition.</p>
                  <p>(c) If, within sixty (60) days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value in terms of purchase of the petitioner's shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner's shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) proceedings and determine the fair value of the petitioner's shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interest of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by the shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that the holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii)(B) or (D), it may award to the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of any experts employed by him.</p>
                  <p>(f) Upon entry of an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under W.S. 17-16-1430, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.</p>
                  <p>(g) The purchase order pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be made within ten (10) days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1402 and 17-16-1403, which articles must then be adopted and filed within fifty (50) days thereafter. Upon filing of such articles of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with provisions of W.S. 17-16-1405 through 17-16-1407, and the order entered pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall no longer be of any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) of this section and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section, other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, is subject to the provisions of W.S. 17-16-640.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-16-1535. Reinstatement following revocation of certificate of authority.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An officer or other person with proper authority at the time a foreign corporation had its certificate of authority revoked under W.S. 17-16-1531 may apply to the secretary of state for reinstatement of its certificate of authority within two (2) years after the effective date of revocation. Reinstatement may be denied by the secretary of state if the corporation has been the subject of a secretary of state and law enforcement investigation pertaining to fraud or any other violation of state or federal law, or if there is other reason to believe the corporation was engaged in illegal operations. The application shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of the revocation of its certificate of authority;</p>
                  <p>(ii) State that the ground or grounds for revocation either did not exist or have been eliminated;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Reserved;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If the foreign corporation's certificate of authority was revoked for failing to deliver its annual report or pay the annual license taxes to the secretary of state when due pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1630, include payment of fees and taxes then delinquent and a reinstatement certificate fee prescribed pursuant to W.S. 17-16-122;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the foreign corporation's certificate of authority was revoked for failure to maintain a registered agent, include payment of a two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) reinstatement fee and payment of any fees and taxes then delinquent; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) Include proof that the foreign corporation is currently in good standing in the state of formation.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the secretary of state determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (a) of this section and that the information is correct, he shall cancel the certificate of revocation and prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites his determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original of the certificate, and serve a copy on the corporation under W.S. 17-28-104.</p>
                  <p>(c) When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the revocation of the certificate of authority and the foreign corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the revocation had never occurred.</p>
                  <p>(d) The foreign corporation shall retain its registered corporate name during the two (2) year reinstatement period.</p>
                  <p>(e) If more than two (2) years has elapsed since the revocation of a foreign corporation's certificate of authority, the foreign corporation may reapply for a certificate of authority to transact business pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1503. If the foreign corporation continues transacting business in Wyoming after the two (2) year period elapsed, the foreign corporation shall be subject to the penalty for transacting business without authority as set forth in W.S. 17-16-1502(d).</p>
                  <p>(f) A person who files any document under this section without proper corporate authority to do so is in violation of W.S. 6-5-308.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the secretary of state denies a foreign corporation's application for reinstatement following administrative revocation, he shall serve the corporation under W.S. 17-28-104 with a written notice that explains the reason or reasons for denial.</p>
                  <p>(b) The foreign corporation may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the district court within thirty (30) days after service of the notice of denial is perfected. The foreign corporation appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the revocation and attaching to the petition copies of the secretary of state's certificate of revocation, the foreign corporation's application for reinstatement and the secretary of state's notice of denial.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court may summarily order the secretary of state to reinstate the foreign corporation's certificate of authority or may take other action the court considers appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(d) The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings.</p>

                  <p>(g) A resolution to transfer the corporation to another jurisdiction shall be adopted by the board of directors, and shall thereafter be submitted to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the resolution, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination. The board of directors may condition its submission of the resolution to the shareholders on any basis.

The notice shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the resolution and of the articles of incorporation of the corporation as they will be in effect in the new jurisdiction immediately after the transfer. Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, approval of the resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum, consisting of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast, is present, and, if any class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate group on the resolution, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the resolution by that voting group exists. Separate voting by voting groups is required to the extent the same would be required for a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation.</p>

The secretary of state may issue a certificate of registration upon receipt of an application supported by articles of continuance as provided by this act together with the statements, information and documents set out in subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section. The certificate of registration may then be issued subject to any limitations and conditions and may contain any provisions as may appear proper to the secretary of state.</p>
                  <p>(b) The secretary of state shall cause notice of issuance of a certificate of registration to be given forthwith to the proper officer of the jurisdiction in which the corporation was previously incorporated.</p>
                  <p>(c) The articles of continuance filed by a foreign corporation with the secretary of state shall contain:</p>
                  <p>(i) A certified copy of its original articles of incorporation and all amendments thereto or its equivalent basic corporate charter or other authorization;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The name of the corporation and the jurisdiction under the laws of which it is incorporated;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The date of incorporation and the period of duration of the corporation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The address of the principal office of the corporation;</p>
                  <p>(v) The address of the proposed registered office of the corporation in this state and the name of its proposed registered agent in this state at the address;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The purpose or purposes of the corporation which it proposes to pursue in the transaction of business in this state;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The names and respective business addresses of the directors and officers of the corporation;</p>
                  <p>(viii) A statement of the aggregate number of shares or other ownership units which the corporation has authority to issue, itemized by classes, par value of shares, shares without par value and series, if any, within a class;</p>
                  <p>(ix) A statement of the aggregate number of issued shares or other ownership units itemized by classes, par value of shares, shares without par value and series, if any, within a class;</p>
                  <p>(x) Such additional information concerning capital structure or financial status as the secretary of state deems necessary to establish fees;</p>
                  <p>(xi) A statement that the corporation accepts the constitution of this state in compliance with the requirements of article 10, section 5 of the Wyoming constitution;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any additional information necessary or appropriate to enable the secretary of state to determine whether the corporation is entitled to a certificate of registration evidencing its authority to transact business in the state and to determine and to assess any fees and taxes under the laws of this state;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Any additional information permitted in articles of incorporation under W.S. 17-16-202.</p>
                  <p>(d) The application shall be executed by the corporation by its president or other officer, director, trustee, manager or person performing functions equivalent to those of a president and who is authorized to execute the application on behalf of the corporation and shall be verified by the officer signing the application.</p>
                  <p>(e) The provisions of the articles of continuance may, without expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the corporation's articles of incorporation or equivalent basic corporate charter or other authorization, if the variation is one which a corporation incorporated under the Wyoming Business Corporation Act could effect by way of amendment to its articles of incorporation. Upon issuance of a certificate of continuance by the secretary of state, the articles of continuance shall be deemed to be the articles of incorporation of the continued corporation. The corporation may elect to incorporate by reference in the articles of continuance its basic corporate charter or other authorization which had been adopted by the corporation in the foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the same to continue to act as the articles of incorporation of the corporation, provided, however, that such basic corporate charter or other authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make the same conform to the laws of Wyoming and to the provisions of the articles of continuance.</p>
                  <p>(f) Except for the purpose of W.S. 16-6-101 through 16-6-118, the existence of any corporation heretofore or hereafter issued a certificate of continuation under this act shall be deemed to have commenced on the date the corporation commenced its existence in the jurisdiction in which the corporation was first formed, incorporated or otherwise came into being. The laws of Wyoming shall apply to a corporation continuing under this act to the same extent as if the corporation had been incorporated under the laws of Wyoming from and after the issuance of a certificate of continuation under this act by the secretary of state to the corporation. When a foreign corporation is continued as a corporation under this act, such continuance shall not affect the corporation's ownership of its property or liability for any existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened prosecutions or civil or administrative actions, convictions, rulings, orders, judgments, or any other characteristics or aspects of the corporation and its existence.</p>
                  <p>(g) A share of stock of a foreign corporation issued before the corporation's continuance in Wyoming is deemed to have been issued in compliance with the Wyoming Business Corporation Act and the provisions of the articles of continuance, irrespective of whether the share is fully paid and nonassessable, and irrespective of any designation, rights, privileges, restrictions or conditions set out on or referred to in the certificate representing the share, and irrespective of whether the certificate is in registered or bearer form. Continuance under this act does not deprive a stockholder of any right or privilege that he claims under, or relieve the stockholder of any liability in respect of, an issued share.</p>
                  <p>(h) As used in this section, the term "corporation" shall include any incorporated organization, foundation, trust, association, or similar entity which appears to the secretary of state to possess characteristics sufficiently similar to those of a corporation organized under the Wyoming Business Corporation Act.</p>
                  <p>(j) This act applies to all corporations continued in Wyoming on the effective date of this act. The repeal of any statute or part thereof by this act shall have such effect as is provided in W.S. 17-16-1703.</p>

                  <p>(a) The following statement must appear conspicuously on each share certificate issued by a statutory close corporation:</p>
                  <p>The rights of shareholders in a statutory close corporation may differ materially from the rights of shareholders in other corporations. Copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, shareholders' agreements, and other documents, any of which may restrict transfers and affect voting and other rights, may be obtained by a shareholder on written request to the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated shares, the corporation shall send to the shareholders a written notice containing the information required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The notice required by this section satisfies all requirements of this chapter and of W.S. 17-16-627 that notice of share transfer restrictions be given.</p>

                  <p>(a) An interest in shares of a statutory close corporation may not be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred, by operation of law or otherwise, except to the extent permitted by the articles of incorporation or under W.S. 17-17-112 or pursuant to a buy-sell agreement entered into by all the shareholders.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except to the extent the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, this section does not apply to a transfer:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the corporation or to any other holder of the same class or series of shares;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To members of the shareholder's immediate family, or to a trust, all of whose beneficiaries are members of the shareholder's immediate family, which immediate family consists of his spouse, parents, lineal descendants, including adopted children and stepchildren, and the spouse of any lineal descendant, and brothers and sisters;</p>

                  <p>(a) A person desiring to transfer shares of a statutory close corporation subject to the transfer prohibition of W.S. 17-17-111 must first offer them to the corporation by obtaining an offer to purchase the shares for cash from a third person who is eligible to purchase the shares under subsection (b) of this section. The offer by the third person must be in writing and state the offeror's name and address, the number and class, or series, of shares offered, the offering price per share, and the other terms of the offer.</p>
                  <p>(b) A third person is eligible to purchase the shares if:</p>
                  <p>(i) He is eligible to become a qualified shareholder under any federal or state tax statute the corporation has adopted and he agrees in writing not to terminate his qualification without the approval of the remaining shareholders; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) His purchase of the shares will not impose a personal holding company tax or similar federal or state penalty tax on the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(c) The person desiring to transfer shares shall deliver the offer to the corporation, and by doing so offers to sell the shares to the corporation on the terms of the offer. Within twenty (20) days after the corporation receives the offer, the corporation shall call a special shareholders' meeting, to be held not more than forty (40) days after the call, to decide whether the corporation should purchase all, but not less than all, of the offered shares. The offer must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, excluding votes in respect of the shares covered by the offer.</p>
                  <p>(d) The corporation must deliver to the offering shareholder written notice of acceptance within seventy-five (75) days after receiving the offer or the offer is rejected.</p>
                  <p>If the corporation makes a counteroffer, the shareholder must deliver to the corporation written notice of acceptance within fifteen (15) days after receiving the counteroffer or the counteroffer is rejected. If the corporation accepts the original offer or the shareholder accepts the corporation's counteroffer, the shareholder shall deliver to the corporation duly endorsed certificates for the shares, or instruct the corporation in writing to transfer the shares if uncertificated, within twenty (20) days after the effective date of the notice of acceptance. The corporation may specifically enforce the shareholder's delivery or instruction obligation under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) A corporation accepting an offer to purchase shares under this section may allocate some or all of the shares to one (1) or more of its shareholders or to other persons if all the shareholders voting in favor of the purchase approve the allocation. If the corporation has more than one (1) class or series of shares, however, the remaining holders of the class or series of shares being purchased are entitled to a first option to purchase the shares not purchased by the corporation in proportion to their shareholdings or in some other proportion agreed to by all the shareholders participating in the purchase.</p>
                  <p>(f) If an offer to purchase shares under this section is rejected, the offering shareholder, for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days after the corporation received his offer, is entitled to transfer to the third person offeror all, but not less than all, of the offered shares in accordance with the terms of his offer to the corporation.</p>

                  <p>(a) An attempt to transfer shares in a statutory close corporation in violation of a prohibition against transfer binding on the transferee is ineffective.</p>
                  <p>(b) An attempt to transfer shares in a statutory close corporation in violation of a prohibition against transfer that is not binding on the transferee, either because the notice required by W.S. 17-17-110 was not given or because the prohibition is held unenforceable by a court, gives the corporation an option to purchase the shares from the transferee for the same price and on the same terms that he purchased them. To exercise its option, the corporation must give the transferee written notice within thirty (30) days after they are presented for registration in the transferee's name. The corporation may specifically enforce the transferee's sale obligation upon exercise of its purchase option.</p>

                  <p>(a) This section, and W.S. 17-17-115 through 17-17-117, apply to a statutory close corporation only if so provided in its articles of incorporation. If these sections apply, the personal representative of the estate or the surviving joint tenant of a deceased shareholder may require the corporation to purchase or cause to be purchased all, but not less than all, of the decedent's shares or jointly owned shares or to be dissolved.</p>
                  <p>(b) The provisions of W.S. 17-17-115 through 17-17-117 may be modified only if the modification is set forth or referred to in the articles of incorporation.</p>
                  <p>(c) An amendment to the articles of incorporation to provide for application of W.S. 17-17-115 through 17-17-117, or to modify or delete the provisions of these sections, must be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes of each class or series of shares of the statutory close corporation, voting as separate voting groups, whether or not otherwise entitled to vote on amendments. If the corporation has no shareholders when the amendment is proposed, it must be approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the subscribers for shares, if any, or, if none, by all of the incorporators.</p>
                  <p>(d) A shareholder who votes against an amendment to modify or delete the provisions of W.S. 17-17-115 through 17-17-117 is entitled to dissenters' rights under W.S. 17-16-1301 through 17-16-1331 if the amendment upon adoption terminates or substantially alters his existing rights under these sections to have his shares purchased.</p>
                  <p>(e) A shareholder may waive his and his estate's rights under W.S. 17-17-115 through 17-17-117 by a signed writing.</p>
                  <p>(f) W.S. 17-17-115 through 17-17-117 do not prohibit any other agreement providing for the purchase of shares upon a shareholder's death, nor do they prevent a shareholder from enforcing any remedy he has independent of these sections.</p>

                  <p>(b) Within twenty (20) days after the effective date of the notice, the corporation shall call a special shareholders' meeting, to be held not more than forty (40) days after the call, to decide whether the corporation should offer to purchase the shares. A purchase offer must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, excluding votes in respect of the shares covered by the notice.</p>
                  <p>(c) The corporation must deliver a purchase offer to the person requesting it within seventy-five (75) days after the effective date of the request notice. A purchase offer must be accompanied by the corporation's balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not more than sixteen (16) months before the effective date of the request notice, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in shareholders' equity for that year, and the latest available interim financial statements, if any.

                  <p>(d) A corporation agreeing to purchase shares under this section may allocate some or all of the shares to one (1) or more of its shareholders or to other persons if all the shareholders voting in favor of the purchase offer approve the allocation. If the corporation has more than one (1) class or series of shares, however, the remaining holders of the class or series of shares being purchased are entitled to a first option to purchase the shares not purchased by the corporation in proportion to their shareholdings or in some other proportion agreed to by all the shareholders participating in the purchase.</p>
                  <p>(e) If price and other terms of a compulsory purchase of shares are fixed or are to be determined by the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a written agreement, the price and terms so fixed or determined govern the compulsory purchase unless the purchaser defaults, in which event the buyer is entitled to commence a proceeding for dissolution under W.S. 17-17-116.</p>

                  <p>(a) If an offer to purchase shares made under W.S. 17-17-115 is rejected, or if no offer is made, the person exercising the compulsory purchase right may commence a proceeding against the corporation to compel the purchase in the district court of the county where the corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located. The corporation at its expense shall notify in writing all of its shareholders, and any other person the court directs, of the commencement of the proceeding. The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under this subsection is plenary and exclusive.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court shall determine the fair value of the shares subject to compulsory purchase in accordance with the standards set forth in W.S. 17-17-142 together with terms for the purchase. Upon making these determinations the court shall order the corporation to purchase or cause the purchase of the shares or empower the person exercising the compulsory purchase right to have the corporation dissolved.</p>
                  <p>(c) After the purchase order is entered, the corporation may petition the court to modify the terms of purchase and the court may do so if it finds that changes in the financial or legal ability of the corporation or other purchaser to complete the purchase justify a modification.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the corporation or other purchaser does not make a payment required by the court's order within thirty (30) days of its due date, the seller may petition the court to dissolve the corporation and, absent a showing of good cause for not making the payment, the court shall do so.</p>
                  <p>(e) A person making a payment to prevent or cure a default by the corporation or other purchaser is entitled to recover the payment from the defaulter.</p>

                  <p>(a) All the shareholders of a statutory close corporation may agree in writing to regulate the exercise of the corporate powers and the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the shareholders of the corporation.</p>
                  <p>(b) An agreement authorized by this section is effective although:</p>

                  <p>(ii) It restricts the discretion or powers of the board or authorizes director proxies or weighted voting rights;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Its effect is to treat the corporation as a partnership; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) It creates a relationship among the shareholders or between the shareholders and the corporation that would otherwise be appropriate only among partners.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the corporation has a board of directors, an agreement authorized by this section restricting the discretion or powers of the board relieves directors of liability imposed by law, and imposes that liability on each person in whom the board's discretion or power is vested, to the extent that the discretion or powers of the board of directors are governed by the agreement.</p>
                  <p>(d) A provision eliminating a board of directors in an agreement authorized by this section is not effective unless the articles of incorporation contain a statement to that effect as required by W.S. 17-17-121.</p>
                  <p>(e) A provision entitling one (1) or more shareholders to dissolve the corporation under W.S. 17-17-133 is effective only if a statement of this right is contained in the articles of incorporation.</p>

                  <p>(iii) A shareholder is not liable for his act or omission, although a director would be, unless the shareholder was entitled to vote on the action;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A requirement by a state or the United States that a document delivered for filing contain a statement that specified action has been taken by the board of directors is satisfied by a statement that the corporation is a statutory close corporation without a board of directors and that the action was approved by the shareholders; and</p>

                  <p>(a) If the court finds that the ordinary relief described in W.S. 17-17-141(a) is or would be inadequate or inappropriate, it may order the corporation dissolved under W.S. 17-17-143 unless the corporation or one (1) or more of its shareholders purchases all the shares of the shareholder for their fair value and on terms determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the court orders a share purchase, it shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Determine the fair value of the shares, considering among other relevant evidence the going concern value of the corporation, any agreement among some or all of the shareholders fixing the price or specifying a formula for determining share value for any purpose, the recommendations of appraisers, if any, appointed by the court, and any legal constraints on the corporation's ability to purchase the shares;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Specify the terms of the purchase, including if appropriate terms for installment payments, subordination of the purchase obligation to the rights of the corporation's other creditors, security for a deferred purchase price, and a covenant not to compete or other restriction on the seller;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Require the seller to deliver all his shares to the purchaser upon receipt of the purchase price or the first installment of the purchase price;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Provide that after the seller delivers his shares he has no further claim against the corporation, its directors, officers or shareholders, other than a claim to any unpaid balance of the purchase price and a claim under any agreement with the corporation or the remaining shareholders that is not terminated by the court; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Provide that if the purchase is not completed in accordance with the specified terms, the corporation is to be dissolved under W.S. 17-17-143.</p>
                  <p>(c) After the purchase order is entered, any party may petition the court to modify the terms of the purchase and the court may do so if it finds that changes in the financial or legal ability of the corporation or other purchaser to complete the purchase justify a modification.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the corporation is dissolved because the share purchase was not completed in accordance with the court's order, the selling shareholder has the same rights and priorities in the corporation's assets as if the sale had not been ordered.</p>

                  <p>(a) The court may dissolve the corporation if it finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) There are one (1) or more grounds for judicial dissolution under W.S. 17-16-1430; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) All other relief ordered by the court under W.S. 17-17-141 or 17-17-142 has failed to resolve the matters in dispute.</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining whether to dissolve the corporation, the court shall consider among other relevant evidence the financial condition of the corporation but may not refuse to dissolve solely because the corporation has accumulated earnings or current operating profits.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Through a statement in the bylaws that the corporation elects not to be subject to the restrictions in W.S. 17-18-104(b). This election shall be effective immediately upon adoption of the bylaws, unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) By filing a statement making the election with the secretary of state. This election shall be authorized by the corporation's board of directors and shall be effective from the date of filing with the secretary of state.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 1990, ch. 62, § § 2, 3.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 1990, ch. 62, § § 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>(d) The election not to be subject to the restrictions on business combinations may be revoked in the same manner as the elections are made. With respect to any interested stockholder the election not to be subject to the restrictions shall not be effective for a period of three (3) years after the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.</p>

In addition to all other remedies, he may bring an action in any district court in the name and on behalf of the state of Wyoming against any person or persons participating in or about to participate in a violation of this act to enjoin those persons from continuing or doing any act in violation of this act or to enforce compliance with this act. In any court proceedings the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply.</p>
                  <p>(b) Whenever it is reasonably believed that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of this act or any regulation or order adopted under this act, the offeror, target company or any record or beneficial owner of an equity security of the target company may bring an action in the district court of the county where the target company has its principal office or Natrona county to enjoin that person from continuing or doing any act in violation of this act or to enforce compliance with this act.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon a proper showing, the court may grant a permanent or preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order or may order rescission of any sales, tenders for sale, purchases or tenders for purchase of equity securities determined to be unlawful under this act or any rule or regulation or order of the secretary of state. The court shall not require the secretary of state to post a bond.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-18-116. Proxies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any qualified corporation may in its articles of incorporation restrict or prohibit the use of proxies to vote shares. The restriction or prohibition may be effective for:</p>
                  <p>(i) All meetings;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All meetings and issues with any specific exceptions the board of directors authorizes; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any meetings or any issues or both that the board of directors specifies.</p>
                  <p>(b) The restriction or prohibitions on the use of proxies apply only to meetings including adjournments of meetings held within the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding any prohibition or restriction on the use of proxies, the beneficial owner of any shares entitled to vote shall always be entitled to vote the shares in person. If the beneficial owner of the shares is a minor or is incompetent, the shares may be voted in person by a trustee, a guardian, or a parent acting as trustee under the Wyoming Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or a similar act. If the beneficial owner of the shares is an entity other than a natural person, the shares may be voted by any duly authorized officer of that entity.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any restrictions imposed on persons who may be appointed to act as proxies shall not discriminate on their face in favor of management and against any shareholders opposed to management.</p>
                  <p>(e) The board may restrict appointment as proxies to specific individuals designated by the corporation provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) Shareholders are given the opportunity to give binding instructions as to how the shares are to be voted on any issues or in any elections that management is aware of at least thirty (30) days before it mails materials seeking proxies;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The corporation serves notice in writing on any shareholder who has requested in writing the notice within the past year of the deadline for submission of material on any issue that may arise at the meeting. The notice shall be given at least ten (10) days before the deadline;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The individuals designated for appointment as proxies agree to vote all valid proxies according to the shareholder instructions given; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) A meeting may not be adjourned sine die to prevent a vote on an issue if a quorum is present and the required majority either by proxy or in person has had an opportunity to indicate and has indicated an intention to vote against the recommendation of the board or management of the corporation on that issue.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the articles of incorporation permit the board to impose restrictions on the use of proxies and a court orders a shareholder's meeting, the board may still impose the restrictions provided if it does so within ten (10) days of the meeting or within half the total number of days between the date of the court order and the date of the meeting, whichever is less. The time periods for notice of issues and mailing deadlines set forth in subsection (e) of this section shall not apply to court ordered meetings.</p>

                  <p>(b) A qualified corporation in its bylaws may deny shareholders the right to copy the list of shareholders prior to the meeting provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Arrangements are made for an independent firm to provide to shareholders any information any stockholder wants to send them relative to the matters to be considered at the meeting provided the stockholder pays for the mailing and provides the material in a timely fashion; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The list is made available at the shareholder's expense to any shareholder at or after the meeting who is bringing a legal challenge to the right of any other shareholder to vote at the meeting; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The list is available for inspection but not copying as provided by subsection (a) of this section and at the meeting. The making of handwritten copies by the shareholder or his attorney of the names and addresses of individual shareholders shall not be construed as copying within the meaning of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) A qualified corporation may take any other steps it deems reasonable or necessary to prevent the use of its shareholder lists for purposes not related to issues under consideration at a shareholder meeting.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Provide a longer period between the receipt of the request for a special meeting and the date that notice of the meeting is given than is allowed by W.S. 17-16-703(a)(ii)(A);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Give the board discretion to require that the issues for which a special meeting is requested be considered instead at the next annual meeting if the request for the special meeting is made within a number of days of the annual meeting specified in the bylaws.</p>

                  <p>(a) Stockholders present or represented by proxy at an annual or special meeting of a qualified corporation at which a quorum is not present may take only the following actions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Ratify or reject the independent auditors selected by the board if the corporation's bylaws or articles of incorporation require approval of the auditors by a stockholder's meeting;</p>
                  <p>(ii) With the consent of the officer presiding at the meeting, receive or hear any reports on the affairs of the corporation that may be presented;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Within the constraints of the time allowed on the agenda, ask questions concerning the affairs of the corporation of any officer or board member present;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Adjourn or recess the meeting to allow time to assemble a quorum, but they may not adjourn or recess to a different city and the total of all the adjournments and recesses may not exceed two (2) business days without the consent of the board of directors;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a quorum is not present, may adjourn the meeting sine die, provided the motion to adjourn sine die shall not be in order until at least two (2) hours have passed since the time specified for the start of the meeting and the time at which the meeting was called to order.</p>
                  <p>(b) If an annual meeting of a qualified corporation is adjourned sine die without achieving a quorum, the requirement of W.S. 17-16-701 to hold an annual meeting is satisfied. The board of directors may call a second annual meeting to take the place of the one adjourned without a quorum, but the board is not obligated to do so unless required to do so by the bylaws or articles of incorporation.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a special meeting of a qualified corporation is adjourned sine die without achieving a quorum or without achieving the quorum necessary to do all or part of the business for which the meeting was required, the board of directors may call another special meeting, but is not obligated to do so unless required by the bylaws or articles of incorporation. The remedy of a stockholder aggrieved by a failure of the board to call another special meeting shall be to follow the procedures necessary for calling a new special meeting.</p>
                  <p>(d) If different quorums are required for different matters, the absence of a quorum on one (1) issue shall not affect the ability of the meeting to act on other issues where a quorum is present.</p>

                  <p>(a) A qualified corporation may, if its articles of incorporation authorize it to utilize the bondholder protection provisions of this act, utilize any of the provisions set forth in subsection (b) of this section. These protections shall apply only to bonds, debentures or other debt instruments whose original aggregate value at maturity is equal to or greater than five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) and whose original term is two (2) years or greater. Any number of bondholder protection provisions may be in effect at any time.</p>
                  <p>(b) A qualified corporation may provide bondholder protection by requiring any or all of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Bondholder approval of the replacement of more than twenty-four percent (24%) of the directors in any twelve (12) month period. The filling of vacancies created by the death or resignation of directors shall not be counted against the twenty-four percent (24%) limit provided that those vacancies are filled by nominees of the board of directors. If more than twenty-four percent (24%) of the directors are to be replaced, the approval of holders of a majority of the bonds shall be obtained in writing at the meeting where the directors are to be replaced or no more than thirty (30) days prior to the meeting. The consent of the bondholders shall be obtained to exceeding the twenty-four percent (24%) limit rather than to the individual directors to be replaced. If consent is denied, which directors are to be replaced shall be determined by the relative number of votes for each director by shares entitled to vote;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Bondholder consent to any merger or acquisition which the corporation may be subject to or which the corporation may make, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) The notice of bondholder protection shall specify the size of merger or acquisition at or above which the bondholder consent is required. The size may vary depending on whether the company is the acquiring party or is being acquired. In a merger the relative memberships on the board of directors of the surviving corporation may be used to determine whether or not bondholder consent is required;</p>
                  <p>(B) The term acquisition shall be deemed to include the purchase of more than a specified percentage of the shares entitled to vote for directors by a person or combination of persons under common ownership or control or acting in concert. If a person or combination of persons acquires more than the specified percentage of shares, they shall be entitled to vote only the specified percentage until bondholder consent is acquired. The specified percentage shall be set in the notice of bondholder protection and shall not be less than ten percent (10%);</p>
                  <p>(C) The bondholder consent shall be to a specific merger or acquisition rather than the general concept of mergers and acquisitions.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Bondholder consent to the sale or disposal of certain assets, or assets exceeding a certain percentage of the corporation's total assets, or assets exceeding a set total value or any combination of these factors. The specifics of what requires bondholder consent shall be set forth in the notice of bondholder protection. Disposal of assets shall be construed to include the disposition of the assets to the shareholders either directly or through distribution of shares in a new or subsidiary corporation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Bondholder consent to the acquisition of debt above a specified percentage of total assets, a specified percentage of the net worth of the corporation, a specific amount, or any combination of these factors. The consent may be required generally or may be required only if the debt is to be used to pay for a merger or acquisition or a distribution to shareholders. The notice of bondholder protection shall specify the conditions under which bondholder consent is required.</p>

                  <p>(a) The corporation utilizes a bondholder protection provision by adopting and filing with the secretary of state a notice of bondholder protection as provided in this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The notice of bondholder protection shall specify the percentage of bondholders whose consent is required for any action on that protection. The percentage may be different for different purposes. The percentage shall be not less than fifty percent (50%) nor greater than ninety percent (90%). The percentage shall be a percentage of the value at maturity of the bonds or other debt instruments issued and outstanding.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notices of bondholder protection shall be approved by the corporation in the same manner as changes in corporate bylaws except that the articles of incorporation may specify a different manner of approval. The notices shall be filed with the trustee or transfer agent, if any, for the bonds and with the secretary of state. The notice filed with the secretary of state shall be accompanied by the administrative fee specified by regulation to recover the administrative costs of the state of Wyoming. The notice shall be effective as of the date of filing with the secretary of state. The corporation shall send to each known bondholder by first class mail either the full notice of bondholder protection or a summary of the notice and information as to how the full notice may be obtained from the company. This notice to the bondholders shall be given no later than the due date of the first interest payment due more than thirty (30) days after the bondholder protection notice is filed with the secretary of state and may be included with the mailing of the interest payment.</p>
                  <p>(d) Bondholder protections may be revoked by the corporation in the same manner that notices of bondholder protection are issued and filed except that the revocation is effective as of a date specified in the notice filed with the secretary of state. The effective date shall be at least two (2) years and not more than six (6) years after filing the notice of revocation with the secretary of state.</p>

                  <p>(a) At any time any amendment may be made to the bondholder protection provisions with the consent of the percentage of bondholders required for action as stated in the notice of bondholder protection. Such an amendment shall be effective upon filing the bondholder's consent and notice of amendment with the secretary of state. However, the effective date shall be specified in the notice and shall be at least two (2) years and not more than six (6) years after filing the bondholder's consent and notice of the amendment with the secretary of state for amendments which:</p>
                  <p>(i) Change the time period for revocations to be effective;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Decrease the percentage of bondholders required for approval of an action;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Eliminate the requirement of bondholder approval for a specific action; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Otherwise decrease the protection available to bondholders.</p>
                  <p>(b) The bondholder's consent shall be in writing signed by the bondholder or his lawful agent or trustee. Unless otherwise specified in W.S. 17-18-201 through 17-18-206 the consent is valid until revoked by the bondholder. The sale of the bond or debt instrument by the bondholder revokes the consent effective upon notification of the corporation or transfer agent of the sale.</p>

                  <p>(A) One-fifth (1/5) or more but less than one-third (1/3) of all voting power;</p>

                  <p>(X) In good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this article, by a person whose voting rights over control shares have been authorized under W.S. 17-18-306, if the person's voting power after the acquisition would be within the same range of voting power previously authorized under W.S. 17-18-306 for the person.</p>

                  <p>(e) Any meeting or other method of obtaining the vote of members, delegates or directors conducted pursuant to an order issued under this section, and that complies with all the provisions of such order, is for all purposes a valid meeting or vote, as the case may be, and shall have the same force and effect as if it complied with every requirement imposed by the articles, bylaws and this act.</p>

                  <p>(b) Any notice that conforms to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section is fair and reasonable, but other means of giving notice may also be fair and reasonable when all the circumstances are considered; provided, however, that notice of matters referred to in paragraph (c)(ii) of this section shall be given as provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notice is fair and reasonable if:</p>

                  <p>(a) The bylaws of a corporation may fix or provide the manner of fixing a date as the record date for determining the members entitled to notice of a members' meeting. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board may fix a future date as the record date. If no record date is fixed, members at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held, are entitled to notice of the meeting.</p>
                  <p>(b) The bylaws of a corporation may fix or provide the manner of fixing a date as the record date for determining the members entitled to vote at a members' meeting. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board may fix a future date as the record date. If no record date is fixed, members on the date of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting.</p>
                  <p>(c) The bylaws may fix or provide the manner for determining a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board may fix in advance a record date. If no record date is fixed, members at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the resolution relating thereto, or the 60th day prior to the date of such other action, whichever is later, are entitled to exercise rights.</p>
                  <p>(d) A record date fixed under this section shall not be more than seventy (70) days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of members occurs.</p>
                  <p>(e) A determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at a membership meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new date for determining the right to notice or the right to vote, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than seventy (70) days after the record date for determining members entitled to notice of the original meeting.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting, it may provide that the original record date for notice or voting continues in effect or it may fix a new record date for notice or voting.</p>

                  <p>(b) A written ballot shall:</p>

                  <p>(c) Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section shall be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.</p>
                  <p>(d) All solicitations for votes by written ballot shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements;</p>

                  <p>(a) After fixing a record date for a notice of a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its members who are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall show the address and number of votes each member is entitled to vote at the meeting. The corporation shall prepare on a current basis through the time of the membership meeting a list of members, if any, who are entitled to vote at the meeting, but not entitled to notice of the meeting. This list shall be prepared on the same basis and be part of the list of members.</p>
                  <p>(b) The list of members shall be available for inspection by any member for the purpose of communication with other members concerning the meeting, beginning two (2) business days after notice is given of the meeting for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation's principal office or at a reasonable place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A member, a member's agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the limitations of W.S. 17-19-1602(c) and 17-19-1605, to copy the list, at a reasonable time and at the member's expense, during the period it is available for inspection.</p>
                  <p>(c) The corporation shall make the list of members available at the meeting, and any member, a member's agent or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the corporation refuses to allow a member, a member's agent or attorney to inspect the list of members before or at the meeting, or copy the list as permitted by subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section, the district court of the county where a corporation's principal office, or if none in this state, its registered office is located, on application of the member, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete and may order the corporation to pay the member's costs, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred to obtain the order.</p>
                  <p>(e) Unless a written demand to inspect and copy a membership list has been made under subsection (b) of this section prior to the membership meeting and a corporation improperly refuses to comply with the demand, refusal or failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.</p>
                  <p>(f) The articles or bylaws of a religious corporation may limit or abolish the rights of a member under this section to inspect and copy any corporate record.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this act and in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Appointment" means the grant of authority to vote;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Appointment form" means the document appointing the proxy;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Proxy" means the person to whom the authority to vote is granted.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless the articles or bylaws prohibit or limit proxy voting, a member may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointment form either personally or by an attorney-in-fact.</p>
                  <p>(c) An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for eleven (11) months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form; provided however that no proxy shall be valid for more than three (3) years from its date of execution.</p>
                  <p>(d) An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member.</p>
                  <p>(e) The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment.</p>
                  <p>(f) Appointment of a proxy is revoked by the person appointing the proxy:</p>
                  <p>(i) Attending any meeting and voting in person; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Signing and delivering to the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate proxy votes either a writing stating that the appointment of the proxy is revoked or a subsequent appointment form.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the articles or bylaws provide for cumulative voting by members, members may so vote, by multiplying the number of votes the members are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote, and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two (2) or more candidates.</p>
                  <p>(b) Cumulative voting is not authorized at a particular meeting unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The meeting notice or statement accompanying the notice states that cumulative voting will take place; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) A member gives notice during the meeting and before the vote is taken of the member's intent to cumulate votes, and if one (1) member gives this notice all other members participating in the election are entitled to cumulate their votes without giving further notice.</p>
                  <p>(c) A director elected by cumulative voting may be removed by the members without cause if the requirements of W.S. 17-19-808 are met unless the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to removal, would be sufficient to elect the director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast (or, if such action is taken by written ballot, all memberships entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director's most recent election were then being elected.</p>
                  <p>(d) Members shall not cumulatively vote if the directors and members are identical.</p>

                  <p>(a) The members may remove one (1) or more directors elected by them without cause.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a director is elected by a class, chapter or other organizational unit or by region or other geographic grouping, the director may be removed only by the members of that class, chapter, unit or grouping.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided in subsection (j) of this section, a director may be removed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section only if the number of votes cast to remove the director would be sufficient to elect the director at a meeting to elect directors.</p>
                  <p>(d) If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes, or if the director was elected by a class, chapter, unit or grouping of members, the number of votes of that class, chapter, unit or grouping, sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the director's removal.</p>
                  <p>(e) A director elected by members may be removed by the members only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing the director and the meeting notice shall state that the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director.</p>
                  <p>(f) In computing whether a director is protected from removal under subsections (b) through (d) of this section, it should be assumed that the votes against removal are cast in an election for the number of directors of the class to which the director to be removed belonged on the date of that director's election.</p>
                  <p>(g) An entire board of directors may be removed under subsections (a) through (e) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) A director elected by the board may be removed without cause by the vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then in office or any greater number as is set forth in the articles or bylaws; provided, however, that a director elected by the board to fill the vacancy of a director elected by the members may be removed without cause by the members, but not by the board.</p>
                  <p>(j) If, at the beginning of a director's term on the board, the articles or bylaws provide that the director may be removed for missing a specified number of board meetings, the board may remove the director for failing to attend the specified number of meetings. The director may be removed only if a majority of the directors then in office vote for the removal.</p>
                  <p>(k) The articles or bylaws of a religious corporation may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Limit the application of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Set forth the vote and procedures by which the board or any person may remove with or without cause a director elected by the members or the board.</p>

                  <p>(i) The director engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct, or gross abuse of authority or discretion, with respect to the corporation, or a final judgment has been entered finding that the director has violated a duty set forth in W.S. 17-19-830 through 17-19-832; and</p>

                  <p>(a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable if the transaction was fair at the time it was entered into or is approved as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) A transaction in which a director of a public benefit or religious corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved:</p>
                  <p>(i) In advance by the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board if:</p>
                  <p>(A) The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest are disclosed or known to the board or committee of the board; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The directors approving the transaction in good faith reasonably believe that the transaction is fair to the corporation; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Before or after it is consummated by obtaining approval of the:</p>
                  <p>(A) Attorney general; or</p>
                  <p>(B) District court in an action in which the attorney general is joined as a party.</p>
                  <p>(c) A transaction in which a director of a mutual benefit corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board and the board or committee of the board authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction.</p>
                  <p>(d) For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Another entity in which the director has a material interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Another entity of which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction.</p>
                  <p>(e) For purposes of subsections (b) and (c) of this section a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified, if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board or on the committee, who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction shall not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors on the board who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under paragraph (b)(i) or (c)(i) of this section if the transaction is otherwise approved as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) For purposes of paragraph (c)(ii) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by the members if it receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and votes cast by or voted under the control of an entity described in paragraph (d)(i) of this section, shall not be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under paragraph (c)(ii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>The vote of these members, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this act. A majority of the voting power, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) The articles, bylaws or a resolution of the board may impose additional requirements on conflict of interest transactions.</p>

                  <p>(i) In good faith;</p>
                  <p>(ii) With the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and</p>

                  <p>(b) In discharging his duties an officer who is an employee of the corporation is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:</p>
                  <p>(i) One (1) or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;</p>

                  <p>(c) An officer who is an employee of the corporation is not acting in good faith if the officer has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection (b) of this section unwarranted.</p>
                  <p>(d) An officer who is an employee of the corporation is not liable to the corporation, any member or other person for any action taken or not taken as an officer, if the officer acted in compliance with this section.</p>

Reinstatement may be denied by the secretary of state if the corporation has been the subject of secretary of state and law enforcement investigation pertaining to fraud or any other violation of state or federal law, or if there is other reason to believe the corporation was engaged in illegal operations. The application shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of its administrative dissolution;</p>
                  <p>(ii) State that the ground or grounds for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated;</p>

                  <p>(iv) If the corporation was administratively dissolved for failing to deliver its annual report or pay the annual license taxes to the secretary of state when due pursuant to W.S. 17-19-1630, include payment of fees and taxes then delinquent and the reinstatement certificate fee prescribed by W.S. 17-19-122; and</p>
                  <p>(v) If the corporation was administratively dissolved for failure to maintain a registered agent, include payment of a one hundred fifty dollar ($150.00) reinstatement fee and payment of any fees and taxes then delinquent.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the secretary of state determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (a) of this section and that the information is correct, the secretary of state shall cancel the certificate of dissolution and prepare a certificate of reinstatement reciting that determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original of the certificate, and serve a copy on the corporation under W.S. 17-28-104.</p>
                  <p>(c) When reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the corporation shall resume carrying on its activities as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred.</p>

                  <p>(iv) The address of the principal office of the corporation;</p>
                  <p>(v) The address of the proposed registered office of the corporation in this state and the name of its proposed registered agent in this state at the address;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The purpose or purposes of the corporation which it proposes to pursue in the transaction of business in this state;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The names and respective addresses of the directors and officers of the corporation;</p>
                  <p>(viii) A statement of whether it is a public benefit corporation, a mutual benefit corporation or a religious corporation;</p>
                  <p>(ix) A statement whether the corporation has members;</p>
                  <p>(x) A statement that the corporation accepts the constitution of this state in compliance with the requirements of article 10, section 5 of the Wyoming constitution;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Any additional information necessary or appropriate to enable the secretary of state to determine whether the corporation is entitled to a certificate of registration evidencing its authority to transact its affairs and business in the state; and</p>
                  <p>(xii) Any additional information permitted in articles of incorporation under W.S. 17-19-202.</p>
                  <p>(d) The application shall be executed by the corporation by its president or other officer, director, trustee, manager or person performing functions equivalent to those of a president and who is authorized to execute the application on behalf of the corporation and shall be verified by the officer signing the application.</p>
                  <p>(e) The provisions of the articles of continuance may, without expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the corporation's articles of incorporation or equivalent basic corporate charter or other authorization, if the variation is one which a corporation incorporated under this act could effect by way of amendment to its articles of incorporation. Upon issuance of a certificate of continuance by the secretary of state, the articles of continuance shall be deemed to be the articles of incorporation of the continued corporation. The corporation may elect to incorporate by reference in the articles of continuance its basic corporate charter or other authorization which had been adopted by the corporation in the foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the same to continue to act as the articles of incorporation of the corporation, provided, however, that such basic corporate charter or other authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make the same conform to the laws of Wyoming and to the provisions of the articles of continuance.</p>
                  <p>(f) Except for the purpose of W.S. 16-6-101 through 16-6-118, the existence of any corporation heretofore or hereafter issued a certificate of continuance under this act shall be deemed to have commenced on the date the corporation commenced its existence in the jurisdiction in which the corporation was first formed, incorporated or otherwise came into being. The laws of Wyoming shall apply to a corporation continuing under this act to the same extent as if the corporation had been incorporated under the laws of Wyoming from and after the issuance of a certificate of continuance under this act by the secretary of state to the corporation. When a foreign corporation is continued as a corporation under this act, such continuance shall not affect the corporation's ownership of its property or liability for any existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened prosecutions or civil or administrative actions, convictions, rulings, orders, judgments or any other characteristics or aspects of the corporation and its existence.</p>
                  <p>(g) A membership issued before the corporation's continuance in Wyoming is deemed to have been issued in compliance with this act and the provisions of the articles of continuance. Continuance under this act does not deprive a member of any right or privilege that he claims under, or relieve the member of any liability in respect of, an issued membership.</p>
                  <p>(h) As used in this section, the term "corporation" shall include any incorporated organization, foundation, trust, association or similar entity which appears to the secretary of state to possess characteristics sufficiently similar to those of a corporation organized under this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) A statement may be filed in the office of the secretary of state. A certified copy of a statement that is filed in an office in another state may be filed in the office of the secretary of state. Either filing has the effect provided in this chapter with respect to partnership property located in or transactions that occur in this state. If a statement of partnership authority is filed with the secretary of state under W.S. 17-21-303, all statements provided for under this chapter subsequent to the filing of this statement shall be filed with the secretary of state in accordance with this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(b) A certified copy of a statement that has been filed in the office of the secretary of state that is recorded in the office for recording transfers of real property shall have the effect provided for recorded statements in this chapter. A recorded statement that is not a certified copy of a statement filed in the office of the secretary of state shall not have the effect provided for recorded statements in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(c) A statement filed by a partnership must be executed by at least two (2) partners. Other statements must be executed by a partner or other person authorized by this chapter.

                  <p>(d) A person authorized by this chapter to file a statement may amend or cancel the statement by filing an amendment or cancellation that names the partnership, identifies the statement and states the substance of the amendment or cancellation.</p>
                  <p>(e) A person who files a statement pursuant to this section shall promptly send a copy of the statement to every partner and to any other person named as a partner in the statement. Failure to send a copy of a statement to a partner or other person does not limit the effectiveness of the statement as to a person not a partner.</p>
                  <p>(f) The secretary of state shall collect a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for filing or providing a certified copy of a statement. The appropriate county clerk shall collect a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for recording a statement.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the association of two (2) or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit creates a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to create a partnership.</p>
                  <p>(b) An association created under a statute other than this chapter, any predecessor law or comparable law of another jurisdiction is not a partnership.</p>
                  <p>(c) In determining whether a partnership is created, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that the person is a partner in the business, but that inference may not be drawn if the profits were received in payment:</p>
                  <p>(A) Of a debt by installments or otherwise;</p>
                  <p>(B) For services as an independent contractor or of wages or other compensation to an employee;</p>
                  <p>(C) Of rent;</p>
                  <p>(D) Of an annuity or other retirement or health benefit to a beneficiary, representative or designee of a deceased or retired partner;</p>
                  <p>(E) Of interest or other charge on a loan, even if the amount of payment varies with the profits of the business, including a direct or indirect present or future ownership of the collateral or rights to income, proceeds or increase in value derived from the collateral; or</p>
                  <p>(F) Of consideration for the sale of the goodwill of a business or other property by installments or otherwise.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as provided by W.S. 17-21-308, persons who are not partners as to each other are not partners as to other persons.</p>
                  <p>(e) A partnership created under this chapter is a general partnership and the partners are general partners of the partnership.</p>

                  <p>(ii) In the name of one (1) or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(b) Property is acquired in the name of the partnership by a transfer to:</p>
                  <p>(i) The partnership in its name; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) One (1) or more partners in their capacity as partners in the partnership, if the name of the partnership is indicated in the instrument transferring title to the property.</p>
                  <p>(c) Property is presumed to be partnership property if purchased with partnership assets, even if not acquired in the name of the partnership or of one (1) or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership.</p>
                  <p>(d) Property acquired in the name of one (1) or more of the partners, without an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership and without use of partnership assets, is presumed to be separate property even if used for partnership purposes.</p>

                  <p>(i) Each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business. Any act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument in the partnership name, for apparently carrying on in the usual way the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner has no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner is dealing knows or has received a notice that the partner lacks authority;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An act of a partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the usual way the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the other partners.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority pursuant to W.S. 17-21-303:</p>
                  <p>(i) Partnership property held in the name of the partnership may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by any partner in the partnership name;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Partnership property held in the name of one (1) or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A partnership may recover property transferred under this subsection if it proves that execution of the instrument of transfer did not bind the partnership under W.S. 17-21-301, unless the property was transferred by the initial transferee or a person claiming through the initial transferee to a subsequent transferee who gave value without having notice that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(b) Partnership property held in the name of one (1) or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred free of any claims of the partnership or the partners by the persons in whose name the property is held to a transferee who gives value without having notice that it is partnership property.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a person holds all of the partners' interests in the partnership, all of the partnership property vests in that person. That person may execute documents in the name of the partnership to evidence vesting of the property in that person and may file or record those documents.</p>

                  <p>(a) A partnership may file a statement of partnership authority, which:</p>
                  <p>(i) Shall include:</p>
                  <p>(A) The name of the partnership;</p>
                  <p>(B) The street address of its chief executive office and of an office in this state, if any;</p>
                  <p>(C) The names and mailing addresses of all the partners or of an agent appointed and maintained by the partnership for the purpose of subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(D) A statement specifying the names of the partners authorized to execute an instrument transferring real property held in the name of the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(ii) May include a statement of the authority, or of limitations on the authority, of some or all of the partners to enter into other transactions on behalf of the partnership and any other matter.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a statement of partnership authority names an agent, the agent shall maintain a list of the names and mailing addresses of all of the partners and make it available to any person on request for good cause shown.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a filed statement of partnership authority is executed pursuant to W.S. 17-21-105(c) and states the name of the partnership but does not contain all of the other information required by subsection (a) of this section, the statement nevertheless operates with respect to a person not a partner as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, a filed statement of partnership authority supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed statement of partnership authority is conclusive, in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not then contained in another filed statement. A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed statement of partnership authority recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive, in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property. The recording in the office for recording transfers of that real property of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.</p>
                  <p>(e) A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed statement containing the limitation on authority is recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property.</p>
                  <p>(f) Except as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section and W.S. 17-21-704 and 17-21-806, a person not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed statement.</p>
                  <p>(g) Unless earlier canceled, a filed statement of partnership authority is canceled by operation of law five (5) years after the date on which the statement or the most recent amendment was filed with the secretary of state.</p>

                  <p>(b) Except as provided by subsections (c) and (d) of this section, a partner of a registered limited liability partnership is not liable, directly or indirectly (including by way of indemnification, contribution, assessment or otherwise), for any debts, obligations or liabilities of, or chargeable to, the registered limited liability partnership or another partner or partners, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, solely by reason of being such a partner or acting (or omitting to act) in such capacity or otherwise participating (as an employee, consultant, contractor or otherwise) in the conduct of the other business or activities of the registered limited liability partnership, while the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subsection (b) of this section shall not affect the liability of a partner in a registered limited liability partnership for the partner's own negligent or wrongful act or misconduct, or that of any person under the partner's direct supervision and control.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, all or specified partners of a registered limited liability partnership may be liable in their capacity as partners for all or specified debts, obligations or liabilities of a registered limited liability partnership to the extent at least a majority of the partners shall have agreed unless otherwise provided in any agreement between the partners. Any such agreement may be modified or revoked to the extent at least a majority of the partners shall have agreed, unless otherwise provided in any agreement between the partners, provided, however, that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any such modification or revocation shall not affect the liability of a partner for any debts, obligations or liabilities of a registered limited liability partnership incurred, created or assumed by the registered limited liability partnership prior to the modification or revocation; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) A partner shall be liable for debts, obligations and liabilities of the registered limited liability partnership incurred, created or assumed after such modification or revocation only in accordance with this article and, if the agreement is further modified, the agreement as so further modified but only to the extent not inconsistent with subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in this section shall in any way affect or impair the ability of a partner to act as a guarantor or surety for, provide collateral for, or otherwise be liable for, the debts, obligations or liabilities of a registered limited liability partnership.</p>

                  <p>(B) An involuntary case under title 11 of the United States Code has been commenced against the partnership and has not been dismissed within sixty (60) days after commencement or the partnership has commenced a voluntary case under title 11 of the United States Code and the case has not been dismissed;</p>
                  <p>(C) The partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust partnership assets;</p>
                  <p>(D) A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy execution against the assets of a partner based on a finding that partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of partnership assets is excessively burdensome or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court's equitable powers; or</p>
                  <p>(E) Liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(e) This section applies to any partnership liability or obligation resulting from a representation by a partner or purported partner under W.S. 17-21-308(a) or (b).</p>

                  <p>(a) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one (1) or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made:</p>
                  <p>(i) If that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the purported partner would have been personally liable for obligations of the partnership under W.S. 17-21-306 if he actually had been a partner.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to subsection (a) of this section if the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner's consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a person is thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership or with one (1) or more persons not partners, the purported partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable as provided in W.S. 17-21-306 as if the person actually had been a partner.</p>
                  <p>(d) A person is not a partner in a partnership solely because the person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority.</p>
                  <p>(e) A person does not continue to be a partner solely because of a failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of partnership authority to indicate the partner's dissociation from the partnership.</p>

                  <p>(c) A partnership shall indemnify each partner for payments reasonably made and liabilities reasonably incurred by the partner in the ordinary and proper conduct of the business of the partnership or for the preservation of its business or property, provided, however, that no other partner shall be required to make any payment to the partnership or any other partner, except as provided to the partnership or any other partner, except as provided in W.S. 17-21-807 and 17-21-808, including any payments attributable all or in part to partnership liabilities for indemnification.</p>
                  <p>(d) A partnership shall repay a partner who, in aid of the partnership, makes a payment or advance beyond the amount of capital the partner agreed to contribute.</p>
                  <p>(e) A payment made by a partner which gives rise to a partnership obligation under subsection (c) or (d) of this section constitutes a loan to the partnership. Interest accrues from the date of the payment or advance.</p>

                  <p>(a) The only fiduciary duties a partner owes to the partnership and the other partners are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care set forth in this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) A partner's duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other partners is limited to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) To account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the partner, without the consent of the other partners, in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or from a use or appropriation by the partner of partnership property or opportunity;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business, as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership without the consent of the other partners; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) To refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business without the consent of the other partners before the dissolution of the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(c) A partner's duty of loyalty may not be eliminated by agreement, but the partners may by agreement identify specific types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty, if not manifestly unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>(d) A partner's duty of care to the partnership and the other partners in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.</p>
                  <p>(e) A partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and the other partners under this chapter or under the partnership agreement, and exercise any rights, consistent with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The obligation of good faith and fair dealing may not be eliminated by agreement but the partners may by agreement determine the standards by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured, if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>(f) A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely because the partner's conduct furthers the partner's own interest. A partner may lend money to and transact other business with the partnership. The rights and obligations of a partner who lends money to or transacts business with the partnership are the same as those of a person who is not a partner, subject to other applicable law.</p>
                  <p>(g) This section applies to a person winding up the partnership business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving partner as if the person were a partner.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Enforce a right under this chapter, including:</p>
                  <p>(A) The partner's rights under W.S. 17-21-401, 17-21-403 and 17-21-404;</p>
                  <p>(B) The partner's right on dissociation to have the partner's interest in the partnership purchased pursuant to W.S. 17-21-701 or enforce any other right under article 6 or 7 of this chapter; or</p>
                  <p>(C) The partner's right to compel a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under W.S. 17-21-801 or enforce any other right under article 8 of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Enforce the rights and otherwise protect the interests of the partner, including rights and interests arising independently of the partnership relationship.</p>
                  <p>(c) The accrual of and any time limitation on a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law.</p>

                  <p>(a) A transfer, in whole or in part, of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is permissible;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Does not by itself cause a winding up of the partnership business; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Does not, as against the other partners or the partnership, entitle the transferee, during the continuance of the partnership, to participate in the management or conduct of the partnership business, to require access to information concerning or an account of partnership transactions or to inspect or copy the partnership books or records.</p>
                  <p>(b) A transferee of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership is entitled to receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled.

                  <p>(a) On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or partner's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the transferable interest of the debtor partner or transferee to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the debtor's share of the distributions due or to become due to the debtor in respect of the partnership and make all other orders, directions, accounts and inquiries the debtor might have made or which the circumstances of the case may require.</p>
                  <p>(b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's transferable interest in the partnership. The court may order a foreclosure of the interest subject to the charging order at any time and upon conditions it considers appropriate. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.</p>
                  <p>(c) At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be redeemed:</p>
                  <p>(i) By the judgment debtor;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-21-701. Purchase of dissociated partner's interest.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under W.S. 17-21-801, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner's interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subsection</p>
                  <p>(b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The buyout price of a dissociated partner's interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under W.S. 17-21-808(b) if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership were wound up as of that date. In either case, the sale price of the partnership assets shall be determined on the basis of the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell, and with knowledge of all relevant facts. Interest shall be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) Damages for wrongful dissociation under W.S. 17-21-602(b) and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, shall be offset against the buyout price. Interest shall be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.</p>
                  <p>(d) A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner against all partnership liabilities incurred before the dissociation, except liabilities then unknown to the partnership, and against all partnership liabilities incurred after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under W.S. 17-21-702. For purposes of this subsection, a liability not known to a partner other than the dissociated partner is not known to the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(e) If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner's interest is reached within one hundred twenty (120) days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay or cause to be paid in cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection</p>
                  <p>(h) of this section, the partnership may tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection (c) of this section, stating the time of payment, the amount and type of security for payment and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.</p>
                  <p>(g) The payment or tender required by subsection (e) or</p>
                  <p>(f) of this section shall be accompanied by the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) A statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection (c) of this section or other terms of the purchase obligation.</p>
                  <p>(h) A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment shall be adequately secured and bear interest.</p>
                  <p>(j) A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership pursuant to W.S. 17-21-406(b)(ii)(B), to determine the buyout price of that partner's interest, any offsets under subsection (c) of this section or other terms of the purchase obligation. The action shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one (1) year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner's interest, any offset due under subsection (c) of this section and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h) of this section, the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against any other party, if the court finds that the other party acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith, including the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with the requirements of subsection</p>

                  <p>(a) For two (2) years after a partner dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, the partnership, including a surviving partnership under article 9 of this chapter, is bound by an act of the dissociated partner that would have bound the partnership under W.S. 17-21-301 before dissociation only if the other party to the transaction:</p>
                  <p>(i) Reasonably believes when entering the transaction that the dissociated partner is a partner at that time;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Does not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Is not deemed to have notice under W.S. 17-21-303(e) or 17-21-704.</p>

                  <p>(a) A partner's dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner's liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is personally liable as a partner to the other party on account of a partnership obligation incurred in connection with a transaction entered into by the partnership or a surviving partnership under article 9 of this chapter, within two (2) years after the partner's dissociation, only if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The other party to the transaction:</p>
                  <p>(A) Reasonably believes when entering the transaction that the dissociated partner is a partner at that time;</p>
                  <p>(B) Does not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and</p>

                  <p>(ii) The obligation is one on account of which the partner would be personally liable under W.S. 17-21-306 if the partner had not dissociated.</p>
                  <p>(c) By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.</p>
                  <p>(d) A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a partnership of more than two (2) persons is not dissolved until ninety (90) days after receipt by the partnership of notice from a partner under W.S. 17-21-801(a)(i) or (ii)(A) and its business may be continued until that date as if no notice were received. Before that date, the partner who gave the notice may waive the right to have the partnership business wound up.

                  <p>(b) A statement of dissolution cancels a filed statement of partnership authority for the purposes of W.S. 17-21-303(d) and is a limitation on authority for the purposes of W.S. 17-21-303(e).</p>
                  <p>(c) For purposes of W.S. 17-21-301 and 17-21-805, a person not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissolution and the limitation on the partners' authority as a result of the statement of dissolution ninety (90) days after it is filed.</p>

                  <p>(a) In winding up the partnership business, the assets of the partnership shall be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including partners who are creditors. Any surplus shall be applied to pay in cash the net amount distributable to partners in accordance with their right to distributions pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each partner is entitled to a settlement of all partnership accounts upon winding up the partnership business. In settling accounts among the partners, the profits and losses that result from the liquidation of the partnership assets shall be credited and charged to the partners' accounts. The partnership shall make a distribution to a partner in an amount equal to that partner's positive balance. A partner shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to that partner's negative balance only to the extent that negative balance is attributable to an obligation for which that partner is personally liable under W.S. 17-21-306.</p>
                  <p>(c) To the extent not taken into account in settling the accounts among partners pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, each partner shall contribute in the proportion in which the partner shares partnership losses, the amount necessary to satisfy those partnership obligations for which the partner is personally liable under W.S. 17-21-306. If a partner fails or is not obligated to contribute, the other partners shall contribute in the proportions in which the partners share partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy those partnership obligations for which the partners are personally liable under W.S. 17-21-306. A partner or partner's legal representative may recover from the other partners any contributions the partner makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner's share of the partnership obligations but only to the extent such contributions are made on account of obligations for which the other partners are liable under W.S. 17-21-306.</p>
                  <p>(d) The estate of a deceased partner is liable for the partner's obligation to contribute to the partnership under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a partnership or a partner or a person appointed by the court to represent creditors of a partnership or a partner, may enforce a partner's obligation to contribute to the partnership under subsection (b) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(b) The terms and conditions of a conversion of a partnership to a limited partnership shall be approved by all the partners or by a number or percentage specified for conversion in the partnership agreement.</p>
                  <p>(c) After the conversion is approved by the partners, the partnership shall file a certificate of limited partnership which satisfies the requirements of W.S. 17-14-301 and includes:</p>
                  <p>(i) A statement that the partnership was converted to a limited partnership from a partnership;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Its former name; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) A statement of the number of votes cast by the partners for and against the conversion and if the vote is less than unanimous, the number or percentage required to approve the conversion under the partnership agreement.</p>

                  <p>(e) A partner who becomes a limited partner as a result of the conversion remains liable as a partner for an obligation incurred by the partnership before the conversion takes effect for which the partner is personally liable under W.S. 17-21-306, 17-21-807 and 17-21-808. If the other party to a transaction with the limited partnership reasonably believes when entering the transaction that the limited partner is a general partner, the partner is liable for an obligation incurred by the limited partnership within ninety (90) days after the conversion takes effect for which a general partner would be personally liable under W.S. 17-21-306, 17-21-807 and 17-21-808. The partner's liability for all other obligations of the limited partnership incurred after the conversion takes effect is that of a limited partner as provided in the Uniform Limited Partnership Act.</p>

                  <p>(e) A partner of a party to a merger who does not become a partner of the surviving partnership or limited partnership is dissociated from the entity, of which that partner was a partner, as of the date the merger takes effect. The surviving entity shall cause the partner's interest in the entity to be purchased under W.S. 17-21-701. The surviving entity is bound under W.S. 17-21-702 by an act of a partner dissociated under this subsection and the partner is liable under W.S. 17-21-703 for transactions entered into by the surviving entity after the merger takes effect.</p>

                  <p>(a) To become a registered limited liability partnership, a partnership shall file with the office of the secretary of state a statement of registration as a registered limited liability partnership. The statement of registration shall state:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name of the partnership;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The address of its principal office and the name of the registered agent for service of process in this state at such address which, if in this state, shall be its registered office for service of process;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the partnership's principal office is not located in this state, the address of a registered office and the name and address of a registered agent for service of process in this state, which the partnership will be required to maintain;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A brief statement of the business in which the partnership engages;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any other matters that the partnership determines to include; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) That the partnership thereby registers as a registered limited liability partnership.</p>
                  <p>(b) The statement of registration shall be executed by one (1) or more partners authorized to execute a statement of registration. The statement of registration shall be accompanied by a written consent to appointment manually signed by the registered agent.</p>
                  <p>(c) Repealed By Laws 2000, Ch. 35, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(d) The secretary of state shall register as a registered limited liability partnership any partnership that submits a statement of registration that substantially complies with this section and the required fee.</p>
                  <p>(e) Repealed By Laws 2000, Ch. 35, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(f) Registration is effective immediately upon the filing of a statement of registration or at any later date or time specified in the statement of registration, and remains effective until:</p>
                  <p>(i) It is voluntarily withdrawn by filing with the office of the secretary of state a written statement of withdrawal executed by one (1) or more partners authorized to execute a statement of withdrawal; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Sixty (60) days after notice by the secretary of state that the partnership has failed to make timely payment of the annual fee specified in subsection (n) of this section or has failed to pay any penalties imposed under W.S. 17-28-109, unless the fee and any penalties are paid within the sixty (60) day period, or that the partnership is without a registered agent or registered office in this state, unless the partnership regains a registered agent or registered office in this state during the sixty (60) day period. The secretary of state shall mail such notice by first class mail to the last known mailing address of the partnership or by electronic means if the partnership has consented to receive notices electronically. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph, any domestic registered limited liability partnership whose statement of registration has lapsed under this paragraph may be reinstated as provided in W.S. 17-21-1107.</p>
                  <p>(g) A registered limited liability partnership registered under this chapter ceases to be a registered limited liability partnership upon filing with the office of the secretary of state a statement of withdrawal as a registered limited liability partnership, which shall set forth:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name of the registered limited liability partnership;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The date of filing of the initial statement of registration;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The reason for filing the statement of withdrawal;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The effective date (which shall be a date certain) of withdrawal if it is not to be effective on the filing of the statement of withdrawal, provided that any effective date other than the date of filing of the statement of withdrawal shall be a date subsequent to the filing; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Any other information the partners determine to include therein.</p>
                  <p>(h) The filing of a statement of withdrawal by or on behalf of a partnership pursuant to this section shall be effective only to cancel the partnership's registration as a limited liability partnership, and shall not, unless it specifically so provides, indicate the dissolution of the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(j) A partnership becomes a registered limited liability partnership at the time of the filing of the initial statement of registration with the office of the secretary of state or at any later date or time specified in the statement of registration if, in either case, there has been substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter. A partnership continues as a registered limited liability partnership if there has been substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The status of a partnership as a registered limited liability partnership and the liability of a partner of such registered limited liability partnership shall not be affected by errors or subsequent changes in the information stated in a statement of registration under subsection (a) of this section or a statement of renewal under subsection (e) of this section. The filing of a statement of withdrawal shall not affect the liability of the partners for debts, obligations or liabilities of the partnership incurred, assumed or arising prior to the date of the statement of withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>(k) The fact that a statement of registration or a statement of renewal is on file with the office of the secretary of state is notice that the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership and is notice of all other facts set forth in the statement of registration or statement of renewal.</p>
                  <p>(m) The secretary of state shall provide forms for a statement of registration under subsection (a) of this section or a statement of renewal.</p>
                  <p>(n) An initial registration fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be paid to the secretary of state. In addition each registered limited liability partnership and foreign limited liability partnership shall annually comply with and pay the fees provided by W.S. 17-16-1630(a) through (e) and 17-16-120(j) as if it were a corporation. Any registered foreign limited liability partnership transacting business in this state without registering or annually maintaining its registration is subject to the penalties provided by W.S. 17-16-1502(d).</p>
                  <p>(o) The provisions of W.S. 17-28-101 through 17-28-111 shall apply to all registered limited liability partnerships.</p>

                  <p>(a) A partnership that has registered pursuant to this article is for all purposes of the laws of this state the same entity that existed before the registration.</p>
                  <p>(b) When registration takes effect:</p>
                  <p>(i) All property owned by the registering partnership remains vested in the registered partnership;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All obligations of the registering partnership continue as obligations of the registered partnership; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) An action or proceeding pending against the registering partnership may be continued as if the registration had not occurred.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership dissolves and its business continues without winding up the partnership affairs and without liquidating or terminating the partnership, the registration of the registered limited liability partnership or the foreign registered limited liability partnership shall continue to be applicable to the partnership continuing the business, and the partnership shall not be required to file a new statement of registration or statement of renewal. The partnership continuing the business shall be deemed to have filed any documents required or permitted under this section which were filed by the dissolved partnership. The partnership continuing the business shall file a statement of renewal at such time as the dissolved partnership would have been required to file a statement of renewal.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a registered limited liability partnership or foreign registered limited liability partnership dissolves and winds up its affairs, liquidates or terminates, the statement of registration or statement of renewal remains in effect as to the partnership and the partners during the period of winding up, and as to the partners subsequent to liquidation or termination as to liabilities of the partnership incurred, assumed or arising prior to liquidation or termination.</p>

                  <p>(a) A partnership, including a registered limited liability partnership, formed pursuant to an agreement governed by this chapter, may conduct its business, carry on its operations and have and exercise the powers granted by this chapter in any state, territory, district or possession of the United States or in any foreign country.</p>
                  <p>(b) It is the intent of the legislature that the legal existence of registered limited liability partnerships formed pursuant to an agreement governed by this chapter be recognized outside the boundaries of this state and that the laws of this state governing such registered limited liability partnerships transacting business outside this state be granted the protection of full faith and credit under the constitution of the United States.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding W.S. 17-21-106, the internal affairs of registered limited liability partnerships, including the liability of partners for debts, obligations and liabilities of or chargeable to the partnership or another partner or partners and the liability of partners to the partnership and other partners, shall be subject to and governed by the laws of this state.</p>
                  <p>(d) Before transacting business in this state, a foreign registered limited liability partnership shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Comply with any statutory or administrative registration or filing requirements governing the specific type of business in which the partnership is engaged; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) File a statement of registration as a foreign registered limited liability partnership with the office of the secretary of state, on such forms as the secretary shall provide, stating:</p>
                  <p>(A) The name of the partnership;</p>
                  <p>(B) The jurisdiction under the laws of which govern its partnership agreement and under which it is registered as a limited liability partnership;</p>
                  <p>(C) The address of its principal office which, if in this state, shall be its registered office for service of process;</p>
                  <p>(D) If the partnership's principal office is not located in this state, the address of a registered office and the name and address of a registered agent for service of process in this state, which the partnership will be required to maintain;</p>
                  <p>(E) A brief statement of the business in which the partnership engages;</p>
                  <p>(F) Any other information that the partnership determines to include; and</p>
                  <p>(G) A statement that the partnership is a registered limited liability partnership.</p>
                  <p>(e) Repealed By Laws 2000, Ch. 35, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(f) A foreign registered limited liability partnership registered to transact business in this state may withdraw its registration as a foreign registered limited liability partnership by filing with the office of the secretary of state a statement of withdrawal as a foreign registered limited liability partnership, which shall set forth:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name of the foreign registered limited liability partnership and the state or other jurisdiction under whose jurisdiction it is or was registered as a registered limited liability partnership;</p>
                  <p>(ii) That the foreign registered limited liability partnership is not transacting business in this state and that it surrenders its registration to transact business in this state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) That the foreign registered limited liability partnership revokes the authority of its registered agent in this state to accept service of process and appoints the secretary of state as its agent for service of process in any action, suit or proceeding based upon any cause of action arising during the time the foreign registered limited liability partnership was registered to transact business in this state; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) A mailing address to which the secretary of state may mail a copy of any process served on him in his capacity as agent for such registered limited liability partnership.</p>
                  <p>(g) The failure of a foreign registered limited liability partnership to file a statement of registration or a statement of renewal pursuant to W.S. 17-21-1101 or to appoint and maintain a registered agent in this state shall not affect the liability of the partners or impair the validity of any contract or act of the foreign registered limited liability partnership and shall not prevent the foreign registered limited liability partnership from defending any action or proceeding in any court of this state, but the foreign registered limited liability partnership shall not maintain any action or proceeding in any court of this state until it has filed a statement of registration. A foreign registered limited liability partnership, by transacting business in this state without registration, appoints the secretary of state as its agent for service of process with respect to causes of action arising out of the transaction of business in this state.</p>
                  <p>(h) The name of a foreign registered limited liability partnership doing business in this state shall not be the same as or deceptively similar to any trademark or service mark registered in this state and shall be distinguishable upon the records of the secretary of state from other business names filed with that office. A foreign limited liability partnership must use a name which satisfies the requirements of the state or other jurisdiction under whose law it is formed and ends with "Registered Limited Liability Partnership", "Limited Liability Partnership", "R.L.L.P.", "L.L.P.", "RLLP", or "LLP".</p>
                  <p>(j) The laws under which a foreign limited liability partnership is formed govern relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership and the liability of partners for obligations of the partnership.</p>
                  <p>(k) The authorization granted by the secretary of state to file a statement of registration under a foreign registered limited liability partnership name does not:</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-23-104. Contributions by beneficial owners.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A contribution of a beneficial owner to the statutory trust may be in cash, property or services rendered, or a promissory note or other obligation to contribute cash or property or to perform services. A person may become a beneficial owner of a statutory trust and may receive a beneficial interest in a statutory trust without making a contribution or being obligated to make a contribution to the statutory trust.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as provided in the governing instrument, a beneficial owner is obligated to the statutory trust to perform any promise to contribute cash, property or to perform services, even if the beneficial owner is unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a beneficial owner does not make the required contribution of property or services, the beneficial owner is obligated at the option of the statutory trust to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value, as stated in the records of the statutory trust, of the contribution that has not been made. The cash contribution shall be in addition to any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the statutory trust may have against the beneficial owner under the governing instrument or applicable law.</p>
                  <p>(c) A governing instrument may provide that the interest of any beneficial owner who fails to make any contribution that he is obligated to make shall be subject to specific penalties or consequences for the failure. The penalty or consequence may take the form of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Reducing or eliminating the defaulting beneficial owner's proportionate interest in the statutory trust;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subordinating his beneficial interest to that of nondefaulting beneficial owners;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A forced sale of his beneficial interest;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Forfeiture of his beneficial interest;</p>
                  <p>(v) The lending by other beneficial owners of the amount necessary to meet his commitment;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Fixing of the value of his beneficial interest by appraisal or by formula and redemption or sale of his beneficial interest at that value; or</p>
                  <p>(vii) Any other penalty or consequence.</p>

                  <p>(b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a trustee, when acting in that capacity, shall not be personally liable to any persons other than the statutory trust or a beneficial owner for any act, omission or obligation of the statutory trust or any trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of W.S. 17-23-113, trustees of a statutory trust shall not be held to a more rigorous standard of care than that imposed upon directors of a business corporation under the Wyoming Business Corporation Act.</p>

                  <p>(a) A statutory trust may sue and be sued in its own name, and service of process upon any one (1) of the trustees or upon the registered agent shall be sufficient. A statutory trust may be sued for debts and other obligations or liabilities contracted or incurred by the trustees, or by the duly authorized agents of the trustees, in the performance of their respective duties under the governing instrument of the statutory trust, and for any damages to persons or property resulting from the negligence of the trustees or agents acting in the performance of their respective duties. The property of a statutory trust shall be subject to attachment and execution pursuant to the Wyoming Code of Civil Procedure, as if it were a corporation.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, in the event that the governing instrument of a statutory trust which is a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, creates one (1) or more series as provided in W.S. 17-23-108(b)(ii), the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series shall be enforceable against the assets of that series only, and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Separate and distinct records are maintained for the series;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The assets associated with the series are held and accounted for separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or any other series of that trust; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The governing instrument so provides, and notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this subsection is set forth in the certificate of trust of the statutory trust.</p>
                  <p>(c) A trustee of a statutory trust may be served with process in the manner prescribed in subsection (d) of this section in all civil actions or proceedings brought in this state involving or relating to the activities of the statutory trust or a violation by a trustee of a duty to the statutory trust, or any beneficial owner, whether or not the trustee is a trustee at the time suit is commenced. Every resident or nonresident of the state who accepts election or appointment or serves as a trustee of a statutory trust shall, by the acceptance or service, have consented to the appointment of the registered agent of the statutory trust required by W.S. 17-23-109 as that person's agent upon whom service of process may be made as provided in this section. Any process served in accordance with this section shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon the trustee within the state and the appointment of the registered agent shall be irrevocable.</p>
                  <p>(d) Service of process shall be effected by serving a Wyoming trustee or registered agent of the statutory trust required by W.S. 17-23-109, with one (1) copy of the process in the manner provided by law for service of process.</p>
                  <p>(e) In the governing instrument or other writing, a trustee may consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or the exclusivity of arbitration in, this state, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in the governing instrument or other writing.</p>
                  <p>(f) Nothing in this section limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner provided by law. This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents.</p>
                  <p>(g) A partnership, limited partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other nonnatural person formed or organized under the laws of any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction or the laws of any state other than the state of Wyoming shall not be deemed to be doing business in the state solely by reason of its being a trustee of a statutory trust.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a beneficial owner shall have an undivided beneficial interest in the property of the statutory trust and shall share in the profits or losses of the statutory trust in the proportion of the entire undivided beneficial interest in the statutory trust he owns. The governing instrument of a statutory trust may provide that the statutory trust or the trustees, acting for and on behalf of the statutory trust, shall be deemed to hold beneficial ownership of any income earned on securities of the statutory trust issued by any business entities formed, organized or existing under the laws of any jurisdiction, including the laws of any foreign country.</p>
                  <p>(b) No creditor of the beneficial owner shall have any right to obtain possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, the property of the statutory trust.</p>
                  <p>(c) A beneficial owner's beneficial interest in the statutory trust is personal property notwithstanding the nature of the property of the trust. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a beneficial owner has no interest in specific statutory trust property.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, the transferee of a beneficial owner's beneficial interest in the statutory trust shall only be entitled to receive the share of profits and the return of contributions to which the beneficial owner otherwise would be entitled. In the absence of the unanimous written consent of the owners of all other beneficial interests and of all trustees of the statutory trust, and except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a transferee of a beneficial owner's beneficial interest shall have no right to participate in, be kept apprised of the affairs of the statutory trust or to become a beneficial owner of a beneficial interest in the statutory trust.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, at the time a beneficial owner becomes entitled to receive a distribution, he has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the statutory trust with respect to the distribution. A governing instrument may provide for the establishment of record dates with respect to allocations and distributions by a statutory trust.</p>

                  <p>(a) The business and affairs of a statutory trust shall be managed by or under the direction of its trustees. To the extent provided in the governing instrument, any person, including a beneficial owner, shall be entitled to direct the trustees in the management of a statutory trust. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, neither the power to give direction to a trustee nor the exercise thereof by any person, including a beneficial owner, shall cause the person to be a trustee.</p>
                  <p>(b) A governing instrument may contain any provision relating to the management of the business and affairs of the statutory trust, and the rights, duties and obligations of the trustees, beneficial owners and other persons, which is not contrary to any provision or requirement of this chapter and, without limitation may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide for classes, groups or series of trustees or beneficial owners, or classes, groups or series of beneficial interests, having the relative rights, powers and duties as the governing instrument may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the governing instrument of additional classes, groups or series of trustees, beneficial owners or beneficial interests, having such relative rights, powers and duties as may be established, including rights, powers and duties senior or subordinate to existing classes, groups or series of trustees, beneficial owners or beneficial interests;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Establish or provide for the establishment of designated series of trustees, beneficial owners or beneficial interests having separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified property or obligations of the statutory trust or profits and losses associated with specified property or obligations, and, to the extent provided in the governing instrument, any designated series may have a separate business purpose or investment objective;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide for the taking of any action, including the amendment of the governing instrument, the accomplishment of a merger or consolidation, the appointment of one (1) or more trustees, the sale, lease, exchange, transfer, pledge or other disposition of all or any part of the assets of the statutory trust or the assets of any series, or the dissolution of the statutory trust, or may provide for the taking of any action to create under the provisions of the governing instrument a class, group or series of beneficial interests that was not previously outstanding, in any such case without the vote of or approval of any particular trustee or beneficial owner, or class, group or series of trustees or beneficial owners;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Grant to, or withhold from, all or certain trustees or beneficial owners, or a specified class, group or series of trustees or beneficial owners, the right to vote, separately or with any other classes, groups or series of the trustees or beneficial owners, on any matter, with voting being on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group series or any other basis;</p>
                  <p>(v) To the extent that voting rights are granted under the governing instrument, set forth provisions relating to notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on, waiver of any notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of record dates, quorum requirements, voting in person, by proxy or in any other manner, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any right to vote;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Provide for the present or future creation of more than one (1) statutory trust, including the creation of a future statutory trust to which all or any part of the assets, liabilities, profits or losses of any existing statutory trust will be transferred, and for the conversion of beneficial interests in an existing statutory trust, or series thereof, into beneficial interests in the separate statutory trust, or series thereof.</p>
                  <p>(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, a trustee has duties, including fiduciary duties, and liabilities relating to a statutory trust or to a beneficial owner:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any trustee acting under a governing instrument shall not be liable to the statutory trust or to any beneficial owner for the trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of the governing instrument; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The trustee's duties and liabilities may be expanded or restricted by provisions in a governing instrument.</p>

Unless the secretary of state finds that any certificate does not conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required he shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Certify that the certificate of trust, the certificate of amendment, the certificate of cancellation or the certificate of merger or consolidation has been filed in his office by endorsing upon the original and duplicate copy of the certificate the word "Filed," and the date and hour of the filing.

                  <p>(a) A beneficial owner may bring an action in the district court in the right of a statutory trust to recover a judgment in its favor if trustees with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those trustees to bring the action is not likely to succeed.</p>
                  <p>(b) In a derivative action, the plaintiff must be a beneficial owner at the time of bringing the action and:</p>
                  <p>(i) At the time of the transaction of which he complains; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) His status as a beneficial owner had devolved upon him by operation of law or pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument of the statutory trust from a person who was a beneficial owner at the time of the transaction.</p>
                  <p>(c) In a derivative action, the complaint shall set forth with particularity the effort, if any, of the plaintiff to secure initiation of the action by the trustees, or the reasons for not making the effort.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a derivative action is successful, in whole or in part, or if anything is received by a statutory trust as a result of a judgment, compromise or settlement of any derivative action, the court may award the plaintiff reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees. If anything is so received by the plaintiff, the court shall make the award of the plaintiff's expenses payable out of those proceeds and direct the plaintiff to remit to the statutory trust the remainder of the proceeds. If those proceeds are insufficient to reimburse the plaintiff's reasonable expenses, the court may direct that any award of plaintiff's expenses or portion thereof be paid by the statutory trust.</p>

                  <p>(a) Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, a statutory trust may merge or consolidate with or into one (1) or more statutory trusts or other business entities formed or organized or existing under the laws of this state or any other state of the United States or any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction, with the statutory trust or other business entity as the agreement provides being the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity. Unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument of a statutory trust, a merger or consolidation shall be approved by all of the trustees and the beneficial owners of each statutory trust which is to merge or consolidate. In connection with a merger or consolidation, rights or securities of, or interests in, a statutory trust or other business entity which is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity or, in addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, a statutory trust or other business entity which is not the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity in the merger or consolidation. Notwithstanding prior approval, an agreement of merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a provision for termination or amendment contained in the agreement of merger or consolidation.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a statutory trust is merging or consolidating under this section, the statutory trust or other business entity surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of merger or consolidation in the office of the secretary of state. The certificate of merger or consolidation shall state:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of each statutory trust or other business entity which is to merge or consolidate;</p>
                  <p>(ii) That an agreement of merger or consolidation has been approved and executed by each statutory trust or other business entity which is to merge or consolidate;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The name of the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The future effective date or time of the merger or consolidation if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger or consolidation;</p>
                  <p>(v) That the executed agreement of merger or consolidation is on file at the principal place of business of the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity, and the address thereof;</p>
                  <p>(vi) That a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be furnished by the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity, on request and without cost, to any beneficial owner of any statutory trust or any person holding an interest in any other business entity which is to merge or consolidate; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) If the surviving or resulting entity is not a statutory trust or other business entity formed or organized or existing under the laws of this state, a statement that the surviving or resulting other business entity agrees that it may be served with process in this state in any action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any obligation of any statutory trust which is to merge or consolidate. The statement shall irrevocably appoint the secretary of state as the agent to accept service of process in any such action, suit or proceeding and specify the address to which a copy of the process shall be mailed by the secretary of state. In the event of service under this paragraph upon the secretary of state, the plaintiff shall furnish the secretary of state with the address specified in the certificate of merger or consolidation provided for in this paragraph and any other address which the plaintiff may elect to furnish, together with copies of the process required by the secretary of state. The secretary of state shall notify the surviving or resulting other business entity at all addresses furnished by the plaintiff by letter, certified mail, return receipt requested. The letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served upon the secretary of state. It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to notify the secretary of state that service is being made pursuant to this paragraph, and to pay the secretary of state the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) for use of the state, which shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding, if the plaintiff shall prevail. The secretary of state shall maintain an alphabetical record of any process under this paragraph setting forth the name of the plaintiff and defendant, the title, docket number and nature of the proceedings in which process has been served upon him, the return date thereof, and the day and hour when the service was made. The secretary of state shall not be required to retain the information for a period longer than five (5) years from his receipt of the service of process.</p>
                  <p>(c) Unless a future effective date or time is provided in a certificate of merger or consolidation, in which event a merger or consolidation shall be effective at the future effective date or time, a merger or consolidation shall be effective upon the filing in the office of the secretary of state of a certificate of merger or consolidation.</p>
                  <p>(d) A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate of cancellation for a statutory trust which is not the surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the governing instrument, a governing instrument containing a specific reference to this subsection may provide that an agreement of merger or consolidation approved in accordance with subsection (a) of this section may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Effect any amendment to the governing instrument of the statutory trust; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Effect the adoption of a new governing instrument of the statutory trust if it is the surviving or resulting statutory trust in the merger or consolidation.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any amendment to the governing instrument of a statutory trust or adoption of a new governing instrument of the statutory trust made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or consolidation. The provisions of subsection (e) of this section and this subsection shall not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a merger or consolidation or of any of the matters referred to in this article by any other means provided for in the governing instrument of a statutory trust or other agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the governing instrument of any constituent statutory trust to the merger or consolidation, including a statutory trust formed for the purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the governing instrument of the surviving or resulting statutory trust.</p>
                  <p>(g) When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the statutory trusts and other business entities that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of those statutory trusts and other business entities, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such statutory trusts and other business entities, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity as they were of each of the statutory trusts and other business entities that have merged or consolidated. The title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the state, in any of merging or consolidating statutory trusts and other business entities, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter. All rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any merging or consolidating statutory trusts and other business entities shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the statutory trusts and other business entities that have merged or consolidated shall attach to the surviving or resulting statutory trust or other business entity, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-23-202. Continuance of foreign statutory trusts.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, any statutory trust created for any purpose except acting as an insurer as defined in W.S. 26-1-102(a)(xvi), or acting as a financial institution as defined by W.S. 13-1-101(a)(ix) or its successor statute, under the laws of any jurisdiction other than this state may, if the jurisdiction will acknowledge the statutory trust's termination of domicile in the foreign jurisdiction, apply to the secretary of state for registration under this chapter, thus continuing the statutory trust in Wyoming as if it had been organized under the laws of this state. The secretary of state may issue a certificate of continuance upon receipt of an application for continuance as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The certificate of continuance may then be issued subject to any limitations and conditions and may contain any provisions as appear proper to the secretary of state.</p>
                  <p>(b) The secretary of state shall cause notice of issuance of a certificate of continuance to be given forthwith to the proper officer of the jurisdiction in which the statutory trust was previously organized.</p>
                  <p>(c) The application for continuance filed by a foreign statutory trust with the secretary of state shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A certified copy of its original certificate of trust and all amendments thereto or its equivalent;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The name of the statutory trust and the jurisdiction under the laws of which it is organized;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The date of organization and the period of duration of the statutory trust;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The address of the principal office of the statutory trust;</p>
                  <p>(v) The street address of the proposed registered office of the statutory trust in this state and the name of its proposed registered agent in this state at the address;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The purpose or purposes of the statutory trust which it proposes to pursue in the transaction of business in this state;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Any information concerning capital structure or financial status the secretary of state deems necessary to establish fees and taxes under the laws of this state;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Any additional information necessary or appropriate to enable the secretary of state to determine whether the statutory trust is entitled to a certificate of organization evidencing its existence and authority to transact business in this state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The application shall be executed by the statutory trust by its trustees or a trustee who is authorized to execute the application on behalf of the statutory trust and shall be verified by the trustee signing the application.</p>
                  <p>(e) The provisions of the application for continuance may without expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the statutory trust's certificate of trust or governing instrument or equivalent, if the variation is one which a statutory trust organized under the Wyoming Statutory Trust Act could effect by way of amendment to its certificate of trust or governing instrument. Upon issuance of a certificate of continuance by the secretary of state, the certificate of continuance shall be the certificate of trust of the continued statutory trust. The statutory trust may elect to incorporate by reference in and attachment to the application for continuance its original certificate of trust or other authorization which had been adopted by the statutory trust in the foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the original to continue to act as the certificate of trust of the statutory trust provided, however, that the original certificate of trust or other authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it conform to the laws of this state.</p>
                  <p>(f) The existence of any statutory trust issued a certificate of continuance under this chapter shall be deemed to have commenced on the date the statutory trust commenced its existence in the jurisdiction in which the statutory trust was first formed, organized or otherwise came into being. The laws of this state shall apply to a statutory trust continuing under this chapter to the same extent as if the statutory trust had been organized under the laws of this state from and after the issuance of a certificate of continuance under this chapter by the secretary of state to the statutory trust. When a foreign statutory trust is continued as a statutory trust under this chapter, the continuance shall not affect the statutory trust's ownership of its property or liability for any existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened prosecutions or civil or administrative actions, convictions, rulings, orders, judgments or any other characteristics or aspects of the statutory trust and its existence.</p>
                  <p>(g) As used in this section, the term "statutory trust" shall include any business trust, association or similar entity which appears to the secretary of state to possess characteristics sufficiently similar to those of a statutory trust organized under the Wyoming Statutory Trust Act.</p>

                  <p>(a) An operating agreement may specify that its amendment requires the approval of a person that is not a party to the operating agreement or the satisfaction of a condition. An amendment is ineffective if its adoption does not include the required approval or satisfy the specified condition.</p>
                  <p>(b) The obligations of a limited liability company and its members to a person in the person's capacity as a transferee or dissociated member are governed by the operating agreement. An amendment to the operating agreement made after a person becomes a transferee or dissociated member is effective with regard to any debt, obligation or other liability of the limited liability company or its members to the person in the person's capacity as a transferee or dissociated member.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a record that has been delivered by a limited liability company to the secretary of state for filing and has become effective under this chapter contains a provision that would be ineffective under W.S. 17-29-110(c) if contained in the operating agreement, the provision is likewise ineffective in the record.</p>
                  <p>(d) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a record that has been delivered by a limited liability company to the secretary of state for filing and has become effective under this chapter conflicts with a provision of the operating agreement:</p>
                  <p>(i) The operating agreement prevails as to members, dissociated members, transferees and managers; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The record prevails as to other persons to the extent they reasonably rely on the record.</p>

                  <p>(d) Subject to W.S. 17-29-112(c), articles of organization may also contain statements as to matters other than those required by subsection (b) of this section. However, a statement in articles of organization is not effective as a statement of authority.</p>
                  <p>(e) The following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) A limited liability company is formed when the articles of organization become effective, unless the articles state a delayed effective date pursuant to W.S. 17-29-205(c);</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the articles state a delayed effective date, a limited liability company is not formed if, before the articles take effect, a statement of cancellation is signed and delivered to the secretary of state for filing and the secretary of state files the articles;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Subject to any delayed effective date and except in a proceeding by this state to dissolve a limited liability company, the filing of the articles of organization by the secretary of state is conclusive proof that the organizer satisfied all conditions to the formation of a limited liability company.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a record delivered to the secretary of state for filing under this chapter and filed by the secretary of state contains inaccurate information, a person that suffers a loss by reliance on the information may recover damages for the loss from:</p>
                  <p>(i) A person that signed the record, or caused another to sign it on the person's behalf, and knew the information to be inaccurate at the time the record was signed; and</p>

                  <p>(A) The record was delivered for filing on behalf of the company; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The member or manager had notice of the inaccuracy for a reasonably sufficient time before the information was relied upon so that, before the reliance, the member or manager reasonably could have:</p>
                  <p>(I) Effected an amendment under W.S. 17-29-202;</p>
                  <p>or</p>

                  <p>(b) To the extent that the operating agreement of a member-managed limited liability company expressly relieves a member of responsibility for maintaining the accuracy of information contained in records delivered on behalf of the company to the secretary of state for filing under this chapter and imposes that responsibility on one (1) or more other members, the liability stated in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section applies to those other members and not to the member that the operating agreement relieves of the responsibility.</p>

                  <p>(a) An operating agreement may establish or provide for the establishment of one (1) or more designated series of members, managers, transferable interests or assets. This section shall govern any matter with respect to a series to the extent not otherwise provided in the operating agreement.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if an operating agreement establishes or provides for the establishment of a particular series:</p>
                  <p>(i) The debts, obligations or other liabilities of the particular series, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be enforceable against the assets of the series only and not against:</p>
                  <p>(A) The assets of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof;</p>
                  <p>(B) Any member of the limited liability company.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The debts, obligations or other liabilities of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall not be enforceable against the assets of the particular series.</p>
                  <p>(c) The limitations on liabilities in subsection (b) of this section shall only apply if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The records for the particular series that account for the assets of the series are separately maintained from the records that account for the assets of the limited liability company or any other series thereof. Records that reasonably identify the assets of a particular series, including by specific listing, category, type, quantity, computational or allocational formula or procedure such as a percentage or share of assets or by any other method where the identity of the assets is objectively determinable, shall be deemed to account for the assets of the particular series separately from the assets of the limited liability company or any other series thereof;</p>

                  <p>(iii) Notice of the limitations on liabilities of the particular series is included in the articles of organization. Notice under this paragraph shall be sufficient whether or not the limited liability company has established or referenced any particular series in the notice.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing in this section, an operating agreement or articles of organization shall restrict:</p>
                  <p>(i) A series or limited liability company on behalf of a series from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts, obligations or other liabilities of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of the series;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A limited liability company from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts, obligations or other liabilities of a series shall be enforceable against the assets of the limited liability company generally; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-304(a), a member or manager from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise to be personally liable for any or all of the debts, obligations or other liabilities of a series.</p>
                  <p>(e) A series established under this section shall have the power and capacity to, in its own name, contract, hold title to assets including real, personal and intangible property, grant liens and security interests and sue and be sued. A series may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Have separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified property or obligations of the limited liability company or profits and losses associated with specified property or obligations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Carry on any lawful purpose regardless of whether for profit, except for the purpose of acting as a financial institution or acting as an insurer as defined in W.S. 26-1-102(a)(xvi);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Hold assets directly or indirectly, including in the name of the series or the name of the limited liability company.</p>
                  <p>(f) An operating agreement that establishes or provides for the establishment of a series may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide for classes or groups of members or managers of the series having the relative rights, powers and duties specified in the operating agreement;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide for and specify the future creation of additional classes or groups of members or managers of the series having the relative rights, powers and duties as may be established, including rights, powers and duties senior to existing classes and groups of members or managers of the series;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the operating agreement, without the vote or approval of any member or manager or class or group of members or managers of the series;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Provide that any member or class or group of members of a series shall have no voting rights;</p>
                  <p>(v) Grant to all or certain identified members or managers or class or group of members or managers of the series the right to vote on any matter separately or with all or any class or group of members or managers of the series. Voting by members or managers may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or other basis.</p>
                  <p>(g) The management of a series shall be vested as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the members of the series pursuant to W.S. 17-29-407(b). A member shall cease to be a member of a series upon the divestment of all of the member's transferable interests of the series. The fact that a person ceases to be a member of a particular series shall not by itself cause the person to cease to be a member of the limited liability company or any other series thereof or cause the termination of the series, regardless of whether the person was the last remaining member of the series; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the operating agreement provides for the management of the series in whole or in part by a manager, the management shall be vested in one (1) or more managers who shall be chosen as provided in the operating agreement and who shall hold the offices and have the responsibilities as specified in the agreement. A manager shall cease to be a manager of a series as provided in an operating agreement and subject to W.S. 17-29-407(c)(v). The fact that a person ceases to be a manager of a particular series shall not by itself cause the person to cease to be a manager of the limited liability company or any other series thereof.</p>
                  <p>(h) Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-404 and subject to subsections (j) and (m) of this section, if a member of a series becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the series with respect to the distribution. An operating agreement may provide for the establishment of a record date for allocations and distributions associated with a series.</p>
                  <p>(j) Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-405(a), a limited liability company may make a distribution with respect to a series that has been established under this section unless the total assets of the series after the distribution would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the series were to be dissolved, wound up and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon winding up and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of the persons receiving the distribution. A member that receives a distribution knowing that the distribution was made in violation of this subsection is personally liable to the series for the amount of the distribution. This subsection shall not affect any obligation or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable law for the amount of a distribution, except that any action under this subsection shall be subject to W.S. 17-29-406(e). For purposes of this subsection, "distribution" does not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business under a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program.</p>
                  <p>(k) Subject to W.S. 17-29-702, a series established under this section may be terminated and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the limited liability company. The termination of the series shall not affect the limitations on liabilities of the series as provided in subsection (b) of this section. A series is terminated and its affairs shall be wound up upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The dissolution of the limited liability company under W.S. 17-29-702;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The time or happening of events specified in the operating agreement;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The vote or consent of members of the series who own more than two-thirds (2/3) of the interests in the profits of the series; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) On application by a member or manager of the series, the entry of a court order terminating the series on the grounds that it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the purposes of the series in conformity with the operating agreement.</p>
                  <p>(m) A person winding up the affairs of a series may, in the name of the limited liability company and for and on behalf of the limited liability company and the series, take all actions with respect to the series as authorized by W.S. 17-29-702. The person shall provide for the claims and obligations of the series and distribute the assets of the series as provided in W.S. 17-29-708. Actions taken in accordance with this subsection shall not affect the liability of members and shall not impose liability on a liquidating trustee appointed in accordance with this subsection.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding W.S. 17-29-702, the following persons may wind up the affairs of a series:</p>
                  <p>(i) A manager of the series who has not wrongfully terminated the series;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the series has no manager who qualifies under paragraph (i) of this subsection, the members of the series or a person approved by the members;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The members who own more than fifty (50%) percent of the interests in the profits of the series;</p>

                  <p>(c) A statement of authority affects only the power of a person to bind a limited liability company to persons that are not members.</p>
                  <p>(d) Subject to subsection (c) of this section and W.S. 17-29-103(d) and except as otherwise provided in subsections</p>
                  <p>(f) , (g) and (h) of this section, a limitation on the authority of a person or a position contained in an effective statement of authority is not by itself evidence of knowledge or notice of the limitation by any person.</p>
                  <p>(e) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a grant of authority not pertaining to transfers of real property and contained in an effective statement of authority is conclusive in favor of a person that gives value in reliance on the grant, except to the extent that when the person gives value:</p>

                  <p>(ii) The statement has been cancelled or restrictively amended under subsection (b) of this section; or</p>

                  <p>(f) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, an effective statement of authority that grants authority to transfer real property held in the name of the limited liability company and that is recorded by certified copy in the office for recording transfers of the real property is conclusive in favor of a person that gives value in reliance on the grant without knowledge to the contrary, except to the extent that when the person gives value:</p>
                  <p>(i) The statement has been cancelled or restrictively amended under subsection (b) of this section and a certified copy of the cancellation or restrictive amendment has been recorded in the office for recording transfers of the real property; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) A limitation on the grant is contained in another statement of authority that became effective after the statement containing the grant became effective and a certified copy of the later effective statement is recorded in the office for recording transfers of the real property.</p>
                  <p>(g) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a certified copy of an effective statement containing a limitation on the authority to transfer real property held in the name of a limited liability company is recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property, all persons are deemed to know of the limitation.</p>
                  <p>(h) Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an effective statement of dissolution or termination is a cancellation of any filed statement of authority for the purposes of subsection (f) of this section and is a limitation on authority for the purposes of subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(j) After a statement of dissolution becomes effective, a limited liability company may deliver to the secretary of state for filing and, if appropriate, may record a statement of authority that is designated as a post dissolution statement of authority. The statement operates as provided in subsections</p>
                  <p>(f) and (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) Unless earlier cancelled, an effective statement of authority is cancelled by operation of law five (5) years after the date on which the statement, or its most recent amendment, becomes effective. This cancellation operates without need for any recording under subsection (f) or (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(m) An effective statement of denial operates as a restrictive amendment under this section and may be recorded by certified copy for the purposes of paragraph (f)(i) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(i) To the extent otherwise provided in a written or verbal operating agreement as set forth in W.S. 17-29-110;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To the extent necessary to comply with any transfer effective under W.S. 17-29-502 and any charging order in effect under W.S. 17-29-503; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) To the extent otherwise represented by the company through an authorized representative in tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service in which the status elected by the company is not timely disputed by any member.</p>
                  <p>(b) A person has a right to a distribution before the dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company only if the company decides to make an interim distribution. A person's dissociation does not entitle the person to a distribution.</p>
                  <p>(c) A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than money. Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 17-29-708(c), a limited liability company may distribute an asset in kind if each part of the asset is fungible with each other part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the person's share of distributions.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a member or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member or transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution.</p>

                  <p>(a) A limited liability company shall not make a distribution if after the distribution:</p>
                  <p>(i) The company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the company's activities; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution.</p>
                  <p>(b) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) of this section on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the effect of a distribution under subsection (a) of this section is measured:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the case of a distribution by purchase, redemption or other acquisition of a transferable interest in the company, as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the company; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) In all other cases, as of the date:</p>
                  <p>(A) The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty (120) days after that date; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The payment is made, if the payment occurs more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the distribution is authorized.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing, a limited liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors.</p>
                  <p>(e) A limited liability company's indebtedness, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not a liability for purposes of subsection (a) of this section if the terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest are made only to the extent that a distribution could be made to members under this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) If indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made.</p>
                  <p>(g) In subsection (a) of this section, "distribution" does not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business under a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program.</p>

                  <p>(b) To the extent the operating agreement of a member- managed limited liability company expressly relieves a member of the authority and responsibility to consent to distributions and imposes that authority and responsibility on one (1) or more other members, the liability stated in subsection (a) of this section applies to the other members and not the member that the operating agreement relieves of authority and responsibility.</p>

                  <p>(e) An action under this section is barred if not commenced within two (2) years after the distribution.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-29-407. Management of limited liability company.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A limited liability company is a member-managed limited liability company unless the articles of organization or the operating agreement:</p>
                  <p>(i) Expressly provides that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The company is or will be "manager-managed";</p>
                  <p>(B) The company is or will be "managed by managers"; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Management of the company is or will be</p>
                  <p>"vested in managers"; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Includes words of similar import.</p>
                  <p>(b) In a member-managed limited liability company, unless the articles of organization or the operating agreement provide otherwise, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The management and conduct of the company are vested in the members;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Each member has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's activities except:</p>
                  <p>(A) That a member's interest is otherwise defined in W.S. 17-29-102(a)(xxiv);</p>
                  <p>(B) To the extent otherwise provided in any other provision in this chapter; or</p>
                  <p>(C) To the extent otherwise represented by the company through an authorized representative in tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service in which the status elected by the company is not timely disputed by any member.</p>
                  <p>(iii) A difference arising among members as to a matter in the ordinary course of the activities of the company may be decided by a majority of the members;</p>
                  <p>(iv) An act outside the ordinary course of the activities of the company may be undertaken only with the consent of all members;</p>
                  <p>(v) The operating agreement may be amended only with the consent of all members.</p>
                  <p>(c) In a manager-managed limited liability company, unless the articles of organization or the operating agreement provide otherwise, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, any matter relating to the activities of the company is decided exclusively by the managers;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Each manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the activities of the company;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A difference arising among managers as to a matter in the ordinary course of the activities of the company may be decided by a majority of the managers;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The consent of all members is required to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of the company's property, with or without the good will, outside the ordinary course of the company's activities;</p>
                  <p>(B) Approve a merger, conversion, continuance, transfer or domestication under article 10 of this chapter;</p>
                  <p>(C) Undertake any other act outside the ordinary course of the company's activities; and</p>
                  <p>(D) Amend the operating agreement.</p>
                  <p>(v) A manager may be chosen at any time by the consent of a majority of the members and remains a manager until a successor has been chosen, unless the manager at an earlier time resigns, is removed or dies, or, in the case of a manager that is not an individual, terminates. A manager may be removed at any time by the consent of a majority of the members without notice or cause;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A person need not be a member to be a manager, but the dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes the person as a manager. If a person that is both a manager and a member ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by itself dissociate the person as a member;</p>
                  <p>(vii) A person's ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt, obligation or other liability to the limited liability company or members which the person incurred while a manager.</p>
                  <p>(d) An action requiring the consent of members under this article may be taken without a meeting, and a member may appoint a proxy or other agent to consent or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointing record, personally or by the member's agent.</p>
                  <p>(e) The dissolution of a limited liability company does not affect the applicability of this section. However, a person that wrongfully causes dissolution of the company loses the right to participate in management as a member and a manager.</p>
                  <p>(f) This article does not entitle a member to remuneration for services performed for a member-managed limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the activities of the company.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>17-29-409. Standards of conduct for members and managers.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A member of a member-managed limited liability company owes to the company and, subject to W.S. 17-29-901(b), the other members the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections (b) and (c).</p>
                  <p>(b) The duty of loyalty of a member in a member-managed limited liability company includes the duties:</p>
                  <p>(i) To account to the company and to hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the member:</p>
                  <p>(A) In the conduct or winding up of the company's activities;</p>
                  <p>(B) From a use by the member of the company's property; or</p>
                  <p>(C) From the appropriation of a limited liability company opportunity;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To refrain from dealing with the company in the conduct or winding up of the company's activities as or on behalf of a person having an interest adverse to the company; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) To refrain from competing with the company in the conduct of the company's activities before the dissolution of the company.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subject to the business judgment rule, the duty of care of a member of a member-managed limited liability company in the conduct and winding up of the company's activities is to act with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the member reasonably believes to be in the best interests or at least not opposed to the best interests of the company. In discharging this duty, a member may rely in good faith upon opinions, reports, statements or other information provided by another person that the member reasonably believes is a competent and reliable source for the information.</p>
                  <p>(d) A member in a member-managed limited liability company or a manager-managed limited liability company shall discharge the duties under this chapter or under the operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing.</p>
                  <p>(e) It is a defense to a claim under paragraph (b)(ii) of this section and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction was fair to or at least not opposed to the limited liability company.</p>
                  <p>(f) All of the members of a member-managed limited liability company or a manager-managed limited liability company may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.</p>
                  <p>(g) In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Subsections (a), (b), (c) and (e) of this section apply to the manager or managers and not the members;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The duty stated under paragraph (b)(iii) of this section continues until winding up is completed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Subsection (d) of this section applies to the members and managers;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Subsection (f) of this section applies only to the members;</p>
                  <p>(v) A member does not have any fiduciary duty to the company or to any other member solely by reason of being a member.</p>

                  <p>(i) On reasonable notice, a member may inspect and copy during regular business hours, at a reasonable location specified by the company, any record maintained by the company regarding the company's activities, financial condition and other circumstances, to the extent the information is material to the member's rights and duties under the operating agreement or this chapter;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The company shall furnish to each member:</p>
                  <p>(A) On demand, any information concerning the company's activities, financial condition and other circumstances which the company knows and is material to the proper exercise of the member's rights and duties under the operating agreement or this chapter, except to the extent the company can establish that it reasonably believes the member already knows the information; and</p>
                  <p>(B) On demand, any other information concerning the company's activities, financial condition and other circumstances, except to the extent the demand or information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The duty to furnish information under paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection also applies to each member to the extent the member knows any of the information described in paragraph (ii) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The informational rights stated in subsection (a) of this section and the duty stated in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section apply to the managers and not the members;</p>
                  <p>(ii) During regular business hours and at a reasonable location specified by the company, a member may obtain from the company and inspect and copy full information regarding the activities, financial condition and other circumstances of the company as is just and reasonable if:</p>
                  <p>(A) The member seeks the information for a purpose material to the member's interest as a member;</p>
                  <p>(B) The member makes a demand in a record received by the company, describing with reasonable particularity the information sought and the purpose for seeking the information; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The information sought is directly connected to the member's purpose.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Within ten (10) days after receiving a demand pursuant to subparagraph (ii)(B) of this subsection, the company shall in a record inform the member that made the demand:</p>
                  <p>(A) Of the information that the company will provide in response to the demand and when and where the company will provide the information; and</p>
                  <p>(B) If the company declines to provide any demanded information, the company's reasons for declining.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Whenever this chapter or an operating agreement provides for a member to give or withhold consent to a matter, before the consent is given or withheld, the company shall, upon demand, provide the member with all information that is known to the company and is material to the member's decision.</p>
                  <p>(c) On ten (10) days' demand made in a record received by a limited liability company, a dissociated member may have access to information to which the person was entitled while a member if the information pertains to the period during which the person was a member, the person seeks the information in good faith and the person satisfies the requirements imposed on a member by paragraph (b)(ii) of this section. The company shall respond to a demand made pursuant to this subsection in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(iii) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) A limited liability company may charge a person that makes a demand under this section the reasonable costs of copying, limited to the costs of labor and material.</p>
                  <p>(e) A member or dissociated member may exercise rights under this section through an agent or, in the case of an individual under legal disability, a legal representative. Any restriction or condition imposed by the operating agreement or under subsection (g) of this section applies both to the agent or legal representative and the member or dissociated member.</p>
                  <p>(f) The rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee.</p>
                  <p>(g) In addition to any restriction or condition stated in its operating agreement, a limited liability company, as a matter within the ordinary course of its activities, may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under this section, including designating information confidential and imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient. In a dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the company has the burden of proving reasonableness.</p>

                  <p>(i) Is permissible;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, does not by itself cause a member's dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company's activities; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Subject to W.S. 17-29-504, does not entitle the transferee to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Participate in the management or conduct of the company's activities; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Except as otherwise provided in subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section, have access to records or other information concerning the company's activities.</p>
                  <p>(b) A transferee has the right to receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled.</p>
                  <p>(c) In a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company, a transferee is entitled to an account of the company's transactions only from the date of dissolution.</p>
                  <p>(d) A transferable interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by the limited liability company in a record, and, subject to this section, the interest represented by the certificate may be transferred by a transfer of the certificate.</p>
                  <p>(e) A limited liability company need not give effect to a transferee's rights under this section until the company has notice of the transfer.</p>
                  <p>(f) A transfer of a transferable interest in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in the operating agreement is ineffective as to a person having notice of the restriction at the time of transfer.</p>
                  <p>(g) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 17-29-602(a)(iv)(B), when a member transfers a transferable interest, the transferor retains the rights of a member other than the interest in distributions transferred and retains all duties and obligations of a member.</p>
                  <p>(h) When a member transfers a transferable interest to a person that becomes a member with respect to the transferred interest, the transferee is liable for the member's obligations under W.S. 17-29-403 and 17-29-406(c) known to the transferee when the transferee becomes a member.</p>

                  <p>(a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order requires the limited liability company to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.</p>
                  <p>(b) Reserved.</p>
                  <p>(c) Reserved.</p>
                  <p>(d) The member or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) of this section may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order.</p>
                  <p>(e) A limited liability company or one (1) or more members whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.</p>
                  <p>(f) This article does not deprive any member or transferee of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to the member's or transferee's transferable interest.</p>
                  <p>(g) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking to enforce a judgment against a judgment debtor, including any judgment debtor who may be the sole member, dissociated member or transferee, may, in the capacity of the judgment creditor, satisfy the judgment from the judgment debtor's transferable interest or from the assets of the limited liability company. Other remedies, including foreclosure on the judgment debtor's limited liability interest and a court order for directions, accounts and inquiries that the judgment debtor might have made are not available to the judgment creditor attempting to satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's interest in the limited liability company and may not be ordered by the court.</p>

                  <p>(a) When a person is dissociated as a member of a limited liability company:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person's right to participate as a member in the management and conduct of the company's activities terminates;</p>

                  <p>(b) A person's dissociation as a member of a limited liability company does not of itself discharge the person from any debt, obligation or other liability to the company or the other members which the person incurred while a member.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a limited liability company is named as or made a party in a derivative proceeding, the company may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the proceeding and determine whether pursuing the action is in the best interests of the company. If the company appoints a special litigation committee, on motion by the committee made in the name of the company, except for good cause shown, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation. This subsection does not prevent the court from enforcing a person's right to information under W.S. 17-29-410 or, for good cause shown, granting extraordinary relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.</p>
                  <p>(b) A special litigation committee may be composed of one (1) or more disinterested and independent individuals, who may be members.</p>
                  <p>(c) A special litigation committee may be appointed:</p>
                  <p>(i) In a member-managed limited liability company:</p>
                  <p>(A) By the consent of a majority of the members not named as defendants or plaintiffs in the proceeding; and</p>
                  <p>(B) If all members are named as defendants or plaintiffs in the proceeding, by a majority of the members named as defendants; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) In a manager-managed limited liability company:</p>
                  <p>(A) By a majority of the managers not named as defendants or plaintiffs in the proceeding; and</p>
                  <p>(B) If all managers are named as defendants or plaintiffs in the proceeding, by a majority of the managers named as defendants.</p>
                  <p>(d) After appropriate investigation, a special litigation committee may determine that it is in the best interests of the limited liability company that the proceeding:</p>
                  <p>(i) Continue under the control of the plaintiff;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Continue under the control of the committee;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Be settled on terms approved by the committee;</p>
                  <p>or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Be dismissed.</p>
                  <p>(e) After making a determination under subsection (d) of this section, a special litigation committee shall file with the court a statement of its determination and its report supporting its determination, giving notice to the plaintiff. The court shall determine whether the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, with the committee having the burden of proof. If the court finds that the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and that the committee acted in good faith, independently and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered under subsection (a) of this section and allow the action to proceed under the direction of the plaintiff.</p>

The secretary of state may issue a certificate of registration upon receipt of an application supported by articles of continuance as provided by this act together with the statements, information and documents set out in subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section. The certificate of registration may then be issued continuing the organization in Wyoming as if it had been organized as a limited liability company in this state.</p>
                  <p>The certificate of registration may be subject to any limitations and conditions as may appear proper to the secretary of state.</p>

                  <p>(e) The provisions of the articles of continuance may, without expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the organization's articles of organization or equivalent basic charter or other authorization, if the variation is one which a company organized under the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act could effect by way of amendment to its articles of organization. Upon issuance of a certificate of continuance by the secretary of state, the articles of continuance shall be deemed to be the articles of organization of the continued organization. The organization may elect to incorporate by reference in the articles of continuance its basic charter or other authorization which has been adopted by it in the foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the same to continue to act as the articles of organization, provided, however, that the basic charter or other authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make the same conform to the laws of Wyoming and to the provisions of the articles of continuance.</p>
                  <p>(f) Except for the purpose of W.S. 16-6-101 through 16-6-118, the existence of any organization heretofore or hereafter issued a certificate of continuation under this act shall be deemed to have commenced on the date the organization commenced its existence in the jurisdiction in which it was first formed, organized or otherwise came into being. The laws of Wyoming shall apply to an organization continuing under this act to the same extent as if it had been organized under the laws of Wyoming from and after the issuance of a certificate of continuation under this act by the secretary of state. When a foreign organization is continued under this act, the continuance shall not affect the ownership of its property, or its liability for any existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened prosecution or civil or administration actions, convictions, rulings, orders or judgments.</p>
                  <p>(g) Continuance under this act does not deprive a member of any right or privilege that he claims under, or relieve any member of any liability in respect of, his membership.</p>

                  <p>(a) A beneficiary may have a beneficial interest in the property of the statutory foundation in the form of cash, property, a promissory note or other obligation. A beneficiary may have a beneficial interest in a statutory foundation without making a contribution, or being obligated to make a contribution, to the foundation.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a beneficial owner shall have an undivided beneficial interest in the property of the statutory foundation and shall share in the profits or losses of the foundation in the proportion of the entire undivided beneficial interest he owns in the foundation. The governing instrument of a statutory foundation may provide that the foundation or the directors, acting for and on behalf of the foundation, shall be deemed to hold beneficial ownership of any income earned on securities of the foundation issued by any business entities formed, organized or existing under the laws of any jurisdiction, including the laws of any foreign country.</p>

Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a beneficial owner has no interest in specific foundation property.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, the transferee of the beneficial interest of a beneficial owner in the statutory foundation shall only be entitled to receive the share of profits and the return of contributions to which the beneficial owner otherwise would be entitled. In the absence of the unanimous written consent of the owners of all other beneficial interests and of all directors of the foundation, and except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, the transferee of the beneficial interest of a beneficial owner shall have no right to participate in or be kept apprised of the affairs of the foundation or to become a beneficial owner of a beneficial interest in the foundation.</p>
                  <p>(f) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the governing instrument, at the time a beneficial owner becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the owner has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the statutory foundation with respect to the distribution. A governing instrument may provide for the establishment of record dates with respect to allocations and distributions by a statutory foundation.</p>

                  <p>(b) The secretary of state may issue a certificate of registration upon receipt of an application supported by articles of continuance specified by subsection (e) of this section together with the other statements, information and documents required by this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon issuance of a certificate of registration by the secretary of state, the foreign foundation shall continue to operate under the laws of this state as if the foreign foundation had been organized as a statutory foundation in this state.

                  <p>(h) Upon issuance of a certificate of registration by the secretary of state, the articles of continuance shall be deemed to be the articles of formation of the foreign foundation.

                  <p>(g) The statutory foundation may represent to the proper officer of the foreign jurisdiction to which the statutory foundation is transferred that the laws of this state permit such transfer, and may describe the authorization extended by this section as permitting the continuance or other transfer of domicile as may be required by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, in order for the statutory foundation to be accepted in that foreign jurisdiction, provided that the statutory foundation may not misrepresent the requirements or effects of this section.</p>
