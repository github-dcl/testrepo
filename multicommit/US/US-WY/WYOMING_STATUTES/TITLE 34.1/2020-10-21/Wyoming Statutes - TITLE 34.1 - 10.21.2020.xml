                <p>(a) Subject to subsection (f) of this section, a person has "notice" of a fact if the person:</p>
                <p>(i) Has actual knowledge of it;</p>
                <p>(ii) Has received a notice or notification of it; or</p>
                <p>(iii) From all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that it exists.</p>
                <p>(b) "Knowledge" means actual knowledge. "Knows" has a corresponding meaning.</p>
                <p>(c) "Discover," "learn," or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than to reason to know.</p>
                <p>(d) A person "notifies" or "gives" a notice or notification to another person by taking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.</p>
                <p>(e) Subject to subsection (f) of this section, a person "receives" a notice or notification when:</p>
                <p>(i) It comes to that person's attention; or</p>
                <p>(ii) It is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of such communications.</p>
                <p>(f) Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-1-203. Lease distinguished from security interest.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case.</p>
                <p>(b) A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee and:</p>
                <p>(i) The original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods;</p>
                <p>(ii) The lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods;</p>
                <p>(iii) The lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement; or</p>
                <p>(iv) The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.</p>
                <p>(c) A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because:</p>
                <p>(i) The present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into;</p>
                <p>(ii) The lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods;</p>
                <p>(iii) The lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs;</p>
                <p>(iv) The lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods;</p>
                <p>(v) The lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed; or</p>
                <p>(vi) The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.</p>
                <p>(d) Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additional consideration is not nominal if:</p>
                <p>(i) When the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed; or</p>
                <p>(ii) When the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed.</p>
                <p>(e) The "remaining economic life of the goods" and "reasonably predictable" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement shall be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.</p>

                <p>(a) A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:</p>
                <p>(i) The agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.</p>
                <p>(b) A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.</p>
                <p>(c) A "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage shall be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.</p>
                <p>(d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.</p>
                <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable:</p>
                <p>(i) Express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;</p>
                <p>(ii) Course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.</p>
                <p>(f) Subject to W.S. 34.1-2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.</p>
                <p>(g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one (1) party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.</p>

The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.</p>

                <p>(a) "Merchant" means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.</p>
                <p>(b) "Financing agency" means a bank, finance company or other person who in the ordinary course of business makes advances against goods or documents of title or who by arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make or collect payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying the seller's draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for collection whether or not documents of title accompany or are associated with the draft. "Financing agency" includes also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (section 34.1-2-707).</p>
                <p>(c) "Between merchants" means in any transaction with respect to which both parties are chargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-2-105. Definitions: Transferability; "goods"; "future" goods; "lot"; "commercial unit".</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) "Goods" means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (article 8) and things in action. "Goods" also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (section 34.1-2-107).</p>
                <p>(b) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are "future" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.</p>
                <p>(c) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods.</p>
                <p>(d) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common.</p>
                <p>(e) "Lot" means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract.</p>
                <p>(f) "Commercial unit" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.</p>

                <p>(a) In this article unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (section 34.1-2-401). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.</p>
                <p>(b) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.</p>
                <p>(c) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.</p>
                <p>(d) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.</p>

                <p>(a) A contract for the sale of timber, minerals or the like or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this article if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.</p>
                <p>(b) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in subsection (a) is a contract for the sale of goods within this article whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance.</p>
                <p>(c) The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.</p>
                <p>(b) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection</p>
                <p>(a) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within ten (10) days after it is received.</p>
                <p>(c) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable:</p>
                <p>(i) If the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or</p>
                <p>(ii) If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or</p>
                <p>(iii) With respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (section 34.1-2-606).</p>

                <p>(a) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</p>
                <p>(b) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:</p>
                <p>(i) The offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;</p>
                <p>(ii) They materially alter it; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.</p>
                <p>(c) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this act.</p>

                <p>(a) An agreement modifying a contract within this article needs no consideration to be binding.</p>
                <p>(b) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.</p>
                <p>(c) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this article (section 34.1-2-201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.</p>
                <p>(d) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (b) or (c) it can operate as a waiver.</p>
                <p>(e) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-2-210. Delegation of performance; assignment of rights.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in section 34.1-9-406, unless otherwise agreed, all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</p>
                <p>(c) The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (b) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (1) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (2) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.</p>
                <p>(d) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of "the contract" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.</p>
                <p>(e) An assignment of "the contract" or of "all my rights under the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.</p>
                <p>(f) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (section 34.1-2-609).</p>

                <p>(a) The price can be made payable in money or otherwise. If it is payable in whole or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goods which he is to transfer.</p>
                <p>(b) Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the transfer of the goods and the seller's obligations with reference to them are subject to this article, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor's obligations in connection therewith.</p>

                <p>(a) The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if:</p>
                <p>(i) Nothing is said as to price; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or</p>
                <p>(iii) The price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.</p>
                <p>(b) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.</p>
                <p>(c) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one (1) party the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price.</p>
                <p>(d) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.</p>

                <p>(iii) If delivery is authorized and made by way of documents of title otherwise than by subdivision (ii) then payment is due regardless of where the goods are to be received:</p>

                <p>(a) An agreement for sale which is otherwise sufficiently definite (section 34.1-2-204(c)) to be a contract is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one (1) of the parties. Any such specification must be made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.</p>

                <p>(c) Where such specification would materially affect the other party's performance but is not seasonably made or where one party's cooperation is necessary to the agreed performance of the other but is not seasonably forthcoming, the other party in addition to all other remedies:</p>
                <p>(i) Is excused for any resulting delay in his own performance; and</p>
                <p>(ii) May also either proceed to perform in any reasonable manner or after the time for a material part of his own performance treat the failure to specify or to cooperate as a breach by failure to deliver or accept the goods.</p>

                <p>(i) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise;</p>

                <p>(b) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as "warrant" or "guarantee" or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.</p>

                <p>(a) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 34.1-2-202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to subsection (c), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof."</p>
                <p>(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section:</p>
                <p>(i) Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", "with all faults" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and</p>
                <p>(ii) When the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and</p>
                <p>(iii) An implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade; and</p>
                <p>(iv) The implied warranties of merchantability and fitness shall not be applicable to a contract for the sale of human blood, blood plasma or other human tissue or organs from an individual or a blood bank or reservoir of such other tissues or organs. Such blood, blood plasma or tissue or organs shall not for the purpose of this article be considered commodities subject to sale or barter, but shall be considered as medical services;</p>
                <p>(v) With respect to the sale of cattle, hogs, sheep and horses, there shall be no implied warranty that the cattle, hogs, sheep and horses are free from disease.</p>
                <p>(d) Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with the provisions of this article on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual modification of remedy (sections 34.1-2-718 and 34.1-2-719).</p>

In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description;</p>
                <p>(ii) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description;</p>

                <p>(a) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means "free on board") at a named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which:</p>
                <p>(i) When the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this article (section 34.1-2-504) and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier; or</p>
                <p>(ii) When the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provided in this article (section 34.1-2-503);</p>
                <p>(iii) When under either subdivision (i) or (ii) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this article on the form of bill of lading (section 34.1-2-323).</p>
                <p>(b) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means "free alongside") at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which the seller must:</p>
                <p>(i) At his own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the manner usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the buyer; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the carrier is under a duty to issue a bill of lading.</p>
                <p>(c) Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within subsection (a)(i) or (iii) or subsection (b) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of the vessel and in an appropriate case its name and sailing date. The seller may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation under this article (section 34.1-2-311). He may also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipment.</p>
                <p>(d) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.</p>

                <p>(a) The term C.I.F. means that the price includes in a lump sum the costs of goods and the insurance and freight to the named destination. The term C. &amp; F. or C.F. means that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination.</p>
                <p>(b) Unless otherwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the seller at his own expense and risk to:</p>
                <p>(i) Put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Prepare an invoice of the goods and procure any other documents required to effect shipment or to comply with the contract; and</p>
                <p>(v) Forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due form and with any indorsement necessary to perfect the buyer's rights.</p>
                <p>(c) Unless otherwise agreed the term C. &amp; F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance.</p>
                <p>(d) Under the term C.I.F. or C. &amp; F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.</p>

                <p>(i) Where the price is based on or is to be adjusted according to "net landed weights", "delivered weights", "out turn" quantity or quality or the like, unless otherwise agreed the seller must reasonably estimate the price. The payment due on tender of the documents called for by the contract is the amount so estimated, but after final adjustment of the price a settlement must be made with commercial promptness;</p>
                <p>(ii) An agreement described in subdivision (a)(i) or any warranty of quality or condition of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrinkage and the like in transportation but has no effect on the place or time of identification to the contract for sale or delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss;</p>
                <p>(iii) Unless otherwise agreed where the contract provides for payment on or after arrival of the goods the seller must before payment allow such preliminary inspection as is feasible; but if the goods are lost delivery of the documents and payment are due when the goods should have arrived.</p>

                <p>(b) Under such a term unless otherwise agreed:</p>

                <p>(ii) The risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship's tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded.</p>

                <p>(a) Where the contract contemplates overseas shipment and contains a term C.I.F. or C. &amp; F. or F.O.B. vessel, the seller unless otherwise agreed must obtain a negotiable bill of lading stating that the goods have been loaded on board or, in the case of a term C.I.F. or C. &amp; F., received for shipment.</p>
                <p>(b) Where in a case within subsection (a) a tangible bill of lading has been issued in a set of parts, unless otherwise agreed if the documents are not to be sent from abroad the buyer may demand tender of the full set, otherwise only one (1) part of the bill of lading need be tendered. Even if the agreement expressly requires a full set:</p>
                <p>(i) Due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this article on cure of improper delivery (section 34.1-2-508(a)); and</p>
                <p>(ii) Even though the full set is demanded, if the documents are sent from abroad the person tendering an incomplete set may nevertheless require payment upon furnishing an indemnity which the buyer in good faith deems adequate.</p>

                <p>(c) Unless otherwise agreed the term "letter of credit" or "banker's credit" in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term "confirmed credit" means that the credit must also carry the direct obligation of such an agency which does business in the seller's financial market.</p>

                <p>(b) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner.

                <p>(c) Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-2-401. Passing of title; reservation for security; limited application of this section.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Each provision of this article with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (section 34.1-2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this act. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest.</p>
                <p>Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the article on secured transactions (article 9), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties;</p>
                <p>(ii) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading:</p>
                <p>(A) If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but</p>
                <p>(B) If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.</p>
                <p>(iii) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods:</p>
                <p>(A) If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or</p>
                <p>(B) If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</p>
                <p>(iv) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale".</p>

                <p>(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), rights of unsecured creditors of the seller with respect to goods which have been identified to a contract for sale are subject to the buyer's rights to recover the goods under this article (sections 34.1-2-502 and 34.1-2-716).</p>
                <p>(b) A creditor of the seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against him a retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated, except that retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification is not fraudulent.</p>
                <p>(c) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to impair the rights of creditors of the seller:</p>
                <p>(i) Under the provisions of the article on secured transactions (article 9); or</p>
                <p>(ii) Where identification to the contract or delivery is made not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a preexisting claim for money, security or the like and is made under circumstances which under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated would apart from this article constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-2-403. Power to transfer; good faith purchase of goods; "entrusting".</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor has or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though:</p>
                <p>(i) The transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; or</p>
                <p>(iii) It was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale"; or</p>
                <p>(iv) The delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.</p>
                <p>(b) Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.</p>
                <p>(c) "Entrusting" includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery of acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.</p>
                <p>(d) The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the articles on secured transactions (article 9) and documents of title (article 7).</p>

                <p>(a) The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are nonconforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs:</p>
                <p>(i) When the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in subdivision (iii), when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;</p>
                <p>(iii) When the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve (12) months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within twelve (12) months or the next normal harvest season after contracting whichever is longer.</p>
                <p>(b) The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.</p>
                <p>(c) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of the immediately preceding section may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if:</p>
                <p>(i) In the case of goods bought for personal, family or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract; or</p>
                <p>(ii) In all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within ten (10) days after receipt of the first installment on their price.</p>
                <p>(b) The buyer's right to recover the goods under paragraph (a)(i) vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.</p>
                <p>(c) If the identification creating his special property has been made by the buyer he acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-2-503. Manner of seller's tender of delivery.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this article, and in particular:</p>
                <p>(i) Tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but</p>
                <p>(ii) Unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.</p>
                <p>(b) Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.</p>
                <p>(c) Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (a) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (d) and (e) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved:</p>
                <p>(i) Tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; but</p>
                <p>(ii) Tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and except as otherwise provided in article 9 of this title receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.</p>
                <p>(e) Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents:</p>
                <p>(i) He must tender all such documents in correct form except as provided in this article with respect to bills of lading in a set (section 34.1-2-323(b)); and</p>
                <p>(ii) Tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection.</p>

                <p>(a) Where the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the contract does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then unless otherwise agreed he must:</p>
                <p>(i) Put the goods in the possession of such a carrier and make such a contract for their transportation as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Obtain and promptly deliver or tender in due form any document necessary to enable the buyer to obtain possession of the goods or otherwise required by the agreement or by usage of trade; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.</p>

                <p>(a) Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment:</p>
                <p>(i) His procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves in him a security interest in the goods. His procurement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller's expectation of transferring that interest to the person named;</p>
                <p>(ii) A nonnegotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (section 34.1-2-507(b)) a nonnegotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession or control of the bill of lading.</p>
                <p>(b) When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract nor the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.</p>

                <p>(b) The right to reimbursement of a financing agency which has in good faith honored or purchased the draft under commitment to or authority from the buyer is not impaired by subsequent discovery of defects with reference to any relevant document which was apparently regular.</p>

                <p>(a) Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier:</p>
                <p>(i) If it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment is under reservation (section 34.1-2-505); but</p>
                <p>(ii) If it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.</p>
                <p>(b) Where the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the buyer:</p>

                <p>(c) In any case not within subsection (a) or (b), the risk of loss passes to the buyer on his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on tender of delivery.</p>

                <p>(a) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (c), where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. When the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.</p>

                <p>(c) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this article on C.I.F. contracts (section 34.1-2-321(a)(iii)), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods before payment of the price when the contract provides:</p>
                <p>(i) For delivery "C.O.D." or on other like terms; or</p>
                <p>(ii) For payment against documents of title, except where such payment is due only after the goods are to become available for inspection.</p>
                <p>(d) A place or method of inspection filed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract.</p>

                <p>(a) Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. It is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to the provisions of the two (2) following sections on rejected goods (sections 34.1-2-603 and 34.1-2-604):</p>
                <p>(i) After rejection any exercise of ownership by the buyer with respect to any commercial unit is wrongful as against the seller; and</p>
                <p>(ii) If the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this article (section 34.1-2-711(c)), he is under a duty after rejection to hold them with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them; but</p>
                <p>(iii) The buyer has no further obligation with regard to goods rightfully rejected.</p>
                <p>(c) The seller's rights with respect to goods wrongfully rejected are governed by the provisions of this article on seller's remedies in general (section 34.1-2-703).</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to any security interest in the buyer (section 34.1-2-711(c)), when the seller has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection a merchant buyer is under a duty after rejection of goods in his possession or control to follow any reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to the goods and in the absence of such instructions to make reasonable efforts to sell them for the seller's account if they are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily.</p>
                <p>Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.</p>
                <p>(b) When the buyer sells goods under subsection (a), he is entitled to reimbursement from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten percent (10%) on the gross proceeds.</p>
                <p>(c) In complying with this section the buyer is held only to good faith and good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance nor conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.</p>

                <p>(i) Where the seller could have cured it if stated seasonably; or</p>

                <p>(i) After a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Fails to make an effective rejection (section 34.1-2-602(a)), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Does any act inconsistent with the seller's ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.</p>
                <p>(b) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.</p>

                <p>(a) The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted.</p>
                <p>(b) Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a nonconformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this article for nonconformity.</p>
                <p>(c) Where a tender has been accepted:</p>
                <p>(i) The buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; and</p>
                <p>(ii) If the claim is one for infringement or the like (section 34.1-2-312(c)) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.</p>
                <p>(d) The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goods accepted.</p>

                <p>(i) He may give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination of fact common to the two (2) litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend he is so bound;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the claim is one for infringement or the like (section 34.1-2-312(c)) the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.</p>
                <p>(f) The provisions of subsections (c), (d) and (e) apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (section 34.1-2-312(c)).</p>

                <p>(a) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it:</p>
                <p>(i) On the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurances.</p>
                <p>(b) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects.

                <p>(a) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.</p>
                <p>(b) Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.</p>
                <p>(c) Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of further performance.</p>
                <p>(d) After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty (30) days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.</p>

                <p>(iii) In either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this article on the seller's right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (section 34.1-2-704).</p>

                <p>(b) Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this article (section 34.1-2-609).</p>

                <p>(a) An "installment contract" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause "each delivery is a separate contract" or its equivalent.</p>
                <p>(b) The buyer may reject any installment which is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (c) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.</p>
                <p>(c) Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one (1) or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.</p>

                <p>(a) Where the contract requires for its performance goods identified when the contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of either party before the risk of loss passes to the buyer, or in a proper case under a "no arrival, no sale" term (section 34.1-2-324) then:</p>
                <p>(i) If the loss is total the contract is voided; and</p>
                <p>(ii) If the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract the buyer may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the contract as avoided or accept the goods with due allowance from the contract price for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the seller.</p>

                <p>(a) Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, such substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.</p>
                <p>(b) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer provides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the buyer's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.</p>

                <p>(a) Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to the preceding section on substituted performance:</p>
                <p>(i) Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with subdivisions (ii) and (iii) is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid;</p>
                <p>(ii) Where the causes mentioned in subdivision (i) affect only a part of the seller's capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contract as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable;</p>
                <p>(iii) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under subdivision (ii), of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.</p>

Except as provided in this subsection the seller may not base a right to reclaim goods on the buyer's fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation of solvency or of intent to pay.</p>
                <p>(c) The seller's right to reclaim under subsection (b) is subject to the rights of a buyer in ordinary course or other good faith purchaser under this article (section 34.1-2-403). Successful reclamation of goods excludes all other remedies with respect to them.</p>

                <p>(a) Under the conditions stated in section 34.1-2-703 on seller's remedies, the seller may resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of this article (section 34.1-2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one (1) or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.</p>
                <p>(c) Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.</p>
                <p>(d) Where the resale is at public sale:</p>
                <p>(i) Only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and</p>
                <p>(ii) It must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is reasonably available and except in the case of goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of the resale; and</p>
                <p>(iii) If the goods are not to be within the view of those attending the sale the notification of sale must state the place where the goods are located and provide for their reasonable inspection by prospective bidders; and</p>
                <p>(iv) The seller may buy.</p>
                <p>(e) A purchaser who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the seller fails to comply with one (1) or more of the requirements of this section.</p>
                <p>(f) The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A person in the position of a seller (section 34.1-2-707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security interest, as hereinafter defined (section 34.1-2-711(c)).</p>

                <p>(b) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (a) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this article (section 34.1-2-710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.</p>

                <p>(i) Of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has passed to the buyer; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after reasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing.</p>
                <p>(b) Where the seller sues for the price he must hold for the buyer any goods which have been identified to the contract and are still in his control except that if resale becomes possible he may resell them at any time prior to the collection of the judgment. The net proceeds of any such resale must be credited to the buyer and payment of the judgment entitles him to any goods not resold.</p>
                <p>(c) After the buyer has wrongfully rejected or revokes acceptance of the goods or has failed to make a payment due or has repudiated (section 34.1-2-610), a seller who is held not entitled to the price under this section shall nevertheless be awarded damages for nonacceptance under the preceding section.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of this article with respect to proof of market price (section 34.1-2-723), the measure of damages for nondelivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this article (section 34.1-2-715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.</p>
                <p>(b) Market price is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.</p>

                <p>(a) Where the buyer has accepted goods and given notification (section 34.1-2-607) he may recover as damages for any nonconformity of tender the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller's breach as determined in any manner which is reasonable.</p>
                <p>(b) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.</p>
                <p>(c) In a proper case any incidental and consequential damages under the next section may also be recovered.</p>

In the case of goods bought for personal, family or household purposes, the buyer's right of replevin vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.</p>

                <p>(a) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.</p>
                <p>(b) Where the seller justifiably withholds delivery of goods because of the buyer's breach, the buyer is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payment exceeds:</p>
                <p>(i) The amount to which the seller is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the seller's damages in accordance with subsection (a); or</p>
                <p>(ii) In the absence of such terms, twenty percent (20%) of the value of the total performance for which the buyer is obligated under the contract or five hundred dollars ($500.00), whichever is smaller.</p>
                <p>(c) The buyer's right to restitution under subsection (b) is subject to offset to the extent that the seller establishes:</p>
                <p>(i) A right to recover damages under the provisions of this article other than subsection (a); and</p>
                <p>(ii) The amount or value of any benefits received by the buyer directly or indirectly by reason of the contract.</p>
                <p>(d) Where a seller has received payment in goods their reasonable value or the proceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection (b); but if the seller has notice of the buyer's breach before reselling goods received in part performance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this article on resale by an aggrieved seller (section 34.1-2-706).</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section and of the preceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages:</p>
                <p>(i) The agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this article, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of nonconforming goods or parts; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.</p>
                <p>(b) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this act.</p>
                <p>(c) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.</p>

                <p>(i) A right of action against the third party is in either party to the contract for sale who has title to or a security interest or a special property or an insurable interest in the goods; and if the goods have been destroyed or converted a right of action is also in the party who either bore the risk of loss under the contract for sale or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the other;</p>
                <p>(ii) If at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the contract for sale and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement is, subject to his own interest, as a fiduciary for the other party to the contract;</p>
                <p>(iii) Either party may with the consent of the other sue for the benefit of whom it may concern.</p>

                <p>(a) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four (4) years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one (1) year but may not extend it.</p>
                <p>(b) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.</p>
                <p>(c) Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (a) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six (6) months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.</p>

                <p>(a) If the court as a matter of law finds a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the lease contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the lease contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.</p>

                <p>(c) Before making a finding of unconscionability under subsection (a) or (b), the court, on its own motion or that of a party, shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the lease contract or clause thereof, or of the conduct.</p>

                <p>(ii) There is a writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a lease contract has been made between the parties and to describe the goods leased and the lease term.</p>
                <p>(b) Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (a)(ii), whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.</p>
                <p>(c) A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (a)(ii) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods shown in the writing.</p>
                <p>(d) A lease contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (a), but which is valid in other respects, is enforceable:</p>
                <p>(i) If the goods are to be specially manufactured or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for lease or sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor's business, and the lessor, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the lessee, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or</p>
                <p>(iii) With respect to goods that have been received and accepted by the lessee.</p>

                <p>(ii) If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court a lease term, the term so admitted; or</p>

                <p>(a) The benefit of a supplier's promises to the lessor under the supply contract and of all warranties, whether express or implied, including those of any third party provided in connection with or as part of the supply contract, extends to the lessee to the extent of the lessee's leasehold interest under a finance lease related to the supply contract, but is subject to the terms of the warranty and of the supply contract and all defenses or claims arising therefrom.</p>
                <p>(b) The extension of the benefit of a supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee (section 34.1-2.A-209(a)) does not: (1) modify the rights and obligations of the parties to the supply contract, whether arising therefrom or otherwise; or (2) impose any duty or liability under the supply contract on the lessee.</p>
                <p>(c) Any modification or rescission of the supply contract by the supplier and the lessor is effective between the supplier and the lessee unless, before the modification or rescission, the supplier has received notice that the lessee has entered into a finance lease related to the supply contract. If the modification or rescission is effective between the supplier and the lessee, the lessor is deemed to have assumed, in addition to the obligations of the lessor to the lessee under the lease contract, promises of the supplier to the lessor and warranties that were so modified or rescinded as they existed and were available to the lessee before modification or rescission.</p>
                <p>(d) In addition to the extension of the benefit of the supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee under subsection (a), the lessee retains all rights that the lessee may have against the supplier which arise from an agreement between the lessee and the supplier or under other law.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-2.A-210. Express warranties.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Express warranties by the lessor are created as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the lessor to the lessee which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the affirmation or promise;</p>
                <p>(ii) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the description;</p>
                <p>(iii) Any sample or model that is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to the sample or model.</p>
                <p>(b) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as "warrant" or "guarantee," or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.</p>

                <p>(a) There is in a lease contract a warranty that for the lease term no person holds a claim to or interest in the goods that arose from an act or omission of the lessor, other than a claim by way of infringement or the like, which will interfere with the lessee's enjoyment of its leasehold interest.</p>
                <p>(b) Except in a finance lease there is in a lease contract by a lessor who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind a warranty that the goods are delivered free of the rightful claim of any person by way of infringement or the like.</p>
                <p>(c) A lessee who furnishes specifications to a lessor or a supplier shall hold the lessor and the supplier harmless against any claim by way of infringement or the like that arises out of compliance with the specifications.</p>

                <p>(a) Except in a finance lease, a warranty that the goods will be merchantable is implied in a lease contract if the lessor is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.</p>
                <p>(b) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as:</p>
                <p>(i) Pass without objection in the trade under the description in the lease agreement;</p>
                <p>(ii) In the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description;</p>
                <p>(iii) Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which goods of that type are used;</p>
                <p>(iv) Run, within the variation permitted by the lease agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved;</p>
                <p>(v) Are adequately contained, packaged and labeled as the lease agreement may require; and</p>
                <p>(vi) Conform to any promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label.</p>
                <p>(c) Other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.</p>

                <p>(a) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit a warranty must be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but, subject to the provisions of section 34.1-2.A-202 on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to subsection (c), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention "merchantability," be by a writing, and be conspicuous. Subject to subsection (c), to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and be conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous and states, for example, "There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose."</p>
                <p>(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), but subject to subsection (d):</p>
                <p>(i) Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is," or "with all faults," or by other language that in common understanding calls the lessee's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty, if in writing and conspicuous;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the lessee before entering into the lease contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as desired or has refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects that an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed; and</p>
                <p>(iii) An implied warranty may also be excluded or modified by course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.</p>
                <p>(d) To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or against infringement (section 34.1-2.A-211) or any part of it, the language must be specific, be by a writing, and be conspicuous, unless the circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are being leased subject to a claim or interest of any person.</p>

                <p>(a) Warranties, whether express or implied, must be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable, the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description;</p>
                <p>(ii) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description;</p>
                <p>(iii) Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited with respect to injury to the person of an individual to whom the warranty extends, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against the beneficiary designated under this section.</p>

                <p>(ii) When the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or</p>

                <p>(a) A lessee obtains an insurable interest when existing goods are identified to the lease contract even though the goods identified are nonconforming and the lessee has an option to reject them.</p>
                <p>(b) If a lessee has an insurable interest only by reason of the lessor's identification of the goods, the lessor, until default or insolvency or notification to the lessee that identification is final, may substitute other goods for those identified.</p>
                <p>(c) Notwithstanding a lessee's insurable interest under subsections (a) and (b), the lessor retains an insurable interest until an option to buy has been exercised by the lessee and risk of loss has passed to the lessee.</p>
                <p>(d) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.</p>

                <p>(a) Except in the case of a finance lease, risk of loss is retained by the lessor and does not pass to the lessee. In the case of a finance lease, risk of loss passes to the lessee.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to the provisions of this article on the effect of default on risk of loss (section 34.1-2.A-220), if risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If the lease contract requires or authorizes the goods to be shipped by carrier:</p>
                <p>(A) And it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier; but</p>
                <p>(B) If it does require delivery at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery.</p>
                <p>(ii) If the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the lessee on acknowledgment by the bailee of the lessee's right to possession of the goods;</p>
                <p>(iii) In any case not within paragraph (i) or (ii), the risk of loss passes to the lessee on the lessee's receipt of the goods if the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the lessee on tender of delivery.</p>

                <p>(i) If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or acceptance;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as having remained with the lessor from the beginning.</p>
                <p>(b) Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage may treat the risk of loss as resting on the lessee for a commercially reasonable time.</p>

                <p>(i) If the loss is total, the lease contract is avoided; and</p>

                <p>(a) As used in this section, "creation of a security interest" includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to article 9, secured transactions, by reason of section 34.1-9-109(a)(iii).</p>
                <p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (d) and section 34.1-9-407, a provision in a lease agreement which (1) prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy, or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or (2) makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the rights and remedies provided in subsection (e), but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective.</p>
                <p>(c) A provision in a lease agreement which (1) prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's entire obligation, or (2) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection (d).</p>
                <p>(d) Subject to subsection (e) and section 34.1-9-407:</p>
                <p>(i) If a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in section 34.1-2.A-501(b);</p>
                <p>(ii) If paragraph (i) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that (1) is prohibited under a lease agreement or (2) materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract, (1) the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer and (2) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer.</p>
                <p>(e) A transfer of "the lease" or of "all my rights under the lease," or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.</p>
                <p>(f) Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default.</p>
                <p>(g) In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to section 34.1-2.A-303, a subsequent lessee from a lessor of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessor had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (b) and section 34.1-2.A-527(d), takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessor with voidable title has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith subsequent lessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence.

                <p>(ii) The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored;</p>
                <p>(iii) It was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale"; or</p>

                <p>(c) A subsequent lessee from the lessor of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this state or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-2.A-309. Lessor's and lessee's rights when goods become fixtures.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) In this section:</p>
                <p>(i) Goods are "fixtures" when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law;</p>
                <p>(ii) A "fixture filing" is the filing, in the office where a record of a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded, of a financing statement covering goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of section 34.1-9-502(a) and (b);</p>
                <p>(iii) A lease is a "purchase money lease" unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreement is enforceable;</p>
                <p>(iv) A mortgage is a "construction mortgage" to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates; and</p>
                <p>(v) "Encumbrance" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests.</p>
                <p>(b) Under this article a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</p>
                <p>(c) This article does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law.</p>
                <p>(d) The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:</p>
                <p>(i) The lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within ten (10) days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.</p>
                <p>(e) The interest of a lessor of fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:</p>
                <p>(i) The fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures the lease contract is enforceable;</p>
                <p>(ii) The conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable;</p>
                <p>(iii) The encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or</p>
                <p>(iv) The lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time.</p>
                <p>(f) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(i) but otherwise subject to subsections (d) and (e), the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.</p>
                <p>(g) In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.</p>
                <p>(h) If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (1) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this article, or (2) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.</p>
                <p>(j) Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the article on secured transactions (article 9).</p>

                <p>(a) Goods are "accessions" when they are installed in or affixed to other goods.</p>
                <p>(b) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into before the goods became accessions is superior to all interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (d).</p>
                <p>(c) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into at the time or after the goods became accessions is superior to all subsequently acquired interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (d) but is subordinate to interests in the whole existing at the time the lease contract was made unless the holders of such interests in the whole have in writing consented to the lease or disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole.</p>
                <p>(d) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract described in subsection (b) or (c) is subordinate to the interest of:</p>
                <p>(i) A buyer in the ordinary course of business or a lessee in the ordinary course of business of any interest in the whole acquired after the goods became accessions; or</p>
                <p>(ii) A creditor with a security interest in the whole perfected before the lease contract was made to the extent that the creditor makes subsequent advances without knowledge of the lease contract.</p>
                <p>(e) When under subsections (b) or (c) and (d) a lessor or a lessee of accessions holds an interest that is superior to all interests in the whole, the lessor or the lessee may (1) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease contract by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease contract and this article, or (2) if necessary to enforce his other rights and remedies under this article, remove the goods from the whole, free and clear of all interests in the whole, but he must reimburse any holder of an interest in the whole who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.</p>

                <p>(a) If either party repudiates a lease contract with respect to a performance not yet due under the lease contract, the loss of which performance will substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the other, the aggrieved party may:</p>
                <p>(i) For a commercially reasonable time, await retraction of repudiation and performance by the repudiating party;</p>
                <p>(ii) Make demand pursuant to section 34.1-2.A-401 and await assurance of future performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Resort to any right or remedy upon default under the lease contract or this article, even though the aggrieved party has notified the repudiating party that the aggrieved party would await the repudiating party's performance and assurance and has urged retraction. In addition, whether or not the aggrieved party is pursuing one of the foregoing remedies, the aggrieved party may suspend performance or, if the aggrieved party is the lessor, proceed in accordance with the provisions of this article on the lessor's right to identify goods to the lease contract notwithstanding default or to salvage unfinished goods (section 34.1-2.A-524).</p>

                <p>(b) Retraction may be by any method that clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform under the lease contract and includes any assurance demanded under section 34.1-2.A-401.</p>

                <p>(a) If without fault of the lessee, the lessor and the supplier, the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or the agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable, but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, the substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.</p>
                <p>(b) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation:</p>
                <p>(i) The lessor may withhold or stop delivery or cause the supplier to withhold or stop delivery unless the lessee provides a means or manner of payment that is commercially a substantial equivalent; and</p>
                <p>(ii) If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the lessee's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive, or predatory.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to section 34.1-2.A-404 on substituted performance, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a lessor or a supplier who complies with paragraphs (ii) and (iii) is not a default under the lease contract if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the lease contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order, whether or not the regulation or order later proves to be invalid;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the causes mentioned in paragraph (i) affect only part of the lessor's or the supplier's capacity to perform, he shall allocate production and deliveries among his customers but at his option may include regular customers not then under contract for sale or lease as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner that is fair and reasonable;</p>
                <p>(iii) The lessor seasonably shall notify the lessee and in the case of a finance lease the supplier seasonably shall notify the lessor and the lessee, if known, that there will be delay or nondelivery and, if allocation is required under paragraph (ii), of the estimated quota thus made available for the lessee.</p>

                <p>(i) Terminate the lease contract (section 34.1-2.A-505(b)); or</p>
                <p>(ii) Except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, modify the lease contract by accepting the available quota in substitution, with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deficiency but without further right against the lessor.</p>

                <p>(a) Whether the lessor or the lessee is in default under a lease contract is determined by the lease agreement and this article.</p>
                <p>(b) If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement has rights and remedies as provided in this article and, except as limited by this article, as provided in the lease agreement.</p>

                <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in section 34.1-1-305(a) or this article or the lease agreement, the rights and remedies referred to in subsections (b) and (c) are cumulative.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this article, the lease agreement may include rights and remedies for default in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this article.</p>
                <p>(b) Resort to a remedy provided under this article or in the lease agreement is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive. If circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, or provision for an exclusive remedy is unconscionable, remedy may be had as provided in this article.</p>
                <p>(c) Consequential damages may be liquidated under section 34.1-2.A-504, or may otherwise be limited, altered, or excluded unless the limitation, alteration, or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation, alteration, or exclusion of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation, alteration, or exclusion of damages where the loss is commercial is not prima facie unconscionable.</p>

                <p>(a) Damages payable by either party for default, or any other act or omission, including indemnity for loss or diminution of anticipated tax benefits or loss or damage to lessor's residual interest, may be liquidated in the lease agreement but only at an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the then anticipated harm caused by the default or other act or omission.</p>
                <p>(b) If the lease agreement provides for liquidation of damages, and such provision does not comply with subsection (a), or such provision is an exclusive or limited remedy that circumstances cause to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this article.</p>
                <p>(c) If the lessor justifiably withholds or stops delivery of goods because of the lessee's default or insolvency (section 34.1-2.A-525 or 34.1-2.A-526), the lessee is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds:</p>
                <p>(i) The amount to which the lessor is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the lessor's damages in accordance with subsection (a); or</p>
                <p>(ii) In the absence of those terms, twenty percent (20%) of the then present value of the total rent the lessee was obligated to pay for the balance of the lease term, or, in the case of a consumer lease, the lesser of such amount or five hundred dollars ($500.00).</p>
                <p>(d) A lessee's right to restitution under subsection (c) is subject to offset to the extent the lessor establishes:</p>
                <p>(i) A right to recover damages under the provisions of this article other than subsection (a); and</p>
                <p>(ii) The amount or value of any benefits received by the lessee directly or indirectly by reason of the lease contract.</p>

                <p>(a) An action for default under a lease contract, including breach of warranty or indemnity, must be commenced within four (4) years after the cause of action accrued. By the original lease contract the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one (1) year.</p>
                <p>(b) A cause of action for default accrues when the act or omission on which the default or breach of warranty is based is or should have been discovered by the aggrieved party, or when the default occurs, whichever is later. A cause of action for indemnity accrues when the act or omission on which the claim for indemnity is based is or should have been discovered by the indemnified party, whichever is later.</p>
                <p>(c) If an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (a) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same default or breach of warranty or indemnity, the other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six (6) months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.</p>

                <p>(a) Damages based on market rent (section 34.1-2.A-519 or 34.1-2.A-528) are determined according to the rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the time of the default.</p>
                <p>(b) If evidence of rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times or places described in this article is not readily available, the rent prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place or for a different lease term which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the difference, including the cost of transporting the goods to or from the other place.</p>
                <p>(c) Evidence of a relevant rent prevailing at a time or place or for a lease term other than the one described in this article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party notice the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.</p>
                <p>(d) If the prevailing rent or value of any goods regularly leased in any established market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of that market are admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of the report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to any security interest of a lessee (section 34.1-2.A-508(e)), if a lessor or a supplier has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection, a merchant lessee, after rejection of goods in his possession or control, shall follow any reasonable instructions received from the lessor or the supplier with respect to the goods. In the absence of those instructions, a merchant lessee shall make reasonable efforts to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the goods for the lessor's account if they threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.</p>
                <p>(b) If a merchant lessee (subsection (a)) or any other lessee (section 34.1-2.A-512) disposes of goods, he is entitled to reimbursement either from the lessor or the supplier or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and disposing of the goods and, if the expenses include no disposition commission, to such commission as is usual in the trade, or if there is none, to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds.</p>
                <p>(c) In complying with this section or section 34.1-2.A-512, the lessee is held only to good faith. Good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance or conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.</p>
                <p>(d) A purchaser who purchases in good faith from a lessee pursuant to this section or section 34.1-2.A-512 takes the goods free of any rights of the lessor and the supplier even though the lessee fails to comply with one (1) or more of the requirements of this article.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided with respect to goods that threaten to decline in value speedily (section 34.1-2.A-511) and subject to any security interest of a lessee (section 34.1-2.A-508(e)):</p>
                <p>(i) The lessee, after rejection of goods in the lessee's possession, shall hold them with reasonable care at the lessor's or the supplier's disposition for a reasonable time after the lessee's seasonable notification of rejection;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the lessor or the supplier gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection, the lessee may store the rejected goods for the lessor's or the supplier's account or ship them to the lessor or the supplier or dispose of them for the lessor's or the supplier's account with reimbursement in the manner provided in section 34.1-2.A-511; but</p>
                <p>(iii) The lessee has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.</p>
                <p>(b) Action by the lessee pursuant to subsection (a) is not acceptance or conversion.</p>

                <p>(a) If any tender or delivery by the lessor or the supplier is rejected because nonconforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the lessor or the supplier may seasonably notify the lessee of the lessor's or the supplier's intention to cure and may then make a conforming delivery within the time provided in the lease contract.</p>
                <p>(b) If the lessee rejects a nonconforming tender that the lessor or the supplier had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance, the lessor or the supplier may have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender if he seasonably notifies the lessee.</p>

                <p>(a) In rejecting goods, a lessee's failure to state a particular defect that is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes the lessee from relying on the defect to justify rejection or to establish default:</p>
                <p>(i) If, stated seasonably, the lessor or the supplier could have cured it (section 34.1-2.A-513); or</p>
                <p>(ii) Between merchants if the lessor or the supplier after rejection has made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the lessee proposes to rely.</p>
                <p>(b) A lessee's failure to reserve rights when paying rent or other consideration against documents precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent in the documents.</p>

                <p>(a) Acceptance of goods occurs after the lessee has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods and:</p>
                <p>(i) The lessee signifies or acts with respect to the goods in a manner that signifies to the lessor or the supplier that the goods are conforming or that the lessee will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The lessee fails to make an effective rejection of the goods (section 34.1-2.A-509(b)).</p>
                <p>(b) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.</p>

                <p>(a) A lessee must pay rent for any goods accepted in accordance with the lease contract, with due allowance for goods rightfully rejected or not delivered.</p>
                <p>(b) A lessee's acceptance of goods precludes rejection of the goods accepted. In the case of a finance lease, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it. In any other case, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured. Acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this article or the lease agreement for nonconformity.</p>
                <p>(c) If a tender has been accepted:</p>
                <p>(i) Within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered any default, the lessee shall notify the lessor and the supplier, if any, or be barred from any remedy against the party not notified;</p>
                <p>(ii) Except in the case of a consumer lease, within a reasonable time after the lessee receives notice of litigation for infringement or the like (section 34.1-2.A-211) the lessee shall notify the lessor or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The burden is on the lessee to establish any default.</p>
                <p>(d) If a lessee is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which a lessor or a supplier is answerable over the following apply:</p>
                <p>(i) The lessee may give the lessor or the supplier, or both, written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that if the person notified does not do so that person will be bound in any action against that person by the lessee by any determination of fact common to the two (2) litigations, then unless the person notified after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend that person is so bound;</p>
                <p>(ii) The lessor or the supplier may demand in writing that the lessee turn over control of the litigation including settlement if the claim is one for infringement or the like (section 34.1-2.A-211) or else be barred from any remedy over.</p>
                <p>If the demand states that the lessor or the supplier agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the lessee after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the lessee is so barred.</p>
                <p>(e) Subsections (c) and (d) apply to any obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or the supplier harmless against infringement or the like (section 34.1-2.A-211).</p>

                <p>(a) A lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the lessee if the lessee has accepted it:</p>
                <p>(i) Except in the case of a finance lease, on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Without discovery of the nonconformity if the lessee's acceptance was reasonably induced either by the lessor's assurances or, except in the case of a finance lease, by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance.</p>
                <p>(b) Except in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, a lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit if the lessor defaults under the lease contract and the default substantially impairs the value of that lot or commercial unit to the lessee.</p>
                <p>(c) If the lease agreement so provides, the lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit because of other defaults by the lessor.</p>
                <p>(d) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by the nonconformity. Revocation is not effective until the lessee notifies the lessor.</p>
                <p>(e) A lessee who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if the lessee had rejected them.</p>

                <p>(a) After a default by a lessor under the lease contract of the type described in section 34.1-2.A-508(a), or, if agreed, after other default by the lessor, the lessee may cover by making any purchase or lease of or contract to purchase or lease goods in substitution for those due from the lessor.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 34.1-2.A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 34.1-1-302 and 34.1-2.A-503), if a lessee's cover is by a lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessee may recover from the lessor as damages (1) the present value, as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, and (2) any incidental or consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.</p>
                <p>(c) If a lessee's cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (b), or is by purchase or otherwise, the lessee may recover from the lessor as if the lessee had elected not to cover and section 34.1-2.A-519 governs.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 34.1-2.A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 34.1-1-302 and 34.1-2.A-503), if a lessee elects not to cover or a lessee elects to cover and the cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under section 34.1-2.A-518(b), or is by purchase or otherwise, the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the lessor or for rejection or revocation of acceptance by the lessee is the present value, as of the date of the default, of the then market rent minus the present value as of the same date of the original rent, computed for the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.</p>
                <p>(b) Market rent is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise agreed, if the lessee has accepted goods and given notification (section 34.1-2.A-516(c)), the measure of damages for non-conforming tender or delivery or other default by a lessor is the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessor's default as determined in any manner that is reasonable together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.</p>
                <p>(d) Except as otherwise agreed, the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the present value at the time and place of acceptance of the difference between the value of the use of the goods accepted and the value if they had been as warranted for the lease term, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default or breach of warranty.</p>

                <p>(i) Cancel the lease contract (section 34.1-2.A-505(a));</p>
                <p>(ii) Proceed respecting goods not identified to the lease contract (section 34.1-2.A-524);</p>

                <p>(a) A lessor may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee if the lessor discovers the lessee to be insolvent and may stop delivery of carload, truckload, planeload, or larger shipments of express or freight if the lessee repudiates or fails to make a payment due before delivery, whether for rent, security or otherwise under the lease contract, or for any other reason the lessor has a right to withhold or take possession of the goods.</p>
                <p>(b) In pursuing its remedies under subsection (a), the lessor may stop delivery until:</p>
                <p>(i) Receipt of the goods by the lessee;</p>
                <p>(ii) Acknowledgment to the lessee by any bailee of the goods, except a carrier, that the bailee holds the goods for the lessee; or</p>

                <p>(c)(i) To stop delivery, a lessor shall so notify as to enable the bailee by reasonable diligence to prevent delivery of the goods;</p>
                <p>(ii) After notification, the bailee shall hold and deliver the goods according to the directions of the lessor, but the lessor is liable to the bailee for any ensuing charges or damages;</p>

                <p>(a) After a default by a lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 34.1-2.A-523(a) or 34.1-2.A-523(c)(i) or after the lessor refuses to deliver or takes possession of goods (section 34.1-2.A-525 or 34.1-2.A-526), or, if agreed, after other default by a lessee, the lessor may dispose of the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof by lease, sale, or otherwise.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 34.1-2.A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 34.1-1-302 and 34.1-2.A-503), if the disposition is by lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages (1) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, (2) the present value, as of the same date, of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value, as of the same date, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement, and (3) any incidental damages allowed under section 34.1-2.A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.</p>
                <p>(c) If the lessor's disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (b), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as if the lessor had elected not to dispose of the goods and section 34.1-2.A-528 governs.</p>
                <p>(d) A subsequent buyer or lessee who buys or leases from the lessor in good faith for value as a result of a disposition under this section takes the goods free of the original lease contract and any rights of the original lessee even though the lessor fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this article.</p>
                <p>(e) The lessor is not accountable to the lessee for any profit made on any disposition. A lessee who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance shall account to the lessor for any excess over the amount of the lessee's security interest (section 34.1-2.A-508(e)).</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 34.1-2.A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 34.1-1-302 and 34.1-2.A-503), if a lessor elects to retain the goods or a lessor elects to dispose of the goods and the disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under section 34.1-2.A-527(b), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages for a default of the type described in section 34.1-2.A-523(a) or 34.1-2.A-523(c)(i), or, if agreed, for other default of the lessee, (1) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of default if the lessee has never taken possession of the goods, or, if the lessee has taken possession of the goods, as of the date the lessor repossesses the goods or an earlier date on which the lessee makes a tender of the goods to the lessor, (2) the present value as of the date determined under clause (1) of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the market rent at the place where the goods are located computed for the same lease term, and (3) any incidental damages allowed under section 34.1-2.A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.</p>
                <p>(b) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (a) is inadequate to put a lessor in as good a position as performance would have, the measure of damages is the present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance by the lessee, together with any incidental damages allowed under section 34.1-2.A-530, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of disposition.</p>

                <p>(a) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 34.1-2.A-523(a) or 34.1-2.A-523(c)(i) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, if the lessor complies with subsection (b), the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages:</p>
                <p>(i) For goods accepted by the lessee and not repossessed by or tendered to the lessor, and for conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of loss passes to the lessee (section 34.1-2.A-219), (1) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (2) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (3) any incidental damages allowed under section 34.1-2.A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default; and</p>
                <p>(ii) For goods identified to the lease contract if the lessor is unable after reasonable effort to dispose of them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that effort will be unavailing, (1) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (2) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (3) any incidental damages allowed under section 34.1-2.A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the lessor shall hold for the lessee for the remaining lease term of the lease agreement any goods that have been identified to the lease contract and are in the lessor's control.</p>
                <p>(c) The lessor may dispose of the goods at any time before collection of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (a). If the disposition is before the end of the remaining lease term of the lease agreement, the lessor's recovery against the lessee for damages is governed by section 34.1-2.A-527 or 34.1-2.A-528, and the lessor will cause an appropriate credit to be provided against a judgment for damages to the extent that the amount of the judgment exceeds the recovery available pursuant to section 34.1-2.A-527 or 34.1-2.A-528.</p>
                <p>(d) Payment of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (a) entitles the lessee to the use and possession of the goods not then disposed of for the remaining lease term of and in accordance with the lease agreement.</p>
                <p>(e) After a lessee has wrongfully rejected or revoked acceptance of goods, has failed to pay rent then due, or has repudiated (section 34.1-2.A-402), a lessor who is held not entitled to rent under this section must nevertheless be awarded damages for non-acceptance under sections 34.1-2.A-527 and 34.1-2.A-528.</p>

                <p>(ii) "Drawee" means a person ordered in a draft to make payment;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Drawer" means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as a person ordering payment;</p>

                <p>(vii) "Ordinary care" in the case of a person engaged in business means observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in the area in which the person is located, with respect to the business in which the person is engaged.

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-3-104. Negotiable instrument.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:</p>
                <p>(i) Is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;</p>
                <p>(ii) Is payable on demand or at a definite time; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (1) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, (2) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (3) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.</p>
                <p>(b) "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.</p>
                <p>(c) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (a)(i), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.</p>
                <p>(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this article.</p>
                <p>(e) An instrument is a "note" if it is a promise and is a "draft" if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both "note" and "draft," a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.</p>
                <p>(f) "Check" means (1) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or (2) a cashier's check or teller's check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as "money order."</p>
                <p>(g) "Cashier's check" means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.</p>
                <p>(h) "Teller's check" means a draft drawn by a bank (1) on another bank, or (2) payable at or through a bank.</p>
                <p>(j) "Traveler's check" means an instrument that (1) is payable on demand, (2) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, (3) is designated by the term "traveler's check" or by a substantially similar term, and (4) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.</p>
                <p>(k) "Certificate of deposit" means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.</p>

                <p>(a) "Issue" means the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person.</p>
                <p>(b) An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.</p>
                <p>(c) "Issuer" applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-3-106. Unconditional promise or order.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as provided in this section, for the purposes of section 34.1-3-104(a), a promise or order is unconditional unless it states (1) an express condition to payment, (2) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing, or (3) that rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing. A reference to another writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.</p>
                <p>(b) A promise or order is not made conditional (1) by a reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or (2) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.</p>
                <p>(c) If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of section 34.1-3-104(a). If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.</p>
                <p>(d) If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of section 34.1-3-104(a); but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.</p>

                <p>(a) A promise or order is "payable on demand" if it (1) states that it is payable on demand or at sight, or otherwise indicates that it is payable at the will of the holder, or (2) does not state any time of payment.</p>
                <p>(b) A promise or order is "payable at a definite time" if it is payable on elapse of a definite period of time after sight or acceptance or at a fixed date or dates or at a time or times readily ascertainable at the time the promise or order is issued, subject to rights of (1) prepayment, (2) acceleration, (3) extension at the option of the holder, or (4) extension to a further definite time at the option of the maker or acceptor or automatically upon or after a specified act or event.</p>
                <p>(c) If an instrument, payable at a fixed date, is also payable upon demand made before the fixed date, the instrument is payable on demand until the fixed date and, if demand for payment is not made before that date, becomes payable at a definite time on the fixed date.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-3-110. Identification of person to whom instrument is payable.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument. The instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than one (1) person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by one (1) or more of the signers.</p>
                <p>(b) If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.</p>
                <p>(c) A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number, office, or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of an instrument, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If an instrument is payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument is payable to the person to whom the account is payable. If an instrument is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the owner of the account identified by number;</p>
                <p>(ii) If an instrument is payable to:</p>
                <p>(A) A trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether or not the beneficiary or estate is also named;</p>
                <p>(B) A person described as agent or similar representative of a named or identified person, the instrument is payable to the represented person, the representative, or a successor of the representative;</p>
                <p>(C) A fund or organization that is not a legal entity, the instrument is payable to a representative of the members of the fund or organization; or</p>
                <p>(D) An office or to a person described as holding an office, the instrument is payable to the named person, the incumbent of the office, or a successor to the incumbent.</p>
                <p>(d) If an instrument is payable to two (2) or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two (2) or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to two (2) or more persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively, the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively.</p>

                <p>(b) Interest may be stated in an instrument as a fixed or variable amount of money or it may be expressed as a fixed or variable rate or rates. The amount or rate of interest may be stated or described in the instrument in any manner and may require reference to information not contained in the instrument. If an instrument provides for interest, but the amount of interest payable cannot be ascertained from the description, interest is payable at the judgment rate in effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.</p>

                <p>(a) "Incomplete instrument" means a signed writing, whether or not issued by the signer, the contents of which show at the time of signing that it is incomplete but that the signer intended it to be completed by the addition of words or numbers.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to subsection (c), if an incomplete instrument is an instrument under section 34.1-3-104, it may be enforced according to its terms if it is not completed, or according to its terms as augmented by completion. If an incomplete instrument is not an instrument under section 34.1-3-104, but, after completion, the requirements of section 34.1-3-104 are met, the instrument may be enforced according to its terms as augmented by completion.</p>
                <p>(c) If words or numbers are added to an incomplete instrument without authority of the signer, there is an alteration of the incomplete instrument under section 34.1-3-407.</p>

                <p>(c) Except as provided in subsection (d), an action to enforce the obligation of a party to an unaccepted draft to pay the draft must be commenced within three (3) years after dishonor of the draft or ten (10) years after the date of the draft, whichever period expires first.</p>
                <p>(d) An action to enforce the obligation of the acceptor of a certified check or the issuer of a teller's check, cashier's check, or traveler's check must be commenced within three (3) years after demand for payment is made to the acceptor or issuer, as the case may be.</p>
                <p>(e) An action to enforce the obligation of a party to a certificate of deposit to pay the instrument must be commenced within six (6) years after demand for payment is made to the maker, but if the instrument states a due date and the maker is not required to pay before that date, the six (6) year period begins when a demand for payment is in effect and the due date has passed.</p>
                <p>(f) An action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an accepted draft, other than a certified check, must be commenced (1) within six (6) years after the due date or dates stated in the draft or acceptance if the obligation of the acceptor is payable at a definite time, or (2) within six (6) years after the date of the acceptance if the obligation of the acceptor is payable on demand.</p>
                <p>(g) Unless governed by other law regarding claims for indemnity or contribution, an action (1) for conversion of an instrument, for money had and received, or like action based on conversion, (2) for breach of warranty, or (3) to enforce an obligation, duty, or right arising under this article and not governed by this section must be commenced within three (3) years after the cause of action accrues.</p>

                <p>(a) An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.</p>
                <p>(b) Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.</p>
                <p>(c) Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.</p>
                <p>(d) If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under this article and has only the rights of a partial assignee.</p>

                <p>(a) "Indorsement" means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (1) negotiating the instrument, (2) restricting payment of the instrument, or (3) incurring indorser's liability on the instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than indorsement. For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.</p>
                <p>(b) "Indorser" means a person who makes an indorsement.</p>
                <p>(c) For the purpose of determining whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder, an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument.</p>
                <p>(d) If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder's name or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection.</p>

                <p>(a) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a "special indorsement." When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person. The principles stated in section 34.1-3-110 apply to special indorsements.</p>
                <p>(b) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a "blank indorsement." When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed.</p>
                <p>(c) The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable.</p>
                <p>(d) "Anomalous indorsement" means an indorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument. An anomalous indorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may be negotiated.</p>

                <p>(a) An indorsement limiting payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further transfer or negotiation of the instrument is not effective to prevent further transfer or negotiation of the instrument.</p>
                <p>(b) An indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled.</p>
                <p>(c) If an instrument bears an indorsement (1) described in section 34.1-4-201(b), or (2) in blank or to a particular bank using the words "for deposit," "for collection," or other words indicating a purpose of having the instrument collected by a bank for the indorser or for a particular account, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement;</p>
                <p>(ii) A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or takes it for collection when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement;</p>
                <p>(iii) A payor bank that is also the depositary bank or that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement;</p>
                <p>(iv) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (iii), a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the indorsement and is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are not received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.</p>
                <p>(d) Except for an indorsement covered by subsection (c), if an instrument bears an indorsement using words to the effect that payment is to be made to the indorsee as agent, trustee, or other fiduciary for the benefit of the indorser or another person, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty as provided in section 34.1-3-307, a person who purchases the instrument from the indorsee or takes the instrument from the indorsee for collection or payment may pay the proceeds of payment or the value given for the instrument to the indorsee without regard to whether the indorsee violates a fiduciary duty to the indorser;</p>
                <p>(ii) A subsequent transferee of the instrument or person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by the restriction in the indorsement unless the transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
                <p>(e) The presence on an instrument of an indorsement to which this section applies does not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under subsection</p>
                <p>(c) or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty as stated in subsection (d).</p>
                <p>(f) In an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor has a defense if payment would violate an indorsement to which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this section.</p>

A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel indorsements made after the reacquirer first became a holder of the instrument.

                <p>(a) Subject to subsection (c) and section 34.1-3-106(d), "holder in due course" means the holder of an instrument if:</p>
                <p>(i) The instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The holder took the instrument (1) for value, (2) in good faith, (3) without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series, (4) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered, (5) without notice of any claim to the instrument described in section 34.1-3-306, and (6) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in section 34.1-3-305(a).</p>
                <p>(b) Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a defense under subsection (a), but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument.</p>
                <p>(c) Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken (1) by legal process or by purchase in an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor's sale or similar proceeding, (2) by purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business of the transferor, or (3) as the successor in interest to an estate or other organization.</p>
                <p>(d) If, under section 34.1-3-303(a)(i), the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has been partially performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised performance.</p>
                <p>(e) If (1) the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the instrument and (2) the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.</p>
                <p>(f) To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity to act on it.</p>

                <p>(ii) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained by judicial proceeding;</p>
                <p>(iii) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim against any person, whether or not the claim is due;</p>
                <p>(iv) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument;</p>
                <p>(v) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable obligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument; or</p>

                <p>(ii) If the instrument is a check, ninety (90) days after its date; or</p>

                <p>(i) If the principal is payable in installments and a due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue upon default under the instrument for nonpayment of an installment, and the instrument remains overdue until the default is cured;</p>

                <p>(c) Unless the due date of principal has been accelerated, an instrument does not become overdue if there is default in payment of interest but no default in payment of principal.</p>

                <p>(iii) A claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument; but the claim of the obligor may be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.</p>
                <p>(b) The right of a holder in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (a)(i), but is not subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (a)(ii) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection (a)(iii) against a person other than the holder.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as stated in subsection (d), in an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor may not assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument (section 34.1-3-306) of another person, but the other person's claim to the instrument may be asserted by the obligor if the other person is joined in the action and personally asserts the claim against the person entitled to enforce the instrument. An obligor is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the instrument does not have rights of a holder in due course and the obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument.</p>
                <p>(d) In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the accommodation party may assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under subsection</p>
                <p>(a) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy, and lack of legal capacity.</p>

                <p>(a) In this section:</p>
                <p>(i) "Fiduciary" means an agent, trustee, partner, corporate officer or director, or other representative owing a fiduciary duty with respect to an instrument;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Represented person" means the principal, beneficiary, partnership, corporation, or other person to whom the duty stated in paragraph (i) is owed.</p>
                <p>(b) If (1) an instrument is taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection or for value, (2) the taker has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, and (3) the represented person makes a claim to the instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Notice of breach of fiduciary duty by the fiduciary is notice of the claim of the represented person;</p>
                <p>(ii) In the case of an instrument payable to the represented person or the fiduciary as such, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (1) taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary, (2) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (3) deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person;</p>
                <p>(iii) If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, and made payable to the fiduciary personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach of fiduciary duty unless the taker knows of the breach of fiduciary duty;</p>
                <p>(iv) If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, to the taker as payee, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (1) taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary, (2) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (3) deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.</p>

                <p>(a) In an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under section 34.1-3-402(a).</p>
                <p>(b) If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection (a), a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under section 34.1-3-301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.</p>

                <p>(a) A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (1) the person was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred, (2) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure, and (3) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.</p>
                <p>(b) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection (a) must prove the terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If that proof is made, section 34.1-3-308 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.</p>

                <p>(a) Unless otherwise agreed, if a certified check, cashier's check, or teller's check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation. Discharge of the obligation does not affect any liability that the obligor may have as an indorser of the instrument.</p>
                <p>(b) Unless otherwise agreed and except as provided in subsection (a), if a note or an uncertified check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken, and the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) In the case of an uncertified check, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or until it is paid or certified. Payment or certification of the check results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the amount of the check;</p>
                <p>(ii) In the case of a note, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid. Payment of the note results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the payment;</p>
                <p>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (iv), if the check or note is dishonored and the obligee of the obligation for which the instrument was taken is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligee may enforce either the instrument or the obligation. In the case of an instrument of a third person which is negotiated to the obligee by the obligor, discharge of the obligor on the instrument also discharges the obligation;</p>
                <p>(iv) If the person entitled to enforce the instrument taken for an obligation is a person other than the obligee, the obligee may not enforce the obligation to the extent the obligation is suspended. If the obligee is the person entitled to enforce the instrument but no longer has possession of it because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, the obligation may not be enforced to the extent of the amount payable on the instrument, and to that extent the obligee's rights against the obligor are limited to enforcement of the instrument.</p>
                <p>(c) If an instrument other than one described in subsection (a) or (b) is taken for an obligation, the effect is (1) that stated in subsection (a) if the instrument is one on which a bank is liable as maker or acceptor, or (2) that stated in subsection (b) in any other case.</p>

                <p>(a) If a person against whom a claim is asserted proves that (1) that person in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim, (2) the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute, and (3) the claimant obtained payment of the instrument, the following subsections apply.</p>
                <p>(b) Unless subsection (c) applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.</p>
                <p>(c) Subject to subsection (d), a claim is not discharged under subsection (b) if either of the following applies:</p>
                <p>(i) The claimant, if an organization, proves that (1) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office, or place, and (2) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received by that designated person, office, or place;</p>
                <p>(ii) The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that within ninety (90) days after payment of the instrument, the claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against whom the claim is asserted. This paragraph does not apply if the claimant is an organization that sent a statement complying with paragraph (i).</p>
                <p>(d) A claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.</p>

                <p>(a) In this section:</p>
                <p>(i) "Check" means a cashier's check, teller's check or certified check;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Claimant" means a person who claims the right to receive the amount of a cashier's check, teller's check or certified check that was lost, destroyed or stolen;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Declaration of loss" means a statement, made in a record under penalty of perjury, to the effect that:</p>
                <p>(A) The declarer lost possession of a check;</p>
                <p>(B) The declarer is the drawer or payee of the check, in the case of a certified check, or the remitter or payee of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check;</p>
                <p>(C) The loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the declarer or a lawful seizure; and</p>
                <p>(D) The declarer cannot reasonably obtain possession of the check because the check was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.</p>
                <p>(iv) "Obligated bank" means the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check or the acceptor of a certified check.</p>
                <p>(b) A claimant may assert a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank describing the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of the check, if:</p>
                <p>(i) The claimant is the drawer or payee of a certified check or the remitter or payee of a cashier's check or teller's check;</p>
                <p>(ii) The communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration of loss of the claimant with respect to the check;</p>
                <p>(iii) The communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act on it before the check is paid; and</p>
                <p>(iv) The claimant provides reasonable identification if requested by the obligated bank.</p>
                <p>(c) Delivery of a declaration of loss is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration. If a claim is asserted in compliance with subsection (b) of this section, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) The claim becomes enforceable at the later of:</p>
                <p>(A) The time the claim is asserted;</p>
                <p>(B) The ninetieth (90th) day following the date of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check; or</p>
                <p>(C) The ninetieth (90th) day following the date of the acceptance, in the case of a certified check.</p>
                <p>(ii) Until the claim becomes enforceable, it has no legal effect and the obligated bank may pay the check or, in the case of a teller's check, may permit the drawee to pay the check. Payment to a person entitled to enforce the check discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check;</p>
                <p>(iii) If the claim becomes enforceable before the check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not obliged to pay the check;</p>
                <p>(iv) When the claim becomes enforceable, the obligated bank becomes obliged to pay the amount of the check to the claimant if payment of the check has not been made to a person entitled to enforce the check. Subject to W.S. 34.1-4-302(a)(i), payment to the claimant discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check.</p>
                <p>(d) If the obligated bank pays the amount of a check to a claimant under paragraph (c)(iv) of this section and the check is presented for payment by a person having rights of a holder in due course, the claimant is obliged to:</p>
                <p>(i) Refund the payment to the obligated bank if the check is paid; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Pay the amount of the check to the person having rights of a holder in due course if the check is dishonored.</p>
                <p>(e) If a claimant has the right to assert a claim under subsection (b) of this section and is also a person entitled to enforce a cashier's check, teller's check or certified check which is lost, destroyed or stolen, the claimant may assert rights with respect to the check either under this section or W.S. 34.1-3-309.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-3-402. Signature by representative.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing either the name of the represented person or the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature to the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were on a simple contract. If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the "authorized signature of the represented person" and the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified in the instrument.</p>
                <p>(b) If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If the form of the signature shows unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the represented person who is identified in the instrument, the representative is not liable on the instrument;</p>
                <p>(ii) Subject to subsection (c), if (1) the form of the signature does not show unambiguously that the signature is made in a representative capacity or (2) the represented person is not identified in the instrument, the representative is liable on the instrument to a holder in due course that took the instrument without notice that the representative was not intended to be liable on the instrument. With respect to any other person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that the original parties did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.</p>
                <p>(c) If a representative signs the name of the representative as drawer of a check without indication of the representative status and the check is payable from an account of the represented person who is identified on the check, the signer is not liable on the check if the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person.</p>

                <p>(ii) An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</p>
                <p>(c) Under subsection (a) or (b), an indorsement is made in the name of a payee if (1) it is made in a name substantially similar to that of the payee or (2) the instrument, whether or not indorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the payee.</p>
                <p>(d) With respect to an instrument to which subsection (a) or (b) applies, if a person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</p>

                <p>(a) In this section:</p>
                <p>(i) "Employee" includes an independent contractor and employee of an independent contractor retained by the employer;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Fraudulent indorsement" means (1) in the case of an instrument payable to the employer, a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the employer, or (2) in the case of an instrument with respect to which the employer is the issuer, a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the person identified as payee;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Responsibility" with respect to instruments means authority (1) to sign or indorse instruments on behalf of the employer, (2) to process instruments received by the employer for bookkeeping purposes, for deposit to an account, or for other disposition, (3) to prepare or process instruments for issue in the name of the employer, (4) to supply information determining the names or addresses of payees of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, (5) to control the disposition of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, or (6) to act otherwise with respect to instruments in a responsible capacity. "Responsibility" does not include authority that merely allows an employee to have access to instruments or blank or incomplete instrument forms that are being stored or transported or are part of incoming or outgoing mail, or similar access.</p>
                <p>(b) For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a person who, in good faith, pays an instrument or takes it for value or for collection, if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in the name of that person. If the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</p>
                <p>(c) Under subsection (b), an indorsement is made in the name of the person to whom an instrument is payable if (1) it is made in a name substantially similar to the name of that person or (2) the instrument, whether or not indorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to the name of that person.</p>

                <p>(a) A person whose failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to an alteration of an instrument or to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting the alteration or the forgery against a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</p>
                <p>(b) Under subsection (a), if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss, the loss is allocated between the person precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</p>
                <p>(c) Under subsection (a), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person asserting the preclusion. Under subsection (b), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person precluded.</p>

                <p>(a) "Alteration" means (1) an unauthorized change in an instrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party, or (2) an unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), an alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. No other alteration discharges a party, and the instrument may be enforced according to its original terms.</p>
                <p>(c) A payor bank or drawee paying a fraudulently altered instrument or a person taking it for value, in good faith and without notice of the alteration, may enforce rights with respect to the instrument (1) according to its original terms, or (2) in the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed.</p>

                <p>(a) "Acceptance" means the drawee's signed agreement to pay a draft as presented. It must be written on the draft and may consist of the drawee's signature alone. Acceptance may be made at any time and becomes effective when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted draft is delivered for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.</p>
                <p>(b) A draft may be accepted although it has not been signed by the drawer, is otherwise incomplete, is overdue, or has been dishonored.</p>
                <p>(c) If a draft is payable at a fixed period after sight and the acceptor fails to date the acceptance, the holder may complete the acceptance by supplying a date in good faith.</p>
                <p>(d) "Certified check" means a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn. Acceptance may be made as stated in subsection (a) or by a writing on the check which indicates that the check is certified. The drawee of a check has no obligation to certify the check, and refusal to certify is not dishonor of the check.</p>

                <p>(a) If the terms of a drawee's acceptance vary from the terms of the draft as presented, the holder may refuse the acceptance and treat the draft as dishonored. In that case, the drawee may cancel the acceptance.</p>
                <p>(b) The terms of a draft are not varied by an acceptance to pay at a particular bank or place in the United States, unless the acceptance states that the draft is to be paid only at that bank or place.</p>
                <p>(c) If the holder assents to an acceptance varying the terms of a draft, the obligation of each drawer and indorser that does not expressly assent to the acceptance is discharged.</p>

                <p>(a) In this section, "obligated bank" means the acceptor of a certified check or the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check bought from the issuer.</p>
                <p>(b) If the obligated bank wrongfully (1) refuses to pay a cashier's check or certified check, (2) stops payment of a teller's check, or (3) refuses to pay a dishonored teller's check, the person asserting the right to enforce the check is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the nonpayment and may recover consequential damages if the obligated bank refuses to pay after receiving notice of particular circumstances giving rise to the damages.</p>
                <p>(c) Expenses or consequential damages under subsection (b) are not recoverable if the refusal of the obligated bank to pay occurs because (1) the bank suspends payments, (2) the obligated bank asserts a claim or defense of the bank that it has reasonable grounds to believe is available against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, (3) the obligated bank has a reasonable doubt whether the person demanding payment is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, or (4) payment is prohibited by law.</p>

                <p>(a) The acceptor of a draft is obliged to pay the draft (1) according to its terms at the time it was accepted, even though the acceptance states that the draft is payable "as originally drawn" or equivalent terms, (2) if the acceptance varies the terms of the draft, according to the terms of the draft as varied, or (3) if the acceptance is of a draft that is an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 34.1-3-115 and 34.1-3-407. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the draft or to the drawer or an indorser who paid the draft under section 34.1-3-414 or 34.1-3-415.</p>
                <p>(b) If the certification of a check or other acceptance of a draft states the amount certified or accepted, the obligation of the acceptor is that amount. If (1) the certification or acceptance does not state an amount, (2) the amount of the instrument is subsequently raised, and (3) the instrument is then negotiated to a holder in due course, the obligation of the acceptor is the amount of the instrument at the time it was taken by the holder in due course.</p>

                <p>(a) This section does not apply to cashier's checks or other drafts drawn on the drawer.</p>

                <p>(d) If a draft is accepted and the acceptor is not a bank, the obligation of the drawer to pay the draft if the draft is dishonored by the acceptor is the same as the obligation of an indorser under section 34.1-3-415(a) and (c).</p>
                <p>(e) If a draft states that it is drawn "without recourse" or otherwise disclaims liability of the drawer to pay the draft, the drawer is not liable under subsection (b) to pay the draft if the draft is not a check. A disclaimer of the liability stated in subsection (b) is not effective if the draft is a check.</p>
                <p>(f) If (1) a check is not presented for payment or given to a depositary bank for collection within thirty (30) days after its date, (2) the drawee suspends payments after expiration of the thirty (30) day period without paying the check, and (3) because of the suspension of payments, the drawer is deprived of funds maintained with the drawee to cover payment of the check, the drawer to the extent deprived of funds may discharge its obligation to pay the check by assigning to the person entitled to enforce the check the rights of the drawer against the drawee with respect to the funds.</p>

                <p>(iii) The instrument has not been altered;</p>

                <p>(a) If an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft, (1) the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and (2) a previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee making payment or accepting the draft in good faith that:</p>
                <p>(i) The warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft;</p>
                <p>(ii) The draft has not been altered; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer of the draft is unauthorized.</p>

In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft, breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor. If the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection.</p>
                <p>(c) If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) based on an unauthorized indorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective under section 34.1-3-404 or 34.1-3-405 or the drawer is precluded under section 34.1-3-406 or 34.1-4-406 from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration.</p>
                <p>(d) If (1) a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or (2) any other instrument is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the instrument, and (3) payment is received, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) The person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the instrument warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the instrument, a person entitled to enforce the instrument or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the instrument;</p>

                <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (c), if the drawee of a draft pays or accepts the draft and the drawee acted on the mistaken belief that (1) payment of the draft had not been stopped pursuant to section 34.1-4-403 or (2) the signature of the drawer of the draft was authorized, the drawee may recover the amount of the draft from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made or, in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance. Rights of the drawee under this subsection are not affected by failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in paying or accepting the draft.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), if an instrument has been paid or accepted by mistake and the case is not covered by subsection (a), the person paying or accepting may, to the extent permitted by the law governing mistake and restitution, (1) recover the payment from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made or (2) in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.</p>
                <p>(c) The remedies provided by subsection (a) or (b) may not be asserted against a person who took the instrument in good faith and for value or who in good faith changed position in reliance on the payment or acceptance. This subsection does not limit remedies provided by section 34.1-3-417 or 34.1-4-407.</p>
                <p>(d) Notwithstanding section 34.1-4-215, if an instrument is paid or accepted by mistake and the payor or acceptor recovers payment or revokes acceptance under subsection (a) or (b), the instrument is deemed not to have been paid or accepted and is treated as dishonored, and the person from whom payment is recovered has rights as a person entitled to enforce the dishonored instrument.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-3-419. Instruments signed for accommodation.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If an instrument is issued for value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument ("accommodated party") and another party to the instrument ("accommodation party") signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party "for accommodation."</p>
                <p>(b) An accommodation party may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor, or indorser and, subject to subsection (d), is obliged to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs. The obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for the accommodation.</p>
                <p>(c) A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to the instrument. Except as provided in section 34.1-3-605, the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.</p>
                <p>(d) If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if (1) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied, (2) the other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding, (3) the other party cannot be served with process, or (4) it is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.</p>
                <p>(e) An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party. An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.</p>

                <p>(a) The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by (1) the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or (2) a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.</p>
                <p>(b) In an action under subsection (a), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument.</p>
                <p>(c) A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.</p>

                <p>(a) "Presentment" means a demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled to enforce an instrument (1) to pay the instrument made to the drawee or a party obliged to pay the instrument or, in the case of a note or accepted draft payable at a bank, to the bank, or (2) to accept a draft made to the drawee.</p>
                <p>(b) The following rules are subject to article 4, agreement of the parties, and clearing-house rules and the like:</p>
                <p>(i) Presentment may be made at the place of payment of the instrument and must be made at the place of payment if the instrument is payable at a bank in the United States; may be made by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written, or electronic communication; is effective when the demand for payment or acceptance is received by the person to whom presentment is made; and is effective if made to any one (1) of two (2) or more makers, acceptors, drawees, or other payors;</p>
                <p>(ii) Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is made, the person making presentment must (1) exhibit the instrument, (2) give reasonable identification and, if presentment is made on behalf of another person, reasonable evidence of authority to do so, and (3) sign a receipt on the instrument for any payment made or surrender the instrument if full payment is made;</p>
                <p>(iii) Without dishonoring the instrument, the party to whom presentment is made may (1) return the instrument for lack of a necessary indorsement, or (2) refuse payment or acceptance for failure of the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties, or other applicable law or rule;</p>
                <p>(iv) The party to whom presentment is made may treat presentment as occurring on the next business day after the day of presentment if the party to whom presentment is made has established a cut-off hour not earlier than 2:00 p.m. for the receipt and processing of instruments presented for payment or acceptance and presentment is made after the cut-off hour.</p>

                <p>(a) Dishonor of a note is governed by the following rules:</p>
                <p>(i) If the note is payable on demand, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made to the maker and the note is not paid on the day of presentment;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the note is not payable on demand and is payable at or through a bank or the terms of the note require presentment, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made and the note is not paid on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later;</p>
                <p>(iii) If the note is not payable on demand and paragraph (ii) does not apply, the note is dishonored if it is not paid on the day it becomes payable.</p>
                <p>(b) Dishonor of an unaccepted draft other than a documentary draft is governed by the following rules:</p>
                <p>(i) If a check is duly presented for payment to the payor bank otherwise than for immediate payment over the counter, the check is dishonored if the payor bank makes timely return of the check or sends timely notice of dishonor or nonpayment under section 34.1-4-301 or 34.1-4-302, or becomes accountable for the amount of the check under section 34.1-4-302;</p>
                <p>(ii) If a draft is payable on demand and paragraph</p>
                <p>(i) does not apply, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment;</p>
                <p>(iii) If a draft is payable on a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if (1) presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later, or (2) presentment for acceptance is duly made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment;</p>
                <p>(iv) If a draft is payable on elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance, the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance is duly made and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.</p>
                <p>(c) Dishonor of an unaccepted documentary draft occurs according to the rules stated in subsection (b)(ii), (iii), and (iv), except that payment or acceptance may be delayed without dishonor until no later than the close of the third business day of the drawee following the day on which payment or acceptance is required by those paragraphs.</p>
                <p>(d) Dishonor of an accepted draft is governed by the following rules:</p>
                <p>(i) If the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the draft is not payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.</p>
                <p>(e) In any case in which presentment is otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused under section 34.1-3-504, dishonor occurs without presentment if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid.</p>
                <p>(f) If a draft is dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft was not made and the person entitled to demand acceptance consents to a late acceptance, from the time of acceptance the draft is treated as never having been dishonored.</p>

                <p>(b) Notice of dishonor may be given by any person; may be given by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written, or electronic communication; and is sufficient if it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument has been dishonored or has not been paid or accepted. Return of an instrument given to a bank for collection is sufficient notice of dishonor.</p>
                <p>(c) Subject to section 34.1-3-504(c), with respect to an instrument taken for collection by a collecting bank, notice of dishonor must be given (1) by the bank before midnight of the next banking day following the banking day on which the bank receives notice of dishonor of the instrument, or (2) by any other person within thirty (30) days following the day on which the person receives notice of dishonor.

                <p>(b) Notice of dishonor is excused if (1) by the terms of the instrument notice of dishonor is not necessary to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, or (2) the party whose obligation is being enforced waived notice of dishonor. A waiver of presentment is also a waiver of notice of dishonor.</p>

                <p>(b) A protest is a certificate of dishonor made by a United States consul or vice consul, or a notarial officer or other person authorized to administer oaths by the law of the place where dishonor occurs. It may be made upon information satisfactory to that person. The protest must identify the instrument and certify either that presentment has been made or, if not made, the reason why it was not made, and that the instrument has been dishonored by nonacceptance or nonpayment. The protest may also certify that notice of dishonor has been given to some or all parties.</p>

                <p>(b) Discharge, under section 34.1-3-604, of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the discharged party.</p>
                <p>(c) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension discharges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the extent the indorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.</p>
                <p>(d) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse. The loss suffered by the indorser or accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse.</p>
                <p>(e) If the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is secured by an interest in collateral and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent (1) the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse of the party asserting discharge, or (2) the reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the interest. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.</p>
                <p>(f) If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of any party who is jointly and severally liable with respect to the secured obligation is discharged to the extent the impairment causes the party asserting discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to pay, taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had not occurred. If the party asserting discharge is an accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection (e), the party is deemed to have a right to contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a right to reimbursement. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.</p>
                <p>(g) Under subsection (e) or (f), impairing value of an interest in collateral includes (1) failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral, (2) release of collateral without substitution of collateral of equal value, (3) failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of collateral owed, under article 9 or other law, to a debtor or surety or other person secondarily liable, or (4) failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of collateral.</p>
                <p>(h) An accommodation party is not discharged under subsection (c), (d), or (e) unless the person entitled to enforce the instrument knows of the accommodation or has notice under section 34.1-3-419(c) that the instrument was signed for accommodation.</p>
                <p>(j) A party is not discharged under this section if (1) the party asserting discharge consents to the event or conduct that is the basis of the discharge, or (2) the instrument or a separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section either specifically or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral.</p>

                <p>(a) The effect of the provisions of this article may be varied by agreement, but the parties to the agreement cannot disclaim the responsibility of a bank, or a registered clearing corporation with respect to a user or participant with whom the registered clearing corporation has a contractual relationship, for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure.

                <p>(d) The specification of [or] approval of certain procedures by this article is not disapproval of other procedures that may be reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
                <p>(e) The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care. If there is also bad faith it includes any other damages the party suffered as a proximate consequence.</p>

                <p>(b) If an item states that it is "payable at" a bank identified in the item, the item is equivalent to a draft drawn on the bank.</p>
                <p>(c) If a draft names a nonbank drawee and it is unclear whether a bank named in the draft is a co-drawee or a collecting bank, the bank is a collecting bank.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4-201. Status of collecting bank as agent and provisional status of credits; applicability of article; item indorsed "pay any bank".</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Unless a contrary intent clearly appears and before the time that a settlement given by a collecting bank for an item is or becomes final, the bank, with respect to the item, is an agent or subagent of the owner of the item and any settlement given for the item is provisional. This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of recoupment or setoff. If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this article apply even though action of the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.</p>
                <p>(b) After an item has been indorsed with the words "pay any bank" or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been:</p>
                <p>(i) Returned to the customer initiating collection;</p>
                <p>or</p>
                <p>(ii) Specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.</p>

                <p>(a) A collecting bank must exercise ordinary care in:</p>
                <p>(i) Presenting an item or sending it for presentment;</p>
                <p>(ii) Sending notice of dishonor or nonpayment or returning an item other than a documentary draft to the bank's transferor after learning that the item has not been paid or accepted, as the case may be;</p>
                <p>(iii) Settling for an item when the bank receives final settlement; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit within a reasonable time after discovery thereof.</p>
                <p>(b) A collecting bank exercises ordinary care under subsection (a) by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following receipt of an item, notice, or settlement. Taking proper action within a reasonably longer time may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of establishing timeliness.</p>
                <p>(c) Subject to subsection (a)(i), a bank is not liable for the insolvency, neglect, misconduct, mistake, or default of another bank or person or for loss or destruction of an item in the possession of others or in transit.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4-207. Transfer warranties.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that:</p>
                <p>(i) The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item;</p>
                <p>(ii) All signatures on the item are authentic and authorized;</p>
                <p>(iii) The item has not been altered;</p>
                <p>(iv) The item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment (section 34.1-3-305(a)) of any party that can be asserted against the warrantor; and</p>
                <p>(v) The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer.</p>
                <p>(b) If an item is dishonored, a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item (1) according to the terms of the item at the time it was transferred, or (2) if the transfer was of an incomplete item, according to its terms when completed as stated in sections 34.1-3-115 and 34.1-3-407. The obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith. A transferor cannot disclaim its obligation under this subsection by an indorsement stating that it is made "without recourse" or otherwise disclaiming liability.</p>
                <p>(c) A person to whom the warranties under subsection (a) are made and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a result of the breach.</p>
                <p>(d) The warranties stated in subsection (a) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty (30) days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.</p>
                <p>(e) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.</p>

                <p>(a) If an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft, (1) the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and (2) a previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in good faith that:</p>
                <p>(i) The warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft;</p>
                <p>(ii) The draft has not been altered; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the purported drawer of the draft is unauthorized.</p>
                <p>(b) A drawee making payment may recover from a warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer because of the payment. In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft (1) breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor, and (2) if the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from a warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection.</p>
                <p>(c) If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) based on an unauthorized indorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective under section 34.1-3-404 or 34.1-3-405 or the drawer is precluded under section 34.1-3-406 or 34.1-4-406 from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration.</p>
                <p>(d) If (1) a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or (2) any other item is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the item, and the item is paid, the person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the item warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the item, a person entitled to enforce the item or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the item. The person making payment may recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.</p>
                <p>(e) The warranties stated in subsections (a) and (d) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty (30) days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.</p>
                <p>(f) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.</p>

                <p>(a) A collecting bank has a security interest in an item and any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either:</p>
                <p>(i) In case of an item deposited in an account, to the extent to which credit given for the item has been withdrawn or applied;</p>
                <p>(ii) In case of an item for which it has been given credit available for withdrawal as of right, to the extent of the credit given, whether or not the credit is drawn upon or there is a right of charge-back; or</p>
                <p>(iii) If it makes an advance on or against the item.</p>
                <p>(b) If credit given for several items received at one (1) time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or applied in part, the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either. For the purpose of this section, credits first given are first withdrawn.</p>
                <p>(c) Receipt by a collecting bank of a final settlement for an item is a realization on its security interest in the item, accompanying documents, and proceeds. So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or possession or control of the accompanying documents for purposes other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to article 9, but:</p>
                <p>(i) No security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable (section 34.1-9-203);</p>
                <p>(ii) No filing is required to perfect the security interest; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The security interest has priority over conflicting perfected security interests in the item, accompanying documents, or proceeds.</p>

                <p>(a) Unless otherwise instructed, a collecting bank may present an item not payable by, through, or at a bank by sending to the party to accept or pay a written notice that the bank holds the item for acceptance or payment. The notice must be sent in time to be received on or before the day when presentment is due and bank must meet any requirement of the party to accept or pay under section 34.1-3-501 by the close of the bank's next banking day after it knows of the requirement.</p>

                <p>(a) With respect to settlement by a bank, the medium and time of settlement may be prescribed by Federal Reserve regulations or circulars, clearing-house rules, and the like, or agreement. In the absence of such prescription:</p>
                <p>(i) The medium of settlement is cash or credit to an account in a Federal Reserve Bank of or specified by the person to receive settlement; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The time of settlement, is:</p>
                <p>(A) With respect to tender of settlement by cash, a cashier's check, or teller's check, when the cash or check is sent or delivered;</p>
                <p>(B) With respect to tender of settlement by credit in an account in a Federal Reserve Bank, when the credit is made;</p>
                <p>(C) With respect to tender of settlement by a credit or debit to an account in a bank, when the credit or debit is made or, in the case of tender of settlement by authority to charge an account, when the authority is sent or delivered; or</p>
                <p>(D) With respect to tender of settlement by a funds transfer, when payment is made pursuant to section 34.1-4.A-406(a) to the person receiving settlement.</p>
                <p>(b) If the tender of settlement is not by a medium authorized by subsection (a) or the time of settlement is not fixed by subsection (a), no settlement occurs until the tender of settlement is accepted by the person receiving settlement.</p>
                <p>(c) If settlement for an item is made by cashier's check or teller's check and the person receiving settlement, before its midnight deadline:</p>
                <p>(i) Presents or forwards the check for collection, settlement is final when the check is finally paid; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Fails to present or forward the check for collection, settlement is final at the midnight deadline of the person receiving settlement.</p>
                <p>(d) If settlement for an item is made by giving authority to charge the account of the bank giving settlement in the bank receiving settlement, settlement is final when the charge is made by the bank receiving settlement if there are funds available in the account for the amount of the item.</p>

                <p>(a) If a collecting bank has made provisional settlement with its customer for an item and fails by reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a bank, or otherwise to receive a settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge-back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer's account, or obtain refund from its customer, whether or not it is able to return the item, if by its midnight deadline or within a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends notification of the facts. If the return or notice is delayed beyond the bank's midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts, the bank may revoke the settlement, charge-back the credit, or obtain refund from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay. These rights to revoke, charge-back, and obtain refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final.</p>
                <p>(b) A collecting bank returns an item when it is sent or delivered to the bank's customer or transferor or pursuant to its instructions.</p>
                <p>(c) A depositary bank that is also the payor may charge-back the amount of an item to its customer's account or obtain refund in accordance with the section governing return of an item received by a payor bank for credit on its books (section 34.1-4-301).</p>
                <p>(d) The right to charge-back is not affected by:</p>
                <p>(i) Previous use of a credit given for the item; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Failure by any bank to exercise ordinary care with respect to the item, but a bank so failing remains liable.</p>
                <p>(e) A failure to charge-back or claim refund does not affect other rights of the bank against the customer or any other party.</p>
                <p>(f) If credit is given in dollars as the equivalent of the value of an item payable in foreign money, the dollar amount of any charge-back or refund must be calculated on the basis of the bank-offered spot rate for the foreign money prevailing on the day when the person entitled to the charge-back or refund learns that it will not receive payment in ordinary course.</p>

                <p>(a) An item is finally paid by a payor bank when the bank has first done any of the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Paid the item in cash;</p>
                <p>(ii) Settled for the item without having a right to revoke the settlement under statute, clearing-house rule, or agreement; or</p>

                <p>(b) If provisional settlement for an item does not become final, the item is not finally paid.</p>
                <p>(c) If provisional settlement for an item between the presenting and payor banks is made through a clearing-house or by debits or credits in an account between them, then to the extent that provisional debits or credits for the item are entered in accounts between the presenting and payor banks or between the presenting and successive prior collecting banks seriatim, they become final upon final payment of the item by the payor bank.</p>

                <p>(i) If the bank has received a provisional settlement for the item, when the settlement becomes final and the bank has had a reasonable time to receive return of the item and the item has not been received within that time;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the bank is both the depositary bank and the payor bank, and the item is finally paid, at the opening of the bank's second banking day following receipt of the item.</p>
                <p>(f) Subject to applicable law stating a time for availability of funds and any right of a bank to apply a deposit to an obligation of the depositor, a deposit of money becomes available for withdrawal as of right at the opening of the bank's next banking day after receipt of the deposit.</p>

The notice is effective for the period stated in section 34.1-4-403(b) for stop-payment orders, and must be received at such time and in such manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with respect to the check described in section 34.1-4-303. If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its act. The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 34.1-4-402.</p>
                <p>(d) A bank that in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer according to:</p>
                <p>(i) The original terms of the altered item; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed unless the bank has notice that the completion was improper.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4-402. Bank's liability to customer for wrongful dishonor; time of determining insufficiency of account.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a payor bank wrongfully dishonors an item if it dishonors an item that is properly payable, but a bank may dishonor an item that would create an overdraft unless it has agreed to pay the overdraft.</p>
                <p>(b) A payor bank is liable to its customer for damages proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor of an item. Liability is limited to actual damages proved and may include damages for an arrest or prosecution of the customer or other consequential damages. Whether any consequential damages are proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor is a question of fact to be determined in each case.</p>
                <p>(c) A payor bank's determination of the customer's account balance on which a decision to dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is based may be made at any time between the time the item is received by the payor bank and the time that the payor bank returns the item or gives notice in lieu of return, and no more than one (1) determination need be made. If, at the election of the payor bank, a subsequent balance determination is made for the purpose of reevaluating the bank's decision to dishonor the item, the account balance at that time is determinative of whether a dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is wrongful.</p>

                <p>(a) A customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than one (1) person may stop payment of any item drawn on the customer's account or close the account by an order to the bank describing the item or account with reasonable certainty received at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in section 34.1-4-303. If the signature of more than one (1) person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.</p>
                <p>(b) A stop-payment order is effective for six (6) months, but it lapses after fourteen (14) calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in writing within that period. A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional six-month periods by a writing given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective.</p>
                <p>(c) The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer. The loss from payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 34.1-4-402.</p>

                <p>(a) A payor or collecting bank's authority to accept, pay, or collect an item or to account for proceeds of its collection, if otherwise effective, is not rendered ineffective by incompetence of a customer of either bank existing at the time the item is issued or its collection is undertaken if the bank does not know of an adjudication of incompetence. Neither death nor incompetence of a customer revokes the authority to accept, pay, collect, or account until the bank knows of the fact of death or of an adjudication of incompetence and has reasonable opportunity to act on it.</p>
                <p>(b) Even with knowledge, a bank may for ten (10) days after the date of death pay or certify checks drawn on or before that date unless ordered to stop payment by a person claiming an interest in the account.</p>

                <p>(a) A bank that sends or makes available to a customer a statement of account showing payment of items for the account shall either return or make available to the customer the items paid or provide information in the statement of account sufficient to allow the customer reasonably to identify the items paid. The statement of account provides sufficient information if the item is described by item number, amount, and date of payment.</p>
                <p>(b) If the items are not returned to the customer, the person retaining the items shall either retain the items or, if the items are destroyed, maintain the capacity to furnish legible copies of the items until the expiration of seven (7) years after receipt of the items. A customer may request an item from the bank that paid the item, and the bank must provide in a reasonable time either the item or, if the item has been destroyed or is not otherwise obtainable, a legible copy of the item.</p>
                <p>(c) If a bank sends or makes available a statement of account or items pursuant to subsection (a), the customer must exercise reasonable promptness in examining the statement or the items to determine whether any payment was not authorized because of an alteration of an item or because a purported signature by or on behalf of the customer was not authorized. If, based on the statement or items provided, the customer should reasonably have discovered the unauthorized payment, the customer must promptly notify the bank of the relevant facts.</p>
                <p>(d) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties imposed on the customer by subsection (c), the customer is precluded from asserting against the bank:</p>
                <p>(i) The customer's unauthorized signature or any alteration on the item, if the bank also proves that it suffered a loss by reason of the failure; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The customer's unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in good faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the customer of the unauthorized signature or alteration and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable period of time, not exceeding thirty (30) days, in which to examine the item or statement of account and notify the bank.</p>
                <p>(e) If subsection (d) applies and the customer proves that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, the loss is allocated between the customer precluded and the bank asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of the customer to comply with subsection (c) and the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. If the customer proves that the bank did not pay the item in good faith, the preclusion under subsection (d) does not apply.</p>
                <p>(f) Without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not within one (1) year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subsection (a)) discover and report the customer's unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration. If there is a preclusion under this subsection, the payor bank may not recover for breach of warranty under section 34.1-4-208 with respect to the unauthorized signature or alteration to which the preclusion applies.</p>

                <p>(b) However, the presenting bank is under no obligation with respect to goods represented by the documents except to follow any reasonable instructions seasonably received; it has a right to reimbursement for any expense incurred in following any reasonable instructions and to prepayment of or indemnity for those expenses.</p>

                <p>(a) The time of receipt of a payment order or communication cancelling or amending a payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice stated in section 34.1-1-202. A receiving bank may fix a cutoff time or times on a funds-transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications cancelling or amending payment orders. Different cutoff times may apply to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments, or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments. A cutoff time may apply to senders generally or different cutoff times may apply to different senders or categories of payment orders. If a payment order or communication cancelling or amending a payment order is received after the close of a funds-transfer business day or after the appropriate cutoff time on a funds-transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order or communication as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business day.</p>
                <p>(b) If this article refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds-transfer business day, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this article.</p>

                <p>"Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (1) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the customer, or (2) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.</p>

                <p>(a) A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.</p>
                <p>(b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (1) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (2) the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.</p>
                <p>(c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (1) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (2) the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer.</p>
                <p>(d) The term "sender" in this article includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (a), or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b).</p>
                <p>(e) This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.</p>
                <p>(f) Except as provided in this section and in section 34.1-4.A-203(a)(i), rights and obligations arising under this section or section 34.1-4.A-203 may not be varied by agreement.</p>

                <p>(i) By express written agreement, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order;</p>
                <p>(ii) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (1) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or (2) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like.</p>

However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding ninety (90) days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the customer on account of a failure by the customer to give notification as stated in this section.</p>

                <p>(a) If an accepted payment order was transmitted pursuant to a security procedure for the detection of error and the payment order (1) erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender, (2) erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender, or (3) was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If the sender proves that the sender or a person acting on behalf of the sender pursuant to section 34.1-4.A-206 complied with the security procedure and that the error would have been detected if the receiving bank had also complied, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent stated in paragraphs (ii) and (iii);</p>
                <p>(ii) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of an erroneous payment order described in clause (1) or (3) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order and the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution;</p>
                <p>(iii) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order described in clause (2) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent the amount received by the beneficiary is greater than the amount intended by the sender. In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</p>
                <p>(b) If (1) the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (a) is not obliged to pay all or part of the order, and (2) the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding ninety (90) days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender. If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is liable to the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order.</p>

If there is a discrepancy between the terms of the payment order transmitted to the system and the terms of the payment order transmitted by the system to the bank, the terms of the payment order of the sender are those transmitted by the system.

                <p>(a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.</p>
                <p>(b) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.</p>
                <p>(c) If (1) a payment order described in subsection (b) is accepted, (2) the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (3) the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(i), the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.</p>
                <p>(d) In a case governed by subsection (b)(i), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c), the originator has the right to recover;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the right to recover.</p>

                <p>(a) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number:</p>
                <p>(i) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank;</p>
                <p>(ii) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.</p>
                <p>(b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons:</p>
                <p>(i) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (b)(i), as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates;</p>
                <p>(iii) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person;</p>
                <p>(iv) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in section 34.1-4.A-302(a)(i).</p>

                <p>(i) When the bank (1) pays the beneficiary as stated in section 34.1-4.A-405(a) or 34.1-4.A-405(b), or (2) notifies the beneficiary of receipt of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has been credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with respect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of payment from the sender of the order;</p>
                <p>(ii) When the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sender's order pursuant to section 34.1-4.A-403(a)(i) or 34.1-4.A-403(a)(ii); or</p>
                <p>(iii) The opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the bank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered by a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment from the sender, unless the order was rejected before that time or is rejected within (1) one hour after that time, or (2) one hour after the opening of the next business day of the sender following the payment date if that time is later. If notice of rejection is received by the sender after the payment date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the payment date to the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not accepted, counting that day as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest payable is reduced accordingly.</p>
                <p>(c) Acceptance of a payment order cannot occur before the order is received by the receiving bank. Acceptance does not occur under subsection (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) if the beneficiary of the payment order does not have an account with the receiving bank, the account has been closed, or the receiving bank is not permitted by law to receive credits for the beneficiary's account.</p>
                <p>(d) A payment order issued to the originator's bank cannot be accepted until the payment date if the bank is the beneficiary's bank, or the execution date if the bank is not the beneficiary's bank. If the originator's bank executes the originator's payment order before the execution date or pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order before the payment date and the payment order is subsequently canceled pursuant to section 34.1-4.A-211(b), the bank may recover from the beneficiary any payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4.A-210. Rejection of payment order.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, (1) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and (2) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.</p>
                <p>(b) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to section 34.1-4.A-211(d) or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly.</p>
                <p>(c) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.</p>
                <p>(d) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order.</p>

                <p>(a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writing. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the sender cancelling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order.</p>
                <p>(c) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank:</p>
                <p>(i) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made;</p>
                <p>(ii) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order (1) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, (2) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator, or (3) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator. If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</p>
                <p>(d) An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.</p>
                <p>(e) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time.</p>
                <p>(f) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.</p>
                <p>(g) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.</p>
                <p>(h) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (c)(ii).</p>

                <p>Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in section 34.1-4.A-209, and liability is limited to that provided in this article. A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this article or by express agreement.</p>

                <p>(a) A payment order is "executed" by the receiving bank when it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by the bank. A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed.</p>
                <p>(b) "Execution date" of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order. The execution date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received. If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4.A-302. Obligations of receiving bank in execution of payment order.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) through (d), if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to section 34.1-4.A-209(a), the bank has the following obligations in executing the order:</p>
                <p>(i) The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning (1) any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or (2) the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer. If the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator. An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly. If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible.</p>
                <p>(b) Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may (1) use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances, and (2) issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank. A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer.</p>
                <p>(c) Unless subsection (a)(ii) applies or the receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances. If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by transmitting its payment order by a particular means, the receiving bank may issue its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated.</p>
                <p>(d) Unless instructed by the sender, (1) the receiving bank may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges, and (2) may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner.</p>

                <p>(a) A receiving bank that (1) executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount greater than the amount of the sender's order, or (2) issues a payment order in execution of the sender's order and then issues a duplicate order, is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 34.1-4.A-402(c) if that subsection is otherwise satisfied. The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</p>
                <p>(b) A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 34.1-4.A-402(c) if (1) that subsection is otherwise satisfied and (2) the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order. If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order. This subsection does not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses pursuant to instruction of the sender.</p>
                <p>(c) If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they issued. The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</p>

If the sender fails to perform that duty, the bank is not obliged to pay interest on any amount refundable to the sender under section 34.1-4.A-402(d) for the period before the bank learns of the execution error. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the sender on account of a failure by the sender to perform the duty stated in this section.</p>

                <p>(a) If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of section 34.1-4.A-302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable.</p>
                <p>(b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of section 34.1-4.A-302 results in (1) noncompletion of the funds transfer, (2) failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (3) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (a), resulting from the improper execution.

Additional damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank, but are not otherwise recoverable.</p>
                <p>(e) Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (a) or (b) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.

                <p>(a) This section is subject to sections 34.1-4.A-205 and 34.1-4.A-207.</p>
                <p>(b) With respect to a payment order issued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the payment date of the order.</p>
                <p>(c) This subsection is subject to subsection (e) and to section 34.1-4.A-303. With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.</p>
                <p>(d) If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided in sections 34.1-4.A-204 and 34.1-4.A-304, interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment.</p>
                <p>(e) If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection (c) and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection (d) but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in section 34.1-4.A-302(a)(i), to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection (d).</p>
                <p>(f) The right of the sender of a payment order to be excused from the obligation to pay the order as stated in subsection (c) or to receive refund under subsection (d) may not be varied by agreement.</p>

                <p>(i) If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a Federal Reserve Bank or through a funds-transfer system;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the sender is a bank and the sender (1) credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender, or (2) caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact;</p>
                <p>(iii) If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account.</p>
                <p>(b) If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised.</p>
                <p>(c) If two banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under section 34.1-4.A-402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank. To the extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other.</p>
                <p>(d) In a case not covered by subsection (a), the time when payment of the sender's obligation under section 34.1-4.A-402(b) or 34.1-4.A-402(c) occurs is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4.A-404. Obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Subject to sections 34.1-4.A-211(e), 34.1-4.A-405(d), and 34.1-4.A-405(e), if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order. Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment.</p>
                <p>(b) If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. If the payment order does not instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney's fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.</p>
                <p>(c) The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection (a) may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule. The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection (b) may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule if the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4.A-405. Payment by beneficiary's bank to beneficiary.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If the beneficiary's bank credits an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, payment of the bank's obligation under section 34.1-4.A-404(a) occurs when and to the extent (1) the beneficiary is notified of the right to withdraw the credit, (2) the bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary, or (3) funds with respect to the order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank.</p>
                <p>(b) If the beneficiary's bank does not credit an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the bank's obligation under section 34.1-4.A-404(a) occurs is governed by principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as stated in subsections (d) and (e), if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a condition to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable.</p>
                <p>(d) A funds-transfer system rule may provide that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfers made through the system are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the payment order it accepted. A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (1) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, (2) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and (3) the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted. If the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under section 34.1-4.A-406.</p>
                <p>(e) This subsection applies to a funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that (1) nets obligations multilaterally among participants, and (2) has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations. If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, (1) the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, (2) the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, (3) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under section 34.1-4.A-406, and (4) subject to section 34.1-4.A-402(e), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under section 34.1-4.A-402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4.A-406. Payment by originator to beneficiary; discharge of underlying obligation.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Subject to sections 34.1-4.A-211(e), 34.1-4.A-405(d), and 34.1-4.A-405(e), the originator of a funds transfer pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order (1) at the time a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary is accepted by the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer and (2) in an amount equal to the amount of the order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, but not more than the amount of the originator's order.</p>
                <p>(b) If payment under subsection (a) is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless (1) the payment under subsection</p>
                <p>(a) was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, (2) the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary's bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary's refusal of the payment, (3) funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary, and (4) the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract. If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary's bank under section 34.1-4.A-404(a).</p>
                <p>(c) For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under subsection (b), if the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator's payment order less charges of one (1) or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator's order unless upon demand by the beneficiary the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges.</p>
                <p>(d) Rights of the originator or of the beneficiary of a funds transfer under this section may be varied only by agreement of the originator and the beneficiary.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this article, the rights and obligations of a party to a funds transfer may be varied by agreement of the affected party.</p>
                <p>(b) "Funds-transfer system rule" means a rule of an association of banks (1) governing transmission of payment orders by means of a funds-transfer system of the association or rights and obligations with respect to those orders, or (2) to the extent the rule governs rights and obligations between banks that are parties to a funds transfer in which a Federal Reserve Bank, acting as an intermediary bank, sends a payment order to the beneficiary's bank. Except as otherwise provided in this article, a funds-transfer system rule governing rights and obligations between participating banks using the system may be effective even if the rule conflicts with this article and indirectly affects another party to the funds transfer who does not consent to the rule. A funds-transfer system rule may also govern rights and obligations of parties other than participating banks using the system to the extent stated in sections 34.1-4.A-404(c), 34.1-4.A-405(d), and 34.1-4.A-507(c).</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-4.A-502. Creditor process served on receiving bank; setoff by beneficiary's bank.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) As used in this section, "creditor process" means levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration, or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account.</p>
                <p>(b) This subsection applies to creditor process with respect to an authorized account of the sender of a payment order if the creditor process is served on the receiving bank. For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts the payment order the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order.</p>
                <p>(c) If a beneficiary's bank has received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account. The amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank or may be applied to satisfy creditor process served on the bank with respect to the account;</p>
                <p>(ii) The bank may credit the beneficiary's account and allow withdrawal of the amount credited unless creditor process with respect to the account is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act to prevent withdrawal;</p>
                <p>(iii) If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process.</p>
                <p>(d) Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owed by that bank to the beneficiary. Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process.</p>

                <p>(a) If, under this article, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined (1) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank, or (2) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system.</p>
                <p>(b) If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (a), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable federal funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable federal funds rate is the average of the federal funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The federal funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.</p>

                <p>(a) The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or subsection (c) applies:</p>
                <p>(i) The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located;</p>
                <p>(ii) The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located;</p>
                <p>(iii) The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.</p>
                <p>(b) If the parties described in each paragraph of subsection (a) have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(c) A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern (1) rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system, or (2) the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (1) is binding on participating banks. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (2) is binding on the originator, other sender, or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender, or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order. The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system. The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue.</p>
                <p>(d) In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under subsection (b) and a choice-of-law rule under subsection (c), the agreement under subsection (b) prevails.</p>
                <p>(e) If a funds transfer is made by use of more than one (1) funds-transfer system and there is inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of the systems, the matter in issue is governed by the law of the selected jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the matter in issue.</p>

                <p>(a) This article applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations arising out of transactions involving letters of credit.</p>
                <p>(b) The statement of a rule in this article does not by itself require, imply, or negate application of the same or a different rule to a situation not provided for, or to a person not specified, in this article.</p>
                <p>(c) With the exception of this subsection, subsections (a) and (d) of this section, W.S. 34.1-5-102(a)(ix) and (x), 34.1-5-106(d) and 34.1-5-114(d), and except to the extent prohibited in W.S. 34.1-1-302 and 34.1-5-117(d), the effect of this article may be varied by agreement or by a provision stated or incorporated by reference in an undertaking. A term in an agreement or undertaking generally excusing liability or generally limiting remedies for failure to perform obligations is not sufficient to vary obligations prescribed by this article.</p>
                <p>(d) Rights and obligations of an issuer to a beneficiary or a nominated person under a letter of credit are independent of the existence, performance, or nonperformance of a contract or arrangement out of which the letter of credit arises or which underlies it, including contracts or arrangements between the issuer and the applicant and between the applicant and the beneficiary.</p>

                <p>(a) A letter of credit is issued and becomes enforceable according to its terms against the issuer when the issuer sends or otherwise transmits it to the person requested to advise or to the beneficiary. A letter of credit is revocable only if it so provides.</p>
                <p>(b) After a letter of credit is issued, rights and obligations of a beneficiary, applicant, confirmer, and issuer are not affected by an amendment or cancellation to which that person has not consented except to the extent the letter of credit provides that it is revocable or that the issuer may amend or cancel the letter of credit without that consent.</p>
                <p>(c) If there is no stated expiration date or other provision that determines its duration, a letter of credit expires one (1) year after its stated date of issuance or, if none is stated, after the date on which it is issued.</p>
                <p>(d) A letter of credit that states that it is perpetual expires five (5) years after its stated date of issuance, or if none is stated, after the date on which it is issued.</p>

                <p>(a) A confirmer is directly obligated on a letter of credit and has the rights and obligations of an issuer to the extent of its confirmation. The confirmer also has rights against and obligations to the issuer as if the issuer were an applicant and the confirmer had issued the letter of credit at the request and for the account of the issuer.</p>
                <p>(b) A nominated person who is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or otherwise give value for a presentation.</p>
                <p>(c) A person requested to advise may decline to act as an adviser. An adviser that is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or give value for a presentation. An adviser undertakes to the issuer and to the beneficiary accurately to advise the terms of the letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice received by that person and undertakes to the beneficiary to check the apparent authenticity of the request to advise. Even if the advice is inaccurate, the letter of credit, confirmation, or amendment is enforceable as issued.</p>
                <p>(d) A person who notifies a transferee beneficiary of the terms of a letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice has the rights and obligations of an adviser under subsection</p>
                <p>(c) of this section. The terms in the notice to the transferee beneficiary may differ from the terms in any notice to the transferor beneficiary to the extent permitted by the letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice received by the person who so notifies.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 34.1-5-109, an issuer shall honor a presentation that, as determined by the standard practice referred to in subsection (e) of this section, appears on its face strictly to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 34.1-5-113 and unless otherwise agreed with the applicant, an issuer shall dishonor a presentation that does not appear so to comply.</p>
                <p>(b) An issuer has a reasonable time after presentation, but not beyond the end of the seventh business day of the issuer after the day of its receipt of documents:</p>
                <p>(i) To honor;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the letter of credit provides for honor to be completed more than seven (7) business days after presentation, to accept a draft or incur a deferred obligation; or</p>
                <p>(iii) To give notice to the presenter of discrepancies in the presentation.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, an issuer is precluded from asserting as a basis for dishonor any discrepancy if timely notice is not given, or any discrepancy not stated in the notice if timely notice is given.</p>
                <p>(d) Failure to give the notice specified in subsection (b) of this section or to mention fraud, forgery, or expiration in the notice does not preclude the issuer from asserting as a basis for dishonor, fraud or forgery as described in W.S. 34.1-5-109(a) or expiration of the letter of credit before presentation.</p>
                <p>(e) An issuer shall observe standard practice of financial institutions that regularly issue letters of credit. The court shall offer the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence of the standard practice.</p>
                <p>(f) An issuer is not responsible for:</p>
                <p>(i) The performance or nonperformance of the underlying contract, arrangement or transaction;</p>
                <p>(ii) An act or omission of others; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Observance or knowledge of the usage of a particular trade other than the standard practice referred to in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p>(g) If an undertaking constituting a letter of credit under W.S. 34.1-5-102(a)(x) contains nondocumentary conditions, an issuer shall disregard the nondocumentary conditions and treat them as if they were not stated.</p>
                <p>(h) An issuer that has dishonored a presentation shall return the documents or hold them at the disposal of, and send advice to that effect to, the presenter.</p>
                <p>(j) An issuer that has honored a presentation as permitted or required by this article:</p>
                <p>(i) Is entitled to be reimbursed by the applicant in immediately available funds not later than the date of its payment of funds;</p>
                <p>(ii) Takes the documents free of claims of the beneficiary or presenter;</p>
                <p>(iii) Is precluded from asserting a right of recourse on a draft under W.S. 34.1-3-414 and 34.1-3-415;</p>
                <p>(iv) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 34.1-5-110 and 34.1-5-117, is precluded from restitution of money paid or other value given by mistake to the extent the mistake concerns discrepancies in the documents or tender which are apparent on the face of the presentation; and</p>
                <p>(v) Is discharged to the extent of its performance under the letter of credit unless the issuer honored a presentation in which a required signature of a beneficiary was forged.</p>

                <p>(a) If a presentation is made that appears on its face strictly to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit, but a required document is forged or materially fraudulent, or honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant:</p>
                <p>(i) The issuer shall honor the presentation, if honor is demanded by (1) a nominated person who has given value in good faith and without notice of forgery or material fraud, (2) a confirmer who has honored its confirmation in good faith, (3) a holder in due course of a draft drawn under the letter of credit which was taken after acceptance by the issuer or nominated person, or (4) an assignee of the issuer's or nominated person's deferred obligation that was taken for value and without notice of forgery or material fraud after the obligation was incurred by the issuer or nominated person; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The issuer, acting in good faith, may honor or dishonor the presentation in any other case.</p>
                <p>(b) If an applicant claims that a required document is forged or materially fraudulent or that honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant, a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation or grant similar relief against the issuer or other persons only if the court finds that:</p>
                <p>(i) The relief is not prohibited under the law applicable to an accepted draft or deferred obligation incurred by the issuer;</p>
                <p>(ii) A beneficiary, issuer, or nominated person who may be adversely affected is adequately protected against loss that it may suffer because the relief is granted;</p>

                <p>(iv) On the basis of the information submitted to the court, the applicant is more likely than not to succeed under its claim of forgery or material fraud and the person demanding honor does not qualify for protection under paragraph (a)(i) of this section.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-5-111. Remedies.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors or repudiates its obligation to pay money under a letter of credit before presentation, the beneficiary, successor, or nominated person presenting on its own behalf may recover from the issuer the amount that is the subject of the dishonor or repudiation. If the issuer's obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant's election, recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer. In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant's recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document.</p>
                <p>(b) If an issuer wrongfully dishonors a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit or honors a draft or demand in breach of its obligation to the applicant, the applicant may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach.</p>
                <p>(c) If an adviser or nominated person other than a confirmer breaches an obligation under this article or an issuer breaches an obligation not covered in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, a person to whom the obligation is owed may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, less any amount saved as a result of the breach. To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the liability of an issuer specified in this subsection and subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) An issuer, nominated person, or adviser who is found liable under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall pay interest on the amount owed thereunder from the date of wrongful dishonor or other appropriate date.</p>
                <p>(e) Reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses of litigation shall be awarded to the prevailing plaintiff in an action in which a remedy is sought under this article.</p>
                <p>(f) Damages that would otherwise be payable by a party for breach of an obligation under this article may be liquidated by agreement or undertaking, but only in an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the harm anticipated.</p>

                <p>(a) A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents, and receive payment or other items of value in the name of the beneficiary without disclosing its status as a successor.</p>
                <p>(b) A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents, and receive payment or other items of value in its own name as the disclosed successor of the beneficiary. Except as otherwise provided in subsection</p>
                <p>(e) of this section, an issuer shall recognize a disclosed successor of a beneficiary as beneficiary in full substitution for its predecessor upon compliance with the requirements for recognition by the issuer of a transfer of drawing rights by operation of law under the standard practice referred to in W.S. 34.1-5-108(e) or, in the absence of such a practice, compliance with other reasonable procedures sufficient to protect the issuer.</p>
                <p>(c) An issuer is not obliged to determine whether a purported successor is a successor of a beneficiary or whether the signature of a purported successor is genuine or authorized.</p>
                <p>(d) Honor of a purported successor's apparently complying presentation under subsection (a) or (b) of this section has the consequences specified in W.S. 34.1-5-108(j) even if the purported successor is not the successor of a beneficiary. Documents signed in the name of the beneficiary or of a disclosed successor by a person who is neither the beneficiary nor the successor of the beneficiary are forged documents for the purposes of W.S. 34.1-5-109.</p>
                <p>(e) An issuer whose rights of reimbursement are not covered by subsection (d) of this section or substantially similar law and any confirmer or nominated person may decline to recognize a presentation under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(f) A beneficiary whose name is changed after the issuance of a letter of credit has the same rights and obligations as a successor of a beneficiary under this section.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-5-114. Assignment of proceeds.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) In this section, "proceeds of a letter of credit" means the cash, check, accepted draft, or other item of value paid or delivered upon honor or giving of value by the issuer or any nominated person under the letter of credit. The term does not include a beneficiary's drawing rights or documents presented by the beneficiary.</p>
                <p>(b) A beneficiary may assign its right to part or all of the proceeds of a letter of credit. The beneficiary may do so before presentation as a present assignment of its right to receive proceeds contingent upon its compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.</p>
                <p>(c) An issuer or nominated person need not recognize an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit until it consents to the assignment.</p>
                <p>(d) An issuer or nominated person has no obligation to give or withhold its consent to an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit, but consent may not be unreasonably withheld if the assignee possesses and exhibits the letter of credit and presentation of the letter of credit is a condition to honor.</p>
                <p>(e) Rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person are independent of the beneficiary's assignment of the proceeds of a letter of credit and are superior to the assignee's right to the proceeds.</p>
                <p>(f) Neither the rights recognized by this section between an assignee and an issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person nor the issuer's or nominated person's payment of proceeds to an assignee or a third person affect the rights between the assignee and any person other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person. The mode of creating and perfecting a security interest in or granting an assignment of a beneficiary's rights to proceeds is governed by article 9 or other law. Against persons other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary, or nominated person, the rights and obligations arising upon the creation of a security interest or other assignment of a beneficiary's right to proceeds and its perfection are governed by article 9 or other law.</p>

                <p>(a) The liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in the form of a record signed or otherwise authenticated by the affected parties in the manner provided in W.S. 34.1-5-104 or by a provision in the person's letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.</p>
                <p>(b) Unless subsection (a) of this section applies, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is considered to be located at the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If more than one (1) address is indicated, the person is considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued. For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under this subsection.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made subject. If (1) this article would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, (2) the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice, and (3) there is conflict between this article and those rules as applied to that undertaking, those rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvariable provisions specified in W.S. 34.1-5-103(c).</p>
                <p>(d) If there is conflict between this article and article 3, 4, 4A, or 9, this article governs.</p>
                <p>(e) The forum for settling disputes arising out of an undertaking within this article may be chosen in the manner and with the binding effect that governing law may be chosen in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) An issuer that honors a beneficiary's presentation is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to the same extent as if the issuer were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary and of the applicant to the same extent as if the issuer were the secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.</p>
                <p>(b) An applicant that reimburses an issuer is subrogated to the rights of the issuer against any beneficiary, presenter, or nominated person to the same extent as if the applicant were the secondary obligor of the obligations owed to the issuer and has the rights of subrogation of the issuer to the rights of the beneficiary stated in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(c) A nominated person who pays or gives value against a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit is subrogated to the rights of:</p>
                <p>(i) The issuer against the applicant to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the obligation owed to the issuer by the applicant;</p>
                <p>(ii) The beneficiary to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The applicant to same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.</p>
                <p>(d) Notwithstanding any agreement or term to the contrary, the rights of subrogation stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section do not arise until the issuer honors the letter of credit or otherwise pays and the rights in subsection (c) of this section do not arise until the nominated person pays or otherwise gives value. Until then, the issuer, nominated person, and the applicant do not derive under this section present or prospective rights forming the basis of a claim, defense, or excuse.</p>

                <p>(a) An issuer or nominated person has a security interest in a document presented under a letter of credit to the extent that the issuer or nominated person honors or gives value for the presentation.</p>
                <p>(b) So long as and to the extent that an issuer or nominated person has not been reimbursed or has not otherwise recovered the value given with respect to a security interest in a document under subsection (a) of this section, the security interest continues and is subject to article 9, but:</p>
                <p>(i) A security agreement is not necessary to make the security interest enforceable under W.S. 34.1-9-203(b)(iii);</p>
                <p>(ii) If the document is presented in a medium other than a written or other tangible medium, the security interest is perfected; and</p>
                <p>(iii) If the document is presented in a written or other tangible medium and is not a certificated security, chattel paper, a document of title, an instrument or a letter of credit, the security interest is perfected and has priority over a conflicting security interest in the document so long as the debtor does not have possession of the document.</p>

                <p>(a) This article is subject to any treaty or statute of the United States or regulatory statute of this state to the extent the treaty, statute, or regulatory statute is applicable.</p>
                <p>(b) This article does not modify or repeal any law prescribing the form or content of a document of title or the services or facilities to be afforded by a bailee, or otherwise regulating a bailee's business in respects not specifically treated in this article. However, violation of such a law does not affect the status of a document of title that otherwise is within the definition of a document of title.</p>
                <p>(c) This act modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. section 7001, et seq.) but does not modify, limit, or supersede section 101(c) of that act (15 U.S.C. section 7001(c)) or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in section 103(b) of that act (15 U.S.C. section 7003(b)).</p>
                <p>(d) To the extent there is a conflict between the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, W.S. 40-21-101 through 40-21-119, and this article, this article governs.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, a document of title is negotiable if by its terms the goods are to be delivered to bearer or to the order of a named person.</p>
                <p>(b) A document of title other than one described in subsection (a) of this section is nonnegotiable. A bill of lading that states that the goods are consigned to a named person is not made negotiable by a provision that the goods are to be delivered only against an order in a record signed by the same or another named person.</p>
                <p>(c) A document of title is nonnegotiable if, at the time it is issued, the document has a conspicuous legend, however expressed, that it is nonnegotiable.</p>

                <p>or</p>
                <p>(B) If the authoritative copy indicates that the document has been transferred, the person to which the document was most recently transferred.</p>

                <p>(b) If goods, including distilled spirits and agricultural commodities, are stored under a statute requiring a bond against withdrawal or a license for the issuance of receipts in the nature of warehouse receipts, a receipt issued for the goods is deemed to be a warehouse receipt even if issued by a person that is the owner of the goods and is not a warehouse.</p>

                <p>(a) A warehouse receipt need not be in any particular form.</p>
                <p>(b) Unless a warehouse receipt provides for each of the following, the warehouse is liable for damages caused to a person injured by its omission:</p>
                <p>(i) A statement of the location of the warehouse facility where the goods are stored;</p>
                <p>(ii) The date of issue of the receipt;</p>
                <p>(iii) The unique identification code of the receipt;</p>
                <p>(iv) A statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a named person, or to a named person or its order;</p>
                <p>(v) The rate of storage and handling charges, unless goods are stored under a field warehousing arrangement, in which case a statement of that fact is sufficient on a nonnegotiable receipt;</p>
                <p>(vi) A description of the goods or the packages containing them;</p>
                <p>(vii) The signature of the warehouse or its agent;</p>
                <p>(viii) If the receipt is issued for goods that the warehouse owns, either solely, jointly, or in common with others, a statement of the fact of that ownership; and</p>
                <p>(ix) A statement of the amount of advances made and of liabilities incurred for which the warehouse claims a lien or security interest, unless the precise amount of advances made or liabilities incurred at the time of the issue of the receipt is unknown to the warehouse or to its agent that issued the receipt, in which case a statement of the fact that advances have been made or liabilities incurred and the purpose of the advances or liabilities is sufficient.</p>
                <p>(c) A warehouse may insert in its receipt any terms that are not contrary to this act and do not impair its obligation of delivery under W.S. 34.1-7-403 or its duty of care under W.S. 34.1-7-204. Any contrary provision is ineffective.</p>

                <p>(i) The document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether all or part of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as a case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition, or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents, condition, and quality unknown," "said to contain," or words of similar import, if the indication is true; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The party or purchaser otherwise has notice of the nonreceipt or misdescription.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-7-204. Duty of care; contractual limitation of warehouse's liability.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its failure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances. Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.</p>
                <p>(b) Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not liable. Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse's liability for conversion to its own use. On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse's liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse receipt. In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the goods.</p>
                <p>(c) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement.</p>
                <p>(d) This section does not modify or repeal any law of this state that imposes a higher responsibility upon the warehouse or that invalidates a contractual limitation that would be permissible under this article.</p>

                <p>(a) A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are held and any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of any charges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage fixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not less than thirty (30) days after the warehouse gives notice. If the goods are not removed before the date specified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to W.S. 34.1-7-210.</p>
                <p>(b) If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in subsection (a) of this section and W.S. 34.1-7-210, the warehouse may specify in the notice given under subsection (a) of this section any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than one (1) week after a single advertisement or posting.</p>
                <p>(c) If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not have notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse facilities, or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.</p>
                <p>(d) A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this article upon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.</p>
                <p>(e) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under this section but shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.</p>

                <p>(b) If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in common by the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for that owner's share.

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-7-209. Lien of warehouse.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.</p>
                <p>(b) A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (a) of this section, such as for money advanced and interest. The security interest is governed by article 9.</p>
                <p>(c) A warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) of this section or a security interest under subsection (b) of this section is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good-faith purchaser for value would have been valid. However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:</p>
                <p>(i) Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with:</p>
                <p>(A) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;</p>
                <p>(B) Power to obtain delivery under W.S. 34.1-7-403; or</p>
                <p>(C) Power of disposition under W.S. 34.1-2-403, 34.1-2.A-304(b), 34.1-2.A-305(b), 34.1-9-320, 34.1-9-321(c) or other statute or rule of law; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.</p>
                <p>(d) A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under subsection (a) of this section is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit. As used in this subsection, "household goods" means furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.</p>
                <p>(e) A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-7-210. Enforcement of warehouse's lien.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a warehouse's lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefore, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.</p>
                <p>(b) A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:</p>
                <p>(i) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods shall be notified;</p>
                <p>(ii) The notification shall include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten (10) days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place;</p>
                <p>(iii) The sale shall conform to the terms of the notification;</p>
                <p>(iv) The sale shall be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or stored;</p>
                <p>(v) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale shall be published one (1) time per week for two (2) weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The advertisement shall include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale shall take place at least fifteen (15) days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement shall be posted at least ten (10) days before the sale in not fewer than six (6) conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.</p>
                <p>(c) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but shall be retained by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this article.</p>
                <p>(d) A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p>(e) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse's noncompliance with this section.</p>
                <p>(f) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.</p>
                <p>(g) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.</p>
                <p>(h) If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may be enforced in accordance with subsection (a) or (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(j) A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.</p>

                <p>(a) A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith, or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description of the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages unknown," "said to contain," "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar import, if that indication is true.</p>
                <p>(b) If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading:</p>
                <p>(i) The issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the kind and quantity if shipped in bulk; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Words such as "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar import indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods concealed in packages.</p>
                <p>(c) If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so. In that case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar import are ineffective.</p>
                <p>(d) The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper loading. However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages caused by improper loading.</p>
                <p>(e) A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in those particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer's responsibility or liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.</p>

                <p>(a) The issuer of a through bill of lading, or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, is liable to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the other person or the performing carrier of its obligation under the bill or other document. However, to the extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in territory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including matters other than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carrier may be varied by agreement of the parties.</p>
                <p>(b) If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by that person, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in its possession, to the obligation of the issuer. The person's obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liability for breach by any other person or by the issuer.</p>
                <p>(c) The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in subsection (a) of this section is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in possession of the goods when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred:</p>
                <p>(i) The amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript of judgment; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending any action commenced by any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the breach.</p>

                <p>The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of this subsection.</p>
                <p>(b) If a tangible bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts, each of which contains an identification code and is expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been delivered against any other part, the whole of the parts constitutes one (1) bill.</p>
                <p>(c) If a tangible negotiable bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and different parts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to which the first due negotiation is made prevails as to both the document of title and the goods even if any later holder may have received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carrier's obligation by surrendering its part.</p>
                <p>(d) A person that negotiates or transfers a single part of a tangible bill of lading issued in a set is liable to holders of that part as if it were the whole set.</p>
                <p>(e) The bailee shall deliver in accordance with part 4 of this title against the first presented part of a tangible bill of lading lawfully issued in a set. Delivery in this manner discharges the bailee's obligation on the whole bill.</p>

                <p>(b) Upon request of any person entitled as against a carrier to control the goods while in transit and on surrender of possession or control of any outstanding bill of lading or other receipt covering the goods, the issuer, subject to W.S. 34.1-7-105, may procure a substitute bill to be issued at any place designated in the request.</p>

                <p>(a) A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier's receipt of the goods for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges are stated, a reasonable charge.</p>
                <p>(b) A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) of this section on goods that the carrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject the goods to those charges and expenses. Any other lien under subsection (a) of this section is effective against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.</p>
                <p>(c) A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.</p>

                <p>(a) A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification shall include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.</p>
                <p>(b) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but shall be retained by the carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this article.</p>
                <p>(c) A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p>(d) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier's noncompliance with this section.</p>
                <p>(e) A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier would have been bound to deliver the goods.</p>
                <p>(f) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.</p>
                <p>(g) A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either subsection (a) of this section or the procedure set forth in W.S. 34.1-7-210(b).</p>

                <p>(a) A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances. This subsection does not affect any statute, regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused by its negligence.</p>
                <p>(b) Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation agreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation agreement if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity. However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.</p>
                <p>(c) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a transportation agreement.</p>

                <p>(a) The following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title:</p>
                <p>(i) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person, the document is negotiated by the named person's endorsement and delivery. After the named person's endorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the document's original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone;</p>
                <p>(iii) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and it is delivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated;</p>
                <p>(iv) Negotiation of the document after it has been endorsed to a named person requires endorsement by the named person and delivery;</p>
                <p>(v) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.</p>
                <p>(b) The following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:</p>
                <p>(i) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, the document is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person. Endorsement by the named person is not required to negotiate the document;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and the named person has control of the document, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated;</p>
                <p>(iii) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves taking delivery of the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.</p>
                <p>(c) Endorsement of a nonnegotiable document of title neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's rights.</p>
                <p>(d) The naming in a negotiable bill of lading of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of the bill of any interest of that person in the goods.</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to W.S. 34.1-7-205 and 34.1-7-503, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby:</p>
                <p>(i) Title to the document;</p>
                <p>(ii) Title to the goods;</p>
                <p>(iii) All rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued; and</p>
                <p>(iv) The direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods according to the terms of the document free of any defense or claim by the issuer except those arising under the terms of the document or under this article, but in the case of a delivery order, the bailee's obligation accrues only upon the bailee's acceptance of the delivery order and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any endorser will procure the acceptance of the bailee.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to W.S. 34.1-7-503, title and rights acquired by due negotiation are not defeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the document of title or by surrender of the goods by the bailee and are not impaired even if:</p>
                <p>(i) The due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of duty;</p>
                <p>(ii) Any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document or control of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion; or</p>
                <p>(iii) A previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a third person.</p>

                <p>(a) A document of title confers no right in goods against a person that before issuance of the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:</p>
                <p>(i) Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with:</p>
                <p>(A) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;</p>
                <p>(B) Power to obtain delivery under W.S. 34.1-7-403; or</p>
                <p>(C) Power of disposition under W.S. 34.1-2-403, 34.1-2.A-304(b), 34.1-2.A-305(b), 34.1-9-320, 34.1-9-321(c) or other statute or rule of law; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.</p>
                <p>(b) Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of any person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated. That title may be defeated under W.S. 34.1-7-504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.</p>
                <p>(c) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of any person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated. However, delivery by the carrier in accordance with part 4 of this title pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-7-504. Rights acquired in absence of due negotiation; effect of diversion; stoppage of delivery.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A transferee of a document of title, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, to which the document has been delivered but not duly negotiated, acquires the title and rights that its transferor had or had actual authority to convey.</p>
                <p>(b) In the case of a transfer of a nonnegotiable document of title, until but not after the bailee receives notice of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated:</p>
                <p>(i) By those creditors of the transferor which could treat the transfer as void under W.S. 34.1-2-402 or 34.1-2.A-308;</p>
                <p>(ii) By a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of the buyer's rights;</p>
                <p>(iii) By a lessee from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the lessee or received notification of the lessee's rights; or</p>
                <p>(iv) As against the bailee, by good-faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.</p>
                <p>(c) A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in a nonnegotiable bill of lading which causes the bailee not to deliver the goods to the consignee defeats the consignee's title to the goods if the goods have been delivered to a buyer in ordinary course of business or a lessee in ordinary course of business and, in any event, defeats the consignee's rights against the bailee.</p>
                <p>(d) Delivery of the goods pursuant to a nonnegotiable document of title may be stopped by a seller under W.S. 34.1-2-705 or a lessor under W.S. 34.1-2.A-526, subject to the requirements of due notification in those sections. A bailee that honors the seller's or lessor's instructions is entitled to be indemnified by the seller or lessor against any resulting loss or expense.</p>

                <p>(a) If a document of title is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court may order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may without liability to any person comply with the order. If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimant's posting security unless it finds that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control of the document is adequately protected against the loss. If the document was nonnegotiable, the court may require security. The court may also order payment of the bailee's reasonable costs and attorney's fees in any action under this subsection.</p>
                <p>(b) A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming under a missing negotiable document of title is liable to any person injured thereby. If the delivery is not in good faith, the bailee is liable for conversion. Delivery in good faith is not conversion if the claimant posts security with the bailee in an amount at least double the value of the goods at the time of posting to indemnify any person injured by the delivery which files a notice of claim within one (1) year after the delivery.</p>

The bailee may not be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to the bailee or to the court.

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-8-103. Rules for determining whether certain obligations and interests are securities or financial assets.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock company, or similar entity is a security.</p>
                <p>(b) An "investment company security" is a security. "Investment company security" means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered. Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company.</p>
                <p>(c) An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this article, or it is an investment company security. However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.</p>
                <p>(d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this article and not by article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that article. However, a negotiable instrument governed by article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.</p>
                <p>(e) An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset.</p>
                <p>(f) A commodity contract, as defined in W.S. 34.1-9-102(a)(xv), is not a security or a financial asset.</p>
                <p>(g) A document of title is not a financial asset unless section 34.1-8-102(a)(ix)(C) applies.</p>

                <p>(a) A person acquires a security or an interest therein, under this article, if:</p>
                <p>(i) The person is a purchaser to whom a security is delivered pursuant to W.S. 34.1-8-301; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The person acquires a security entitlement to the security pursuant to W.S. 34.1-8-501.</p>
                <p>(b) A person acquires a financial asset, other than a security, or an interest therein, under this article, if the person acquires a security entitlement to the financial asset.</p>
                <p>(c) A person who acquires a security entitlement to a security or other financial asset has the rights specified in Part 5, but is a purchaser of any security, security entitlement, or other financial asset held by the securities intermediary only to the extent provided in W.S. 34.1-8-503.</p>
                <p>(d) Unless the context shows that a different meaning is intended, a person who is required by other law, regulation, rule, or agreement to transfer, deliver, present, surrender, exchange, or otherwise put in the possession of another person a security or financial asset satisfies that requirement by causing the other person to acquire an interest in the security or financial asset pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) A person has notice of an adverse claim if:</p>
                <p>(i) The person knows of the adverse claim;</p>
                <p>(ii) The person is aware of facts sufficient to indicate that there is a significant probability that the adverse claim exists and deliberately avoids information that would establish the existence of the adverse claim; or</p>
                <p>(iii) The person has a duty, imposed by statute or regulation, to investigate whether an adverse claim exists, and the investigation so required would establish the existence of the adverse claim.</p>
                <p>(b) Having knowledge that a financial asset or interest therein is or has been transferred by a representative imposes no duty of inquiry into the rightfulness of a transaction and is not notice of an adverse claim. However, a person who knows that a representative has transferred a financial asset or interest therein in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.</p>
                <p>(c) An act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a security certificate or sets a date on or after which the certificate is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not itself constitute notice of an adverse claim except in the case of a transfer more than:</p>
                <p>(i) One (1) year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Six (6) months after a date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the certificate, if money was available for payment on that date.</p>
                <p>(d) A purchaser of a certificated security has notice of an adverse claim if the security certificate:</p>
                <p>(i) Whether in bearer or registered form, has been indorsed "for collection" or "for surrender" or for some other purpose not involving transfer; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Is in bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, but the mere writing of a name on the certificate is not such a statement.</p>
                <p>(e) Filing of a financing statement under article 9 is not notice of an adverse claim to a financial asset.</p>

                <p>(a) A purchaser has "control" of a certificated security in bearer form if the certificated security is delivered to the purchaser.</p>
                <p>(b) A purchaser has "control" of a certificated security in registered form if the certificated security is delivered to the purchaser, and:</p>

                <p>(ii) The certificate is registered in the name of the purchaser, upon original issue or registration of transfer by the issuer.</p>
                <p>(c) A purchaser has "control" of an uncertificated security if:</p>
                <p>(i) The uncertificated security is delivered to the purchaser; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The issuer has agreed that it will comply with instructions originated by the purchaser without further consent by the registered owner.</p>
                <p>(d) A purchaser has "control" of a security entitlement if:</p>
                <p>(i) The purchaser becomes the entitlement holder;</p>
                <p>(ii) The securities intermediary has agreed that it will comply with entitlement orders originated by the purchaser without further consent by the entitlement holder; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Another person has control of the security entitlement on behalf of the purchaser or, having previously acquired control of the security entitlement, acknowledges that it has control on behalf of the purchaser.</p>
                <p>(e) If an interest in a security entitlement is granted by the entitlement holder to the entitlement holder's own securities intermediary, the securities intermediary has control.</p>
                <p>(f) A purchaser who has satisfied the requirements of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has control, even if the registered owner in the case of subsection (c) or the entitlement holder in the case of subsection (d) retains the right to make substitutions for the uncertificated security or security entitlement, to originate instructions or entitlement orders to the issuer or securities intermediary, or otherwise to deal with the uncertificated security or security entitlement.</p>
                <p>(g) An issuer or a securities intermediary may not enter into an agreement of the kind described in paragraph (c)(ii) or (d)(ii) of this section without the consent of the registered owner or entitlement holder, but an issuer or a securities intermediary is not required to enter into such an agreement even though the registered owner or entitlement holder so directs. An issuer or securities intermediary that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another party unless requested to do so by the registered owner or entitlement holder.</p>

                <p>(ii) Creates a share, participation, or other interest in its property or in an enterprise, or undertakes an obligation, that is an uncertificated security;</p>
                <p>(iii) Directly or indirectly creates a fractional interest in its rights or property, if the fractional interest is represented by a security certificate; or</p>

                <p>(a) Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a certificated security include terms stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by reference on the certificate to another instrument, indenture, or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, to the extent the terms referred to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate. A reference under this subsection does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the security, even if the certificate expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice. The terms of an uncertificated security include those stated in any instrument, indenture, or document or in a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is issued.</p>
                <p>(b) The following rules apply if an issuer asserts that a security is not valid:</p>
                <p>(i) A security other than one issued by a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, even though issued with a defect going to its validity, is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the particular defect unless the defect involves a violation of a constitutional provision. In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than one who takes by original issue;</p>
                <p>(ii) Paragraph (i) of this subsection applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 34.1-8-205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice.</p>
                <p>(d) All other defenses of the issuer of a security, including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a certificated security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken the certificated security without notice of the particular defense.</p>
                <p>(e) This section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security "when, as and if issued" or "when distributed" in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the subject of the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or distributed.</p>
                <p>(f) If a security is held by a securities intermediary against whom an entitlement holder has a security entitlement with respect to the security, the issuer may not assert any defense that the issuer could not assert if the entitlement holder held the security directly.</p>

                <p>(i) Requires the payment of money, the delivery of a certificated security, the registration of transfer of an uncertificated security, or any of them on presentation or surrender of the security certificate, the money or security is available on the date set for payment or exchange, and the purchaser takes the security more than one (1) year after that date; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Is not covered by paragraph (i) of this subsection and the purchaser takes the security more than two (2) years after the date set for surrender or presentation or the date on which performance became due.</p>

                <p>(i) An authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or other person entrusted by the issuer with the signing of the security certificate or of similar security certificates, or the immediate preparation for signing of any of them; or</p>

                <p>(b) A complete security certificate that has been improperly altered, even if fraudulently, remains enforceable, but only according to its original terms.</p>

                <p>(ii) Another person, other than a securities intermediary, either acquires possession of the security certificate on behalf of the purchaser or, having previously acquired possession of the certificate, acknowledges that it holds for the purchaser; or</p>

                <p>(ii) Does not have notice of any adverse claim to the security; and</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-8-304. Indorsement.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) An indorsement may be in blank or special. An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer. A special indorsement specifies to whom a security is to be transferred or who has power to transfer it. A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.</p>
                <p>(b) An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.</p>
                <p>(c) An indorsement, whether special or in blank, does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the certificate on which it appears or, if the indorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the document and the certificate.</p>
                <p>(d) If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied. However, against a transferor, a transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement supplied.</p>
                <p>(e) An indorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim to the certificate, but it does not otherwise affect a right to registration that the holder possesses.</p>
                <p>(f) Unless otherwise agreed, a person making an indorsement assumes only the obligations provided in W.S. 34.1-8-108 and not an obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer.</p>

                <p>(a) A person who guarantees a signature of an indorser of a security certificate warrants that at the time of signing:</p>
                <p>(i) The signature was genuine;</p>
                <p>(ii) The signer was an appropriate person to indorse, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The signer had legal capacity to sign.</p>
                <p>(b) A person who guarantees a signature of the originator of an instruction warrants that at the time of signing:</p>
                <p>(i) The signature was genuine;</p>
                <p>(ii) The signer was an appropriate person to originate the instruction, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person, if the person specified in the instruction as the registered owner was, in fact, the registered owner, as to which fact the signature guarantor does not make a warranty; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The signer had legal capacity to sign.</p>
                <p>(c) A person who specially guarantees the signature of an originator of an instruction makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection (b) of this section and also warrants that at the time the instruction is presented to the issuer:</p>
                <p>(i) The person specified in the instruction as the registered owner of the uncertificated security will be the registered owner; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The transfer of the uncertificated security requested in the instruction will be registered by the issuer free from all liens, security interests, restrictions, and claims other than those specified in the instruction.</p>
                <p>(d) A guarantor under subsections (a) and (b) of this section or a special guarantor under subsection (c) of this section does not otherwise warrant the rightfulness of the transfer.</p>
                <p>(e) A person who guarantees an indorsement of a security certificate makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection (a) of this section and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.</p>
                <p>(f) A person who guarantees an instruction requesting the transfer of an uncertificated security makes the warranties of a special signature guarantor under subsection (c) of this section and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.</p>
                <p>(g) An issuer may not require a special guaranty of signature, a guaranty of indorsement, or a guaranty of instruction as a condition to registration of transfer.</p>
                <p>(h) The warranties under this section are made to a person taking or dealing with the security in reliance on the guaranty, and the guarantor is liable to the person for loss resulting from their breach. An indorser or originator of an instruction whose signature, indorsement, or instruction has been guaranteed is liable to a guarantor for any loss suffered by the guarantor as a result of breach of the warranties of the guarantor.</p>

                <p>(iii) Reasonable assurance is given that the indorsement or instruction is genuine and authorized (W.S. 34.1-8-402);</p>
                <p>(iv) Any applicable law relating to the collection of taxes has been complied with;</p>
                <p>(v) The transfer does not violate any restriction on transfer imposed by the issuer in accordance with W.S. 34.1-8-204;</p>
                <p>(vi) A demand that the issuer not register transfer has not become effective under W.S. 34.1-8-403, or the issuer has complied with W.S. 34.1-8-403(b) but no legal process or indemnity bond is obtained as provided in W.S. 34.1-8-403(d); and</p>
                <p>(vii) The transfer is in fact rightful or is to a protected purchaser.</p>

                <p>(i) In all cases, a guaranty of the signature of the person making an indorsement or originating an instruction including, in the case of an instruction, reasonable assurance of identity;</p>

                <p>(a) A person who is an appropriate person to make an indorsement or originate an instruction may demand that the issuer not register transfer of a security by communicating to the issuer a notification that identifies the registered owner and the issue of which the security is a part and provides an address for communications directed to the person making the demand. The demand is effective only if it is received by the issuer at a time and in a manner affording the issuer reasonable opportunity to act on it.</p>
                <p>(b) If a certificated security in registered form is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer or an instruction is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer of an uncertificated security after a demand that the issuer not register transfer has become effective, the issuer shall promptly communicate to (1) the person who initiated the demand at the address provided in the demand and (2) the person who presented the security for registration of transfer or initiated the instruction requesting registration of transfer a notification stating that:</p>
                <p>(i) The certificated security has been presented for registration of transfer or the instruction for registration of transfer of the uncertificated security has been received;</p>
                <p>(ii) A demand that the issuer not register transfer had previously been received; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The issuer will withhold registration of transfer for a period of time stated in the notification in order to provide the person who initiated the demand an opportunity to obtain legal process or an indemnity bond.</p>
                <p>(c) The period described in paragraph (b)(iii) of this section may not exceed thirty (30) days after the date of communication of the notification. A shorter period may be specified by the issuer if it is not manifestly unreasonable.</p>
                <p>(d) An issuer is not liable to a person who initiated a demand that the issuer not register transfer for any loss the person suffers as a result of registration of a transfer pursuant to an effective indorsement or instruction if the person who initiated the demand does not, within the time stated in the issuer's communication, either:</p>
                <p>(i) Obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction, or other process from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from registering the transfer; or</p>
                <p>(ii) File with the issuer an indemnity bond, sufficient in the issuer's judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar, or other agent of the issuer involved from any loss it or they may suffer by refusing to register the transfer.</p>
                <p>(e) This section does not relieve an issuer from liability for registering transfer pursuant to an indorsement or instruction that was not effective.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 34.1-8-406, an issuer is liable for wrongful registration of transfer if the issuer has registered a transfer of a security to a person not entitled to it, and the transfer was registered:</p>
                <p>(i) Pursuant to an ineffective indorsement or instruction;</p>
                <p>(ii) After a demand that the issuer not register transfer became effective under W.S. 34.1-8-403(a) and the issuer did not comply with W.S. 34.1-8-403(b);</p>
                <p>(iii) After the issuer had been served with an injunction, restraining order, or other legal process enjoining it from registering the transfer, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the issuer had a reasonable opportunity to act on the injunction, restraining order, or other legal process; or</p>
                <p>(iv) By an issuer acting in collusion with the wrongdoer.</p>
                <p>(b) An issuer that is liable for wrongful registration of transfer under subsection (a) of this section on demand shall provide the person entitled to the security with a like certificated or uncertificated security, and any payments or distributions that the person did not receive as a result of the wrongful registration. If an overissue would result, the issuer's liability to provide the person with a like security is governed by W.S. 34.1-8-210.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section or in a law relating to the collection of taxes, an issuer is not liable to an owner or other person suffering loss as a result of the registration of a transfer of a security if registration was made pursuant to an effective indorsement or instruction.</p>

                <p>(a) If an owner of a certificated security, whether in registered or bearer form, claims that the certificate has been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken, the issuer shall issue a new certificate if the owner:</p>
                <p>(i) So requests before the issuer has notice that the certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser;</p>
                <p>(ii) Files with the issuer a sufficient indemnity bond; and</p>

                <p>(b) If, after the issue of a new security certificate, a protected purchaser of the original certificate presents it for registration of transfer, the issuer shall register the transfer unless an overissue would result. In that case, the issuer's liability is governed by W.S. 34.1-8-210. In addition to any rights on the indemnity bond, an issuer may recover the new certificate from a person to whom it was issued or any person taking under that person, except a protected purchaser.</p>

                <p>(a) To the extent necessary for a securities intermediary to satisfy all security entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset, all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary are held by the securities intermediary for the entitlement holders, are not property of the securities intermediary, and are not subject to claims of creditors of the securities intermediary, except as otherwise provided in W.S. 34.1-8-511.</p>
                <p>(b) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (a) of this section is a pro rata property interest in all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary, without regard to the time the entitlement holder acquired the security entitlement or the time the securities intermediary acquired the interest in that financial asset.</p>
                <p>(c) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (a) of this section may be enforced against the securities intermediary only by exercise of the entitlement holder's rights under W.S. 34.1-8-505 through 34.1-8-508.</p>
                <p>(d) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (a) of this section may be enforced against a purchaser of the financial asset or interest therein only if: (1) insolvency proceedings have been initiated by or against the securities intermediary;</p>
                <p>(2) the securities intermediary does not have sufficient interests in the financial asset to satisfy the security entitlements of all of its entitlement holders to that financial asset; (3) the securities intermediary violated its obligations under W.S. 34.1-8-504 by transferring the financial asset or interest therein to the purchaser; and (4) the purchaser is not protected under subsection (e) of this section. The trustee or other liquidator, acting on behalf of all entitlement holders having security entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset, may recover the financial asset, or interest therein, from the purchaser. If the trustee or other liquidator elects not to pursue that right, an entitlement holder whose security entitlement remains unsatisfied has the right to recover its interest in the financial asset from the purchaser.</p>

The securities intermediary may maintain those financial assets directly or through one (1) or more other securities intermediaries.</p>
                <p>(b) Except to the extent otherwise agreed by its entitlement holder, a securities intermediary may not grant any security interests in a financial asset it is obligated to maintain pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                <p>(h) The limitation of the rules in subsections (e), (f) and (g) to transactions other than consumer-goods transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer-goods transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer-goods transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.</p>

                <p>(a) A secured party has control of electronic chattel paper if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interest in the chattel paper reliably establishes the secured party as the person to which the chattel paper was assigned.</p>
                <p>(b) A system satisfies subsection (a) of this section if the record or records comprising the chattel paper are created, stored and assigned in such a manner that:</p>

                <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a description of a security entitlement, securities account or commodity account is sufficient if it describes:</p>
                <p>(i) The collateral by those terms or as investment property; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The underlying financial asset or commodity contract.</p>
                <p>(e) A description only by type of collateral defined in this title is an insufficient description of:</p>

                <p>(a) A security interest attaches to collateral when it becomes enforceable against the debtor with respect to the collateral, unless an agreement expressly postpones the time of attachment.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) through (j), a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to the collateral only if:</p>
                <p>(i) Value has been given;</p>
                <p>(ii) The debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party; and</p>
                <p>(iii) One (1) of the following conditions is met:</p>
                <p>(A) The debtor has authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral and, if the security interest covers timber to be cut, a description of the land concerned;</p>
                <p>(B) The collateral is not a certificated security and is in the possession of the secured party under section 34.1-9-313 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement;</p>
                <p>(C) The collateral is a certificated security in registered form and the security certificate has been delivered to the secured party under section 34.1-8-301 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement; or</p>
                <p>(D) The collateral is deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic documents and the secured party has control under section 34.1-7-106, 34.1-9-104, 34.1-9-105, 34.1-9-106 or 34.1-9-107 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement.</p>
                <p>(c) Subsection (b) is subject to section 34.1-4-210 on the security interest of a collecting bank, section 34.1-5-118 on the security interest of a letter-of-credit issuer or nominated person, section 34.1-9-110 on a security interest arising under article 2 or 2A, and section 34.1-9-206 on security interests in investment property.</p>
                <p>(d) A person becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person if, by operation of law other than this article or by contract:</p>
                <p>(i) The security agreement becomes effective to create a security interest in the person's property; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The person becomes generally obligated for the obligations of the other person, including the obligation secured under the security agreement, and acquires or succeeds to all or substantially all of the assets of the other person.</p>

                <p>(i) The agreement satisfies paragraph (b)(iii) with respect to existing or after-acquired property of the new debtor to the extent the property is described in the agreement; and</p>
                <p>(ii) Another agreement is not necessary to make a security interest in the property enforceable.</p>
                <p>(f) The attachment of a security interest in collateral gives the secured party the rights to proceeds provided by section 34.1-9-315 and is also attachment of a security interest in a supporting obligation for the collateral.</p>
                <p>(g) The attachment of a security interest in a right to payment or performance secured by a security interest or other lien on personal or real property is also attachment of a security interest in the security interest, mortgage or other lien.</p>
                <p>(h) The attachment of a security interest in a securities account is also attachment of a security interest in the security entitlements carried in the securities account.</p>

                <p>(i) A security interest or agricultural lien continues in collateral notwithstanding sale, lease, license, exchange or other disposition thereof unless the secured party authorized the disposition free of the security interest or agricultural lien; and</p>
                <p>(ii) A security interest attaches to any identifiable proceeds of collateral.</p>
                <p>(b) Proceeds that are commingled with other property are identifiable proceeds:</p>
                <p>(i) If the proceeds are goods, to the extent provided by section 34.1-9-336; and</p>
                <p>(ii) If the proceeds are not goods, to the extent that the secured party identifies the proceeds by a method of tracing, including application of equitable principles, that is permitted under law other than this article with respect to commingled property of the type involved.</p>
                <p>(c) A security interest in proceeds is a perfected security interest if the security interest in the original collateral was perfected.</p>
                <p>(d) A perfected security interest in proceeds becomes unperfected on the twenty-first day after the security interest attaches to the proceeds unless:</p>
                <p>(i) The following conditions are satisfied:</p>

                <p>(a) A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in section 34.1-9-301(a)(i) or 34.1-9-305(c) remains perfected until the earliest of:</p>
                <p>(i) The time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction;</p>
                <p>(ii) The expiration of four (4) months after a change of the debtor's location to another jurisdiction; or</p>
                <p>(iii) The expiration of one (1) year after a transfer of collateral to a person that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(b) If a security interest described in subsection (a) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</p>
                <p>(c) A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods, remains continuously perfected if:</p>
                <p>(i) The collateral is located in one (1) jurisdiction and subject to a security interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction;</p>
                <p>(ii) Thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a security interest in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate of title from this state remains perfected until the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become so covered.</p>
                <p>(e) A security interest described in subsection (d) becomes unperfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable requirements for perfection under section 34.1-9-311(b) or 34.1-9-313 are not satisfied before the earlier of:</p>
                <p>(i) The time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate of title from this state; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The expiration of four (4) months after the goods had become so covered.</p>
                <p>(f) A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights or investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's jurisdiction, the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction or the commodity intermediary's jurisdiction, as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of:</p>
                <p>(i) The time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of that jurisdiction; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The expiration of four (4) months after a change of the applicable jurisdiction to another jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(g) If a security interest described in subsection (f) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or the end of the period described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</p>
                <p>(h) The following rules apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within four (4) months after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction:</p>
                <p>(i) A financing statement filed before the change pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in W.S. 34.1-9-301(a) or 34.1-9-305(c) is effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the debtor had not changed its location;</p>
                <p>(ii) If a security interest perfected by a financing statement that is effective under paragraph (i) of this subsection becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in W.S. 34.1-9-301(a) or 34.1-9-305(c) or the expiration of the four (4) month period, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</p>
                <p>(j) If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in W.S. 34.1-9-301(a) or 34.1-9-305(c) and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights before or within four (4) months after the new debtor becomes bound under W.S. 34.1-9-203(d), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the collateral had been acquired by the original debtor;</p>
                <p>(ii) A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement and which becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the expiration of the four (4) month period or the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in W.S. 34.1-9-301(a) or 34.1-9-305(c) remains perfected thereafter. A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement but which does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</p>

                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer, other than a secured party, of tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments or a certificated security takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest or agricultural lien and before it is perfected.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a lessee of goods takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien if the lessee gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest or agricultural lien and before it is perfected.</p>
                <p>(d) A licensee of a general intangible or a buyer, other than a secured party, of collateral other than tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instrument or a certificated security takes free of a security interest if the licensee or buyer gives value without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected.</p>
                <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided in sections 34.1-9-320 and 34.1-9-321, if a person files a financing statement with respect to a purchase-money security interest before or within twenty (20) days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral, the security interest takes priority over the rights of a buyer, lessee or lien creditor which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-9-322. Priorities among conflicting security interests in and agricultural liens on same collateral.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral is determined according to the following rules:</p>
                <p>(i) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection;</p>
                <p>(ii) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien;</p>
                <p>(iii) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.</p>
                <p>(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(i):</p>
                <p>(i) The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under section 34.1-9-327, 34.1-9-328, 34.1-9-329, 34.1-9-330 or 34.1-9-331 also has priority over a conflicting security interest in:</p>
                <p>(i) Subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part;</p>
                <p>(ii) Section 34.1-4-210 with respect to a security interest of a collecting bank:</p>
                <p>(A) The security interest in proceeds is perfected;</p>
                <p>(B) The proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and</p>
                <p>(C) In the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral or an account relating to the collateral.</p>
                <p>(d) Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing.</p>
                <p>(e) Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property or letter-of-credit rights.</p>

                <p>(iv) Section 34.1-9-110 with respect to a security interest arising under article 2 or 2A.</p>
                <p>(g) A perfected agricultural lien on collateral has priority over a conflicting security interest in or agricultural lien on the same collateral if the statute creating the agricultural lien so provides.</p>

                <p>(A) Under section 34.1-9-309 when it attaches;</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-9-334. Priority of security interests in fixtures and crops.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</p>
                <p>(b) This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.</p>
                <p>(c) In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.</p>
                <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:</p>
                <p>(i) The security interest is a purchase-money security interest;</p>
                <p>(ii) The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty (20) days thereafter.</p>
                <p>(e) A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</p>
                <p>(i) The debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:</p>
                <p>(A) Is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and</p>
                <p>(B) Has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner.</p>
                <p>(ii) Before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable:</p>
                <p>(A) Factory or office machines;</p>
                <p>(B) Equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or</p>
                <p>(C) Replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods.</p>
                <p>(iii) The conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article; or</p>
                <p>(iv) The security interest is:</p>
                <p>(A) Created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction; and</p>
                <p>(B) Perfected pursuant to a statute described in section 34.1-9-311(a)(ii).</p>
                <p>(f) A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</p>
                <p>(i) The encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.</p>
                <p>(g) The priority of the security interest under paragraph (f)(ii) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.</p>
                <p>(h) A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.</p>
                <p>(j) A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property.</p>
                <p>(k) Subsection (j) prevails over any inconsistent provisions of title 1, chapter 15, articles 1 and 2 and title 29, chapter 5.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-9-335. Accessions.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A security interest may be created in an accession and continues in collateral that becomes an accession.</p>
                <p>(b) If a security interest is perfected when the collateral becomes an accession, the security interest remains perfected in the collateral.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest in an accession.</p>
                <p>(d) A security interest in an accession is subordinate to a security interest in the whole which is perfected by compliance with the requirements of a certificate-of-title statute under section 34.1-9-311(b).</p>
                <p>(e) After default, subject to Part 6, a secured party may remove an accession from other goods if the security interest in the accession has priority over the claims of every person having an interest in the whole.</p>
                <p>(f) A secured party that removes an accession from other goods under subsection (e) shall promptly reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or of the other goods, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods. The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse.</p>

                <p>(a) In this section, "commingled goods" means goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that their identity is lost in a product or mass.</p>
                <p>(b) A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such. However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods.</p>
                <p>(c) If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass.</p>
                <p>(d) If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection</p>
                <p>(c) is perfected.</p>
                <p>(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c).</p>
                <p>(f) If more than one (1) security interest attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c), the following rules determine priority:</p>
                <p>(i) A security interest that is perfected under subsection (d) has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods;</p>
                <p>(ii) If more than one (1) security interest is perfected under subsection (d), the security interests rank equally in proportion to value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods.</p>

                <p>(a) If, while a security interest in goods is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction, this state issues a certificate of title that does not show that the goods are subject to the security interest or contain a statement that they may be subject to security interests not shown on the certificate:</p>
                <p>(i) A buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate and without knowledge of the security interest; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under section 34.1-9-311(b), after issuance of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest.</p>

                <p>(i) The security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to a conflicting perfected security interest in the collateral to the extent that the holder of the conflicting security interest gives value in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information; and</p>
                <p>(ii) A purchaser, other than a secured party, of the collateral takes free of the security interest or agricultural lien to the extent that, in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments or a security certificate, receives delivery of the collateral.</p>

                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the application of this article to a security interest in a deposit account does not affect a right of recoupment or set-off of the secured party as to a deposit account maintained with the secured party.</p>

                <p>(a) In this section, "value" has the meaning provided in section 34.1-3-303(a).</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by an assignee that takes an assignment:</p>
                <p>(i) For value;</p>
                <p>(ii) In good faith;</p>
                <p>(iii) Without notice of a claim of a property or possessory right to the property assigned; and</p>

                <p>(a) Subject to subsections (b) through (j), an account debtor on an account, chattel paper or a payment intangible may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor until, but not after, the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated by the assignor or the assignee, that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee. After receipt of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not discharge the obligation by paying the assignor.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to subsection (h), notification is ineffective under subsection (a):</p>
                <p>(i) If it does not reasonably identify the rights assigned;</p>
                <p>(ii) To the extent that an agreement between an account debtor and a seller of a payment intangible limits the account debtor's duty to pay a person other than the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this article; or</p>
                <p>(iii) At the option of an account debtor, if the notification notifies the account debtor to make less than the full amount of any installment or other periodic payment to the assignee, even if:</p>

                <p>(B) A portion has been assigned to another assignee; or</p>
                <p>(C) The account debtor knows that the assignment to that assignee is limited.</p>
                <p>(c) Subject to subsection (h), if requested by the account debtor, an assignee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made. Unless the assignee complies, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor, even if the account debtor has received a notification under subsection (a).</p>
                <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) and sections 34.1-2A-303 and 34.1-9-407, and subject to subsection (h), a term in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a promissory note is ineffective to the extent that it:</p>
                <p>(i) Prohibits, restricts or requires the consent of the account debtor or person obligated on the promissory note to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in, the account, chattel paper, payment intangible or promissory note; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination right of termination, or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible or promissory note.</p>
                <p>(e) Subsection (d) does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under W.S. 34.1-9-610 or an acceptance of collateral under W.S. 34.1-9-620.</p>
                <p>(f) Except as otherwise provided in sections 34.1-2A-303 and 34.1-9-407 and subject to subsections (h) and (j), a rule of law, statute or regulation that prohibits, restricts or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, an account or chattel paper is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute or regulation:</p>
                <p>(i) Prohibits, restricts or requires the consent of the government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the account or chattel paper; or</p>

                <p>(g) Subject to subsection (h), an account debtor may not waive or vary its option under paragraph (b)(iii).</p>
                <p>(h) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family or household purposes.</p>
                <p>(j) This section prevails over any inconsistent provision of an existing or future statute, rule or regulation of this state unless the provision is contained in a statute of this state, refers expressly to this section and states that the provision prevails over this section. Subsection (f) of this section does not apply to an assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in, a right the transfer of which is prohibited or restricted by any of the following statutes to the extent that the statute is inconsistent with subsection (f) of this section: W.S. 1-40-113, 26-15-132 and 27-14-702.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a lease agreement is ineffective to the extent that it:</p>
                <p>(i) Prohibits, restricts or requires the consent of a party to the lease to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in, an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods; or</p>

                <p>(i) A transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the term; or</p>
                <p>(ii) A delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term.</p>
                <p>(c) The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor's interest under the lease contract or the lessor's residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee's prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of section 34.1-2A-303(d) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor.</p>

                <p>(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (iii) of this subsection, if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend or restate the registered organization's name;</p>

                <p>(B) In a separate part of the financing statement:</p>

                <p>(B) If the debtor does not have a name, only if the financing statement provides the names of the partners, members, associates or other persons comprising the debtor in a manner that each name provided would be sufficient if the person named were the debtor.</p>
                <p>(b) A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (a) is not rendered ineffective by the absence of:</p>
                <p>(i) A trade name or other name of the debtor; or</p>

                <p>(c) A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.</p>
                <p>(d) Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.</p>
                <p>(e) A financing statement may provide the name of more than one (1) debtor and the name of more than one (1) secured party.</p>

                <p>(a) A consignor, lessor or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in section 34.1-9-311(a), using the terms "consignor", "consignee", "lessor", "lessee", "bailor", "bailee", "licensor", "licensee", "owner", "registered owner", "buyer", "seller" or words of similar import, instead of the terms "secured party" and "debtor".</p>
                <p>(b) This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under section 34.1-9-311(b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.</p>

                <p>(a) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 34.1-9-503(a) is seriously misleading.</p>
                <p>(c) If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 34.1-9-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.</p>
                <p>(d) For purposes of section 34.1-9-508(b), the "debtor's correct name" in subsection (c) means the correct name of the new debtor.</p>

                <p>(a) A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition.</p>
                <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and section 34.1-9-508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under section 34.1-9-506.</p>
                <p>(c) If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under W.S. 34.1-9-503(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under section 34.1-9-506:</p>
                <p>(i) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four (4) months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and</p>

                <p>(b) If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed financing statement that is effective under subsection (a) to be seriously misleading under section 34.1-9-506:</p>
                <p>(i) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four (4) months after, the new debtor becomes bound under section 34.1-9-203(d); and</p>

                <p>(c) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise.

Upon the expiration of the specified period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d).

                <p>(f) If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed.</p>
                <p>(g) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under section 34.1-9-502(c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.</p>

                <p>(II) Identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under section 34.1-9-515.</p>
                <p>(C) In the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does not identify the debtor's surname; or</p>
                <p>(D) In the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in section 34.1-9-501(a)(i), the record does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which it relates.</p>

                <p>(v) In the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the record does not:</p>

                <p>(B) Indicate whether the name provided as the name of the debtor is the name of an individual or an organization;</p>
                <p>(C) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 8, ยง 3.</p>
                <p>(vi) In the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under section 34.1-9-514(a) or an amendment filed under section 34.1-9-514(b), the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee; or</p>
                <p>(vii) In the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six (6) month period prescribed by section 34.1-9-515(d).</p>
                <p>(c) For purposes of subsection (b):</p>
                <p>(i) A record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information; and</p>
                <p>(ii) A record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by section 34.1-9-512, 34.1-9-514 or 34.1-9-518, is an initial financing statement.</p>
                <p>(d) A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), fees for services rendered by the filing office under this part must be set by rule adopted by the secretary of state. The rule must set the fees for filing and indexing a record under this article on the following basis:</p>
                <p>(i) If a record presented for filing is communicated to the filing office in writing and consists of more than two (2) pages, the fee for filing and indexing the record must be at least twice the amount of the fee for a record communicated in writing that consists of one (1) or two (2) pages; and</p>
                <p>(ii) If the record is communicated by another medium authorized by filing-office rule, the fee for filing and indexing the record must be no more than half the amount of the fee for a record communicated in writing that consists of one (1) or two (2) pages.</p>

                <p>(c) The number of names required to be indexed does not affect the amount of the fees in subsections (a) and (b).</p>
                <p>(d) The rule adopted pursuant to subsection (a) must set the fee for responding to a request for information from the filing office, including for communicating whether there is on file any financing statement naming a particular debtor. A fee for responding to a request communicated in writing must be not less than twice the amount of the fee for responding to a request communicated by another medium authorized by filing-office rule. This subsection does not require that a fee be charged for remote access searching of the filing office data base. The rule adopted pursuant to subsection (a) need not specify a fee for remote access searching of the filing office data base.</p>
                <p>(e) This section does not require a fee with respect to a record of mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut under section 34.1-9-502(c). However, the recording and satisfaction fees that otherwise would be applicable to the record of mortgage apply.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-9-619. Transfer of record or legal title.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) In this section, "transfer statement" means a record authenticated by a secured party stating:</p>
                <p>(i) That the debtor has defaulted in connection with an obligation secured by specified collateral;</p>
                <p>(ii) That the secured party has exercised its post-default remedies with respect to the collateral;</p>
                <p>(iii) That, by reason of the exercise, a transferee has acquired the rights of the debtor in the collateral; and</p>
                <p>(iv) The name and mailing address of the secured party, debtor and transferee.</p>
                <p>(b) A transfer statement entitles the transferee to the transfer of record of all rights of the debtor in the collateral specified in the statement in any official filing, recording, registration or certificate-of-title system covering the collateral. If a transfer statement is presented with the applicable fee and request form to the official or office responsible for maintaining the system, the official or office shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Accept the transfer statement;</p>
                <p>(ii) Promptly amend its records to reflect the transfer; and</p>
                <p>(iii) If applicable, issue a new appropriate certificate of title in the name of the transferee.</p>
                <p>(c) A transfer of the record or legal title to collateral to a secured party under subsection (b) or otherwise is not of itself a disposition of collateral under this article and does not of itself relieve the secured party of its duties under this article.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-9-620. Acceptance of collateral in full or partial satisfaction of obligation; compulsory disposition of collateral.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a secured party may accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if:</p>
                <p>(i) The debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c);</p>
                <p>(ii) The secured party does not receive, within the time set forth in subsection (d), a notification of objection to the proposal authenticated by:</p>

                <p>(iii) If the collateral is consumer goods, the collateral is not in the possession of the debtor when the debtor consents to the acceptance; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Subsection (e) does not require the secured party to dispose of the collateral or the debtor waives the requirement pursuant to section 34.1-9-624.</p>

                <p>(i) The secured party consents to the acceptance in an authenticated record or sends a proposal to the debtor; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The conditions of subsection (a) are met.</p>

                <p>(ii) A debtor consents to an acceptance of collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if the debtor agrees to the terms of the acceptance in a record authenticated after default or the secured party:</p>
                <p>(A) Sends to the debtor after default a proposal that is unconditional or subject only to a condition that collateral not in the possession of the secured party be preserved or maintained;</p>
                <p>(B) In the proposal, proposes to accept collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures; and</p>
                <p>(C) Does not receive a notification of objection authenticated by the debtor within twenty (20) days after the proposal is sent.</p>
                <p>(d) To be effective under paragraph (a)(ii), a notification of objection must be received by the secured party:</p>
                <p>(i) In the case of a person to which the proposal was sent pursuant to section 34.1-9-621, within twenty (20) days after notification was sent to that person; and</p>
                <p>(ii) In other cases:</p>
                <p>(A) Within twenty (20) days after the last notification was sent pursuant to section 34.1-9-621; or</p>
                <p>(B) If a notification was not sent, before the debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c).</p>
                <p>(e) A secured party that has taken possession of collateral shall dispose of the collateral pursuant to section 34.1-9-610 within the time specified in subsection (f) if:</p>
                <p>(i) Sixty percent (60%) of the cash price has been paid in the case of a purchase-money security interest in consumer goods; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Sixty percent (60%) of the principal amount of the obligation secured has been paid in the case of a nonpurchase-money security interest in consumer goods.</p>
                <p>(f) To comply with subsection (e), the secured party shall dispose of the collateral:</p>
                <p>(i) Within ninety (90) days after taking possession;</p>
                <p>or</p>
                <p>(ii) Within any longer period to which the debtor and all secondary obligors have agreed in an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default.</p>
                <p>(g) In a consumer transaction, a secured party may not accept collateral in partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34.1-9-625. Remedies for secured party's failure to comply with article.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this article, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions.</p>
                <p>(b) Subject to subsections (c), (d) and (f), a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this article. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in section 34.1-9-628:</p>
                <p>(i) A person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) for its loss; and</p>
                <p>(ii) If the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus ten percent (10%) of the principal amount of the obligation or the time-price differential plus ten percent (10%) of the cash price.</p>
                <p>(d) A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under section 34.1-9-626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus. However, a debtor or secondary obligor whose deficiency is eliminated or reduced under section 34.1-9-626 may not otherwise recover under subsection (b) for noncompliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance.</p>
                <p>(e) In addition to any damages recoverable under subsection (b), the debtor, consumer obligor or person named as a debtor in a filed record, as applicable, may recover five hundred dollars ($500.00) in each case from a person that:</p>
                <p>(i) Fails to comply with section 34.1-9-208;</p>
                <p>(ii) Fails to comply with section 34.1-9-209;</p>
                <p>(iii) Files a record that the person is not entitled to file under section 34.1-9-509(a);</p>
                <p>(iv) Fails to cause the secured party of record to file or send a termination statement as required by section 34.1-9-513(a) or (c);</p>
                <p>(v) Fails to comply with section 34.1-9-616(b)(i) and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance; or</p>
                <p>(vi) Fails to comply with section 34.1-9-616(b)(ii).</p>
                <p>(f) A debtor or consumer obligor may recover damages under subsection (b) and, in addition, five hundred dollars ($500.00) in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with a request under section 34.1-9-210. A recipient of a request under section 34.1-9-210 which never claimed an interest in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under that section has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within the meaning of this subsection.</p>
                <p>(g) If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under section 34.1-9-210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure.</p>

                <p>(a) In an action arising from a transaction, other than a consumer transaction, in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p>(i) A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue;</p>
                <p>(ii) If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this part;</p>
                <p>(iii) Except as otherwise provided in section 34.1-9-628, if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney's fees exceeds the greater of:</p>
                <p>(A) The proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance; or</p>
                <p>(B) The amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance.</p>
                <p>(iv) For purposes of subparagraph (a)(iii)(B), the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney's fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum;</p>
                <p>(v) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under section 34.1-9-615(f), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party or a secondary obligor would have brought.</p>
                <p>(b) The limitation of the rules in subsection (a) to transactions other than consumer transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.</p>

                <p>(a) The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.</p>
                <p>(b) A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made:</p>
                <p>(i) In the usual manner on any recognized market;</p>
                <p>(ii) At the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition; or</p>
                <p>(iii) Otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.</p>
                <p>(c) A collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved:</p>
                <p>(i) In a judicial proceeding;</p>
                <p>(ii) By a bona fide creditors' committee;</p>

                <p>(iv) By an assignee for the benefit of creditors.</p>
                <p>(d) Approval under subsection (c) need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is not commercially reasonable.</p>

                <p>(a) If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before this act takes effect and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before this act takes effect, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this act within one (1) year after this act takes effect. An attached security interest becomes unperfected one (1) year after this act takes effect unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this act before the expiration of that period.</p>
                <p>(b) The filing of a financing statement before this act takes effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this act.</p>
                <p>(c) This act does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before this act takes effect, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former section 34.1-9-103. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) and section 34.1-9-706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of:</p>
                <p>(i) The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or</p>
                <p>(ii) June 30, 2006.</p>
                <p>(d) The filing of a continuation statement after this act takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before this act takes effect. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after this act takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before this act takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(e) Paragraph (c)(ii) applies to a financing statement that, before this act takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former section 34.1-9-103 only to the extent that Part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.</p>
                <p>(f) A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before this act takes effect and a continuation statement filed after this act takes effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement.</p>

                <p>(a) The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in section 34.1-9-501 continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this act takes effect if:</p>
                <p>(i) The filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under this act;</p>
                <p>(ii) The preeffective date financing statement was filed in an office in another state or another office in this state; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The initial financing statement satisfies subsection (c).</p>
                <p>(b) The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection (a) continues the effectiveness of the prefecture date financing statement:</p>
                <p>(i) If the initial financing statement is filed before this act takes effect, for the period provided in former section 34.1-9-403 with respect to a financing statement; and</p>

                <p>(ii) Identify the preeffective date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement; and</p>

                <p>(a) In this section, "pre-effective-date financing statement" means a financing statement filed before this act takes effect.</p>
                <p>(b) After this act takes effect, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in, a preeffective date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in part 3. However, the effectiveness of a preeffective date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, if the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a preeffective date financing statement may be amended after this act takes effect only if:</p>
                <p>(i) The preeffective date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in section 34.1-9-501;</p>
                <p>(ii) An amendment is filed in the office specified in section 34.1-9-501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies section 34.1-9-706(c); or</p>
                <p>(iii) An initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies section 34.1-9-706(c) is filed in the office specified in section 23.1-9-501.</p>
                <p>(d) If the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a preeffective date financing statement may be continued only under section 34.1-9-705(d) and (f) or 34.1-9-706.</p>
                <p>(e) Whether or not the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a preeffective date financing statement filed in this state may be terminated after this act takes effect by filing a termination statement in the office in which the preeffective date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies section 34.1-9-706(c) has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in part 3 as the office in which to file a financing statement.</p>

                <p>(a) This act determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral. However, if the relative priorities of the claims were established before this act takes effect, former article 9 determines priority.</p>
                <p>(b) For purposes of section 34.1-9-322(a), the priority of a security interest that becomes enforceable under section 34.1-9-203 of this act dates from the time this act takes effect if the security interest is perfected under this act by the filing of a financing statement before this act takes effect which would not have been effective to perfect the security interest under former article 9. This subsection does not apply to conflicting security interests each of which is perfected by the filing of such a financing statement.</p>

                <p>(a) The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2013, is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this title, as amended by the 2013 amendments.</p>
                <p>(b) The 2013 amendments do not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before July 1, 2013, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this title, as it existed before the 2013 amendments. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section and W.S. 34.1-9-806, the financing statement ceases to be effective:</p>
                <p>(i) If the financing statement is filed in this state, at the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective had the 2013 amendments not taken effect; or</p>
                <p>(ii) If the financing statement is filed in another jurisdiction, at the earlier of:</p>
                <p>(A) The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of that jurisdiction; or</p>
                <p>(B) June 30, 2018.</p>
                <p>(c) The filing of a continuation statement on or after July 1, 2013, does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before July 1, 2013. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement on or after July 1, 2013, and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this title, as amended by the 2013 amendments, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before July 1, 2013, continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(d) Subparagraph (b)(ii)(B) of this section applies to a financing statement that, before July 1, 2013, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this title, as it existed before the 2013 amendments, only to the extent that this title, as amended by the 2013 amendments, provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.</p>
                <p>(e) A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before July 1, 2013, and a continuation statement filed on or after July 1, 2013, is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of W.S. 34.1-9-501 through 34.1-9-526, as amended by the 2013 amendments, for an initial financing statement. A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a decedent's estate indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative within the meaning of W.S. 34.1-9-503(a)(ii), as amended by the 2013 amendments. A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee acting with respect to a property held in trust indicates that the collateral is held in a trust within the meaning of W.S. 34.1-9-503(a)(iii), as amended by the 2013 amendments.</p>

                <p>(b) The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection (a) of this section continues the effectiveness of the pre-effective-date financing statement:</p>
                <p>(i) If the initial financing statement is filed before July 1, 2013, for the period provided in W.S. 34.1-9-515 as that section was in effect on June 30, 2013, with respect to an initial financing statement; and</p>

                <p>(a) In this section, "pre-effective-date financing statement" means a financing statement filed before July 1, 2013.</p>
                <p>(b) On and after July 1, 2013, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in a pre- effective-date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this title, as amended by the 2013 amendments. However, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed.</p>
                <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, if the law of the state governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a pre-effective-date financing statement may be amended on and after July 1, 2013, only if:</p>
                <p>(i) The pre-effective-date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in W.S. 34.1-9-501;</p>
                <p>(ii) An amendment is filed in the office specified in W.S. 34.1-9-501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies W.S. 34.1-9-806(c); or</p>
                <p>(iii) An initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies W.S. 34.1-9-806(c) is filed in the office specified in W.S. 34.1-9-501.</p>
                <p>(d) If the law of the state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2013, may be continued only under W.S. 34.1-9-805(c) or (e) and 34.1-9-806.</p>
                <p>(e) Whether or not the law of the state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2013, in the state may be terminated on or after July 1, 2013, by filing a termination statement in the office in which the pre-effective-date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies W.S. 34.1-9-806(c) has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this title, as amended by the 2013 amendments, as the office in which to file a financing statement.</p>
