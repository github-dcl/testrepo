                  <p>(a) On or before the first day of July of each year the director of revenue shall, by requiring special reports or otherwise, determine the total aggregate amount of the gross Wyoming intrastate retail revenues of all public utilities, entities utilizing public utility facilities in the state to furnish retail utility commodities or services to the public, and providers of telecommunication services, except motor carriers, and those utilities exempted under W.S. 37-2-108, for the preceding calendar year. He shall then determine the ratio that one-half (1/2) of the total authorized budgeted amount for the biennium is to the total aggregate gross retail Wyoming intrastate operating revenues. The resulting percentage factor shall then be applied to the annual intrastate gross retail operating revenues of each of such persons for the preceding calendar year and the result shall be the assessment of each such person for the ensuing budget fiscal year. However, the assessment rate against the persons for any one (1) year shall not exceed .0030 of the gross Wyoming intrastate retail revenues of the persons. By the first day of August the director of the revenue department shall assess the persons, and one-half (1/2) the assessed fees shall be paid to him by the persons on or before the first day of October and one-half (1/2) of the fees shall be paid to him by the persons on or before the first day of April in the ensuing year. The director of the revenue department, in computing the percentage upon which fees for the first fiscal year of the ensuing biennium shall be based, shall deduct any unexpended balance in the commission's account, less an amount equal to the total of all properly authorized outstanding accounts payable, from one-half (1/2) the total authorized budgeted amount for the biennium, and the resultant figure shall be used instead of the one-half (1/2) of the total authorized budgeted amount for the biennium, as above provided. Any unexpended balance in the commission's account shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal period. "Intrastate gross retail operating revenues" as used in this section shall mean intrastate gross revenues derived from the provision of telecommunications, gas, electric, water and pipeline service offered for final consumption and not for resale.</p>

                  <p>(b) If, upon hearing and investigation, any service or service regulation of any public utility shall be found by the commission to be unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential, or any service or facility shall be found to be inadequate or unsafe, or any service regulation shall be found to be unjust or unreasonable, or any service, facility or service regulation shall be found otherwise in any respect to be in violation of any provisions of this act, the commission may prescribe and order substituted therefor such service, facility or service regulation, as it shall determine to be adequate and safe, or just and reasonable, as the case may be and otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this act, including any provisions concerning the availability or reliability of service. It shall be the duty of the public utility to comply with and conform to such determination and order of the commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) In setting rates, the commission shall allow the inclusion of purchase power cost from a qualifying facility only to the extent that the cost of energy, capacity or both in the transaction are determined by the commission to be less than or equal to the utility's avoided cost, considering the cost of energy or capacity from all other available generation sources and the incremental cost of transporting the energy from a qualifying facility to customer load. This subsection shall not be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of applicable federal statutes and regulations.</p>
                  <p>(d) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Qualifying facility" means a facility that meets the qualification standards used in federal regulations promulgated under the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act.</p>
                  <p>(i) "Avoided cost" means to the extent that a distribution cooperative is an all-requirements power supply customer of a generation and transmission cooperative or other wholesale power supplier, the distribution cooperative's avoided costs are the generation and transmission cooperative's or wholesale power supplier's avoided cost;</p>

                  <p>(a) The commission shall have regulatory safety jurisdiction over any "intrastate gas pipeline facility" as defined under the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006, 49 U.S.C. ยง 60101, et seq., as amended, for the sole purpose of implementing the safety standards and practices of the federal act to such intrastate gas pipeline facility. This jurisdiction shall not apply to an "intrastate gas pipeline facility" which is otherwise subject to federal regulatory jurisdiction for safety purposes. The commission is authorized under this section to implement such safety standards and practices only to the extent the secretary of transportation is so authorized under the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006.

                  <p>(a) The provisions of this chapter and chapters 1 and 3 of this title shall not apply to a person who operates a coal fired electric generation facility purchased under an agreement approved by the commission under W.S. 37-3-117.</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 7/1/2021 this section will read as:</p>
                  <p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of this chapter and chapters 1 and 3 of this title shall not apply to a person who operates a coal fired electric generation facility purchased under an agreement approved by the commission under W.S. 37-3-117.</p>
                  <p>(b) Electric public utilities, other than cooperative electric utilities, shall be obligated to purchase electricity generated from a coal fired electric generation facility purchased under agreement approved by the commission under W.S. 37-3-117 provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person purchasing the otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility offers to sell some or all of the electricity from the facility to an electric public utility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The electricity is sold at a price that is no greater than the purchasing electric utility's avoided cost as may be determined by the commission;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The electricity is sold under a power purchase agreement with a specified term length and such other terms and conditions as may be approved by the commission; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The commission approves a one hundred percent (100%) cost recovery in rates for the cost of the power purchase agreement and the agreement is one hundred percent (100%) allocated to the public utility's Wyoming customers unless otherwise agreed to by the public utility.</p>
                  <p>(c) In determining an electric public utility's avoided costs under this section, the commission may consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) The value of the electric energy and capacity generated from the facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The value of any reliability benefits associated with the operation of the facility; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any other factor deemed appropriate by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(d) The commission may elect to set the avoided cost price and other terms and conditions for the purchase of electricity from an otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility in advance of the facility's proposed retirement date to permit potential purchasers to know the avoided cost price and other terms and conditions for sales from that facility prior to entering into an agreement to purchase the facility.</p>
                  <p>(e) As used in this section, "avoided cost" means the incremental costs to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity or both which, but for the purchase from the otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility, the utility would generate itself or incur in a purchase from another source. As may be determined by the commission, avoided costs may change over the course of an approved power purchase agreement at specified intervals set forth in the power purchase agreement.</p>
                  <p>(f) A person purchasing an otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility may sell electricity generated by the facility to the electric public utility selling the otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility, except for a cooperative or municipal public utility, for the benefit of a retail customer located in the existing service territory of that electric public utility provided that the customer has more than one (1) megawatt average demand and takes service at a primary or transmission voltage level. [NOTE: This section will be effective 7/1/2021.]</p>
                  <p>(g) If an electric utility purchases electricity from the owner of an otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility for the benefit of an eligible retail customer, the utility serving that eligible retail customer shall purchase the electricity at a cost and under terms and conditions that are acceptable to and negotiated between the customer and the owner of the otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility. The electric public utility shall pass that cost through to the customer without markup or modification except: [NOTE: This section will be effective 7/1/2021.]</p>
                  <p>(i) For the collection of applicable taxes and the appropriate uniform assessment, which shall be collected pursuant to W.S. 37-2-106 through 37-2-109; [NOTE: This paragraph will be effective 7/1/2021.]</p>
                  <p>(ii) To ensure other Wyoming customers are not negatively impacted by the arrangement provided for in this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, the commission shall also authorize the utility to impose additional charges on participating retail customers to the extent the commission determines that a sale of electricity under this subsection and subsection (f) of this section will result in the utility experiencing incremental stranded generation capacity costs or other incremental costs except for the cost of any undepreciated investments associated with the otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility. [NOTE: This paragraph will be effective 7/1/2021.]</p>
                  <p>(h) An eligible retail customer under subsection (g) of this section shall only receive electricity as provided in subsection (g) of this section from the owner of an otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility if the customer also purchases partial requirements or equivalent service from the electric public utility under rates, terms and conditions set by the commission to compensate the public utility for its costs. [NOTE: This section will be effective 7/1/2021.]</p>

The verification shall be made by said official holding office, at the time of the filing of said report, and, if not made upon the knowledge of the person verifying the same, shall set forth the source of his information and the grounds of his beliefs as to any matters not stated to be verified upon his knowledge. The commission shall prescribe the form of such reports and the character of the information to be contained therein, and may from time to time make such changes and such additions in regard to form and contents thereof as it may deem proper and each year shall furnish a blank form for such annual reports to every such public utility. Such report shall also cover the period, and be filed at the time prescribed by the commission. The contents of such report and the form thereof shall conform in the case of interstate public utilities as nearly as may be to that required of interstate public utilities under the act of congress entitled "An act to regulate commerce", approved February fourth, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven [1887], and the acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto. The originals of said reports subscribed and sworn to as prescribed by law, shall be filed in the office of the commission. The commission may require, by order of any public utility or person, specific answers to questions upon which the commission may need information. If any public utility shall fail to make and file its annual report within the time ordered, or the time extended by the commission, it shall be subject to the penalty as provided for under W.S. 37-12-204.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall, within its jurisdiction, have power, in its discretion, to prescribe uniform methods of keeping accounts, records and books, to be observed by all public utilities operating within the state. It may also in its discretion prescribe by order, forms of accounts, records and memoranda to be kept by such public utilities. Notice of alterations by the commission in the required method or form of keeping a system of accounts shall be given to such public utility by the commission at least six (6) months before the same shall take effect. Any other and additional forms of accounts, records and memoranda kept by such public utility shall be subject to examination by the commission. The system of accounts, established by the commission and the forms of accounts, records and memoranda prescribed by it shall in the case of interstate public utilities conform as nearly as may be to those prescribed by the surface transportation board under the act of congress, entitled "An act to regulate commerce", and the acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto.</p>
                  <p>(d) Every public utility shall report to the commission, under rules and regulations prescribed by the commission and harmonizing insofar as practicable with those of the surface transportation board, and of any other department of this state, every accident occurring upon the property of any public utility or directly or indirectly arising from or connected with the maintenance or operation of the plant, equipment, appliances, apparatus, property or facilities of such public utility resulting in loss of life or injury to person or property; provided, that whenever any accident occasions the loss of life or limb to any person, such public utility shall straightway advise the commission of the fact by the speediest available means of communication.</p>
                  <p>(e) The commission shall investigate the cause of all such accidents resulting in loss of life or injury to persons or property, as in the judgment of the commission requires investigation by it, and the commission shall have power to make such order with respect thereto, as it may deem just and reasonable.</p>
                  <p>(f) Nothing in this act in relation to service regulation or in relation to reports or the methods of keeping accounts, records or books shall apply to any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce; provided, that, the department of transportation may, upon proper notice, require any common carrier to furnish to the department of transportation copies of any reports as it may designate which any common carrier may have filed with the surface transportation board.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>37-2-205. Certificate of convenience and necessity; hearings.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Except as provided in this subsection, no public utility shall begin construction or complete the purchase of a line or plant, or of any extension of a line or material addition to a plant, without having first obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require such construction or purchase. This act shall not be construed to require any public utility operating outside of a city or town to secure a certificate for an extension into an area within which it has lawfully commenced operation, or for an extension into territory contiguous to its line or plant for which no certificate is in force and is not served by a public utility of like character or for any extension within or to territory already served by it, necessary in the ordinary course of its business. If any public utility, in constructing or extending its line or plant interferes or is about to interfere with the operation of the line or plant of any other public utility already authorized or constructed, the commission on complaint of the public utility claiming to be injuriously affected, may after hearing make such order and prescribe the terms and conditions for the location of the lines or plants affected, as to it are just and reasonable. The power companies may, without the certificate, increase capacity of existing plants. For purposes of this subsection, "material addition" shall not include an addition to a plant that is necessary to serve load growth, provided that the capital investment in the addition shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the total capital investment in the plant on which return is earned, that is assigned or allocated to Wyoming customers, based on the public utility's most recent rate case determination.</p>
                  <p>(b) No public utility shall henceforth exercise any right or privilege or obtain a franchise or permit to exercise such right or privilege from a municipality or county, without having first obtained from the commission a certificate that public convenience and necessity require the exercise of such right and privilege; provided, that when the commission shall find, after hearing, that a public utility has heretofore begun actual construction work and is prosecuting such work in good faith, uninterruptedly and with reasonable diligence in proportion to the magnitude of the undertaking, under any franchise or permit heretofore granted but not heretofore actually exercised, such public utility may proceed to the completion of such work, and may, after such completion exercise such right or privilege; and provided, further, that this section shall not be construed to validate any right or privilege now invalid or hereafter becoming invalid under any law of this state, nor impair any vested right in any franchise or permit heretofore granted.</p>
                  <p>(c) Before any certificate may issue, under this section, a certified copy of its articles of incorporation or charter, if the applicant be a corporation, shall be filed in the office of the commission. The commission shall have power, after hearing involving the financial ability and good faith of the applicant and the necessity of additional service in the community, to issue said certificate, as prayed for, or to refuse to issue the same, or to issue to it for the construction of a portion only of the contemplated line, plant, or system, or of a portion only, of the contemplated line, plant, system or extension thereof, or for the partial exercise only of said right or privilege, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by said certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon its own motion, or on complaint of any person the commission shall have power to investigate and determine whether the competitive rates, charges and service existing between any public utilities are fair, just and reasonable, after hearing thereon to determine, fix and order such rates, charges, regulations and remedies as will establish reasonable and just rates, between said competing public utilities, and between said public utilities and their customers and patrons.</p>
                  <p>(e) Where a certificate for the construction and operation of a high voltage electric transmission line of 230 KV or greater is required, the public service commission shall publish notice of application in a newspaper of general circulation in each county where the line will be constructed. The public service commission shall give actual notice of hearing on the application by registered mail at the applicant's expense to each landowner who may be affected. The notice of hearing shall be given at least thirty (30) days before the hearing is held and shall contain a summary of the pertinent facts about the application.</p>
                  <p>(f) In the case of a certificate for the construction of a high voltage electric transmission line of 230 KV or greater, the issuance of the certificate shall be conditioned so that no construction of the line is authorized until all right-of-way for the line has been acquired.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any electric utility which provided service to any part of the annexed area prior to annexation and which does not receive a franchise from the annexing municipality to serve the annexed area shall receive just compensation from the public or private utility franchised to serve the annexed area. If the affected utilities cannot agree on just compensation within thirty (30) days after the franchise has been issued and become final after any challenge thereto, the affected utilities shall submit the matter to arbitration before the public service commission pursuant to W.S. 37-2-113. Upon conclusion of the arbitration proceedings and payment of the compensation determined to be just, ownership of the facilities shall be transferred to the acquiring utility.</p>
                  <p>(h) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, the commission may authorize the construction of segments of a transmission line before right-of-way is acquired for an entire transmission line provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The public utility has satisfied all requirements for the issuance of a certificate except subsection (f) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The public utility has obtained all required right-of-way within the authorized segment;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Authorization to construct the transmission line within the authorized segment shall not exceed ten (10) miles from the advancing end of an authorized segment, provided that the commission may waive the ten (10) mile limitation if the transmission line segment is:</p>
                  <p>(A) Located entirely between substations or switching stations;</p>
                  <p>(B) Located between a substation or switching station and the state line; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Located entirely within state or federal land.</p>
                  <p>(iv) Notice has been provided to all private property owners along the entire length of the proposed transmission line;</p>
                  <p>(v) The commission provides an opportunity for private property owners who are adversely affected by the location of the segment an opportunity to be heard before the authorization of a segment concerning the location of the segment or the impact of any future extension of the transmission line.</p>
                  <p>(j) Unless otherwise determined by the commission, issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity shall not confer the right to recover a specific amount of the costs of the construction or purchase in rates charged to Wyoming customers. Actual costs of the construction or purchase may be considered by the commission in a separate rate case determination.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section and unless otherwise waived by the commission, no public utility shall begin construction or complete the purchase of a line or plant, or of any extension of a line or material addition to a plant, outside the state of Wyoming without having first obtained from the commission a nonsitus certificate of public convenience and necessity determining that the present or future need for the nonsitus resource is prudent and in the public interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) A certificate shall only be required under this section if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The nonsitus resource is intended by the public utility to be a capital investment in a plant on which return is earned in Wyoming; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The capital investment in the nonsitus resource exceeds one percent (1%) of the total capital investment in the plant on which return is earned, that is assigned or allocated to Wyoming customers, based on the public utility's most recent general rate case determination.</p>
                  <p>(c) No public utility shall include a capital investment in a nonsitus resource in rates charged to Wyoming customers without having first obtained from the commission a nonsitus certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Unless otherwise determined by the commission, issuance of a nonsitus certificate of public convenience and necessity shall not confer the right to recover a specific amount of the costs of the nonsitus resource in rates charged to Wyoming customers. Actual costs of the capital investment may be considered by the commission in a separate rate case determination.</p>
                  <p>(e) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Nonsitus resource" means construction or complete the purchase of a line or plant, or of any extension of a line or material addition to a plant, outside the state of Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Public utility" shall not include any cooperative electric utility as defined in W.S. 37-17-101(a)(i) that is exempt from public service commission retail rate regulation.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever a public utility supplying gas, natural gas or electricity has undercharged any customer as the result of a meter or metering inaccuracy or other continuing problem under its control, the utility may only bill the customer for the amount of the unmetered gas or electricity rendered in the one hundred eighty-three (183) days immediately prior to the date the utility remedies the meter inaccuracy. The maximum portion of the undercharge for unmetered gas or electricity rendered that may be recovered from the customer in any billing month shall be determined by dividing the amount of the undercharge by twelve (12) and the quotient is the maximum portion of the undercharge that the utility may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, recover from the customer in any billing month, in addition to either regular monthly charges of any type or regular level payment amounts billed in accordance with an agreement between the customer and the utility. Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the time period over which the undercharge may be collected shall be twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
                  <p>(b) No utility shall recover any interest charge, service charge or fee, whether or not a percentage is utilized for its computation, for billings made pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the customer from paying an undercharge or any portion thereof in a time shorter than that stated in this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a gas, natural gas or electric utility from collecting an undercharge or any portion thereof in a time longer than that stated in this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) A gas, natural gas or electric utility may not collect any amount otherwise permitted to be collected under this section unless the utility, in the first bill the purpose of which is to collect the amount for unmetered gas or electric service, states the entire amount that it seeks to collect.</p>
                  <p>(e) No gas, natural gas or electric utility required to follow this section in order to collect an undercharge from a customer may shut off the service of the customer except for safety reasons, except in the event of a request by the customer and except to enforce a shut-off provision in its filed tariffs with the commission that is triggered by nonpayment by a customer of a lawfully owing past due amount.</p>
                  <p>(f) This section does not apply to any act that is an offense under W.S. 37-12-111 through 37-12-118, or where a physical act of a customer or its agent causes inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading or inaccurate or no measurement of the gas or electricity rendered.</p>

A rate shall not be considered unjust or unreasonable on the basis that it is innovative in form or in substance, that it takes into consideration competitive marketplace elements or that it provides for incentives to a public utility. Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 15-7-407, no public utility shall in any manner charge, demand, collect or receive from any person greater or less or different compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by the public utility than is charged, demanded, collected or received by the public utility from any other person for a like and contemporaneous service under similar circumstances and conditions. The commission may determine that rates for the same service may vary depending on cost, the competitive marketplace, the need for universally available and affordable service, the need for contribution to the joint and common costs of the public utility, volume and other discounts, and other reasonable business practices. Nothing in this title shall prohibit any public utility from furnishing free or reduced rate service to its current or pensioned employees and dependent family members under rates approved by the commission.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>37-3-106. Temporary suspension of rates; burden of proof; notice of rate changes; bonding; refunding of amounts collected in excess of final rates.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) At any hearing as provided in this act involving an increase in rates or charges sought by a public utility, the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just and reasonable shall be upon the utility.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless the commission otherwise orders, no public utility shall make any change in any rate which has been duly established except after thirty (30) days notice to the commission, which notice shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made in the rates then in force, and the time when the changed rates will go into effect. The utility shall also give such notice of the proposed changes to other interested persons as the commission in its discretion may direct. All proposed changes shall be shown by filing new tariffs which shall be kept open to public inspection. When the commission establishes any rate which is innovative in form or substance, takes into consideration competitive marketplace elements or provides for incentives to a public utility, the rate may contain any provision for subsequent notice or the absence thereof which is supported by the public interest.</p>
                  <p>(c) Whenever there is filed with the commission by any public utility any application or tariff proposing a new rate or rates, the commission may, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative, initiate an investigation, hearing, or both, concerning the lawfulness of such rate or rates. Pending its decision thereon, the commission may suspend such rate or rates, before they become effective but not for a longer initial period than six (6) months beyond the time when such rate or rates would otherwise go into effect. If the commission shall thereafter find that a longer time will be required, the commission may extend the period of suspension for an additional period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate, three (3) months.</p>
                  <p>(d) The public utility may file an application requesting, and the commission may order such suspended rate or rates or any portion thereof to be put into effect at any time, in which event the commission may require a bond which shall secure a refund to persons entitled thereto of the amount, if any, finally determined to be excessive. The application and the bond in terms, amount and sureties shall be subject to the commission's approval.</p>
                  <p>(e) As ordered by the commission, the utility shall promptly refund to persons entitled thereto all amounts collected by it in excess of the final rates approved by the commission plus reasonable interest at a rate to be determined by the commission, and as ordered by the commission and upon such time and conditions as the commission shall specify, shall promptly pay all amounts not so refunded to the general fund of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(f) In any case involving a proposed change in rates, the commission may permit the utility to make effective without suspension only that portion of the change which the commission may determine to be proper under the circumstances.</p>

Every public utility operating within the state shall receive and transmit without delay or discrimination, any message, service, passenger or property or facility of or from every other similar public utility with whose line or plant or system a physical connection may have been made.

Said commission shall also have the power to direct the manner by which all utilities shall cross public highways and other utilities and by which public highways shall cross the utilities and to prescribe methods of approach and crossing that shall secure safety to the public; provided, however, that with respect to approaches and crossings of overhead lines, the provisions of the current edition of the National Electrical Safety Code above prescribed shall apply, except as provided herein with respect to Y-connected circuits with neutral conductors effectively grounded throughout their length where the voltage does not exceed fifteen thousand (15,000) volts. At every such crossing, in case the persons interested do not themselves agree, it shall be the duty of the commission to apportion between the parties, in accordance with justice, the costs and expenses of installing and maintaining such crossings. In case expense is apportioned to be paid by a public highway the portion so to be paid by such highway shall be paid by the city or town in case the crossing line is within the boundaries of a city or town, and by the county in which the crossing is situated in case the same is not within any city or town.</p>
                  <p>Provided that all such equipment, plant, and facilities shall be maintained in such working condition that will provide a minimum of interference with radio and television reception to residents and highway users in the immediate area of such equipment, plant, and facilities.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the rates charged by an electric public utility, other than a cooperative electric utility, shall not include any recovery of or earnings on the capital costs associated with new electric generation facilities built, in whole or in part, to replace the electricity generated from one (1) or more coal fired electric generating facilities located in Wyoming and retired on or after January 1, 2022, unless the commission has determined that the public utility that owned the retired coal fired electric generation facility made a good faith effort to sell the facility to another person prior to its retirement and that the public utility did not refuse a reasonable offer to purchase the facility or the commission determines that, if a reasonable offer was received, the sale was not completed for a reason beyond the reasonable control of the public utility.</p>
                  <p>Note: Effective 7/1/2021 this section will read as: Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any electric public utility seeking to retire a coal fired electric generation facility shall first make a good faith effort to sell the facility for continued use as a coal fired electric generation facility; [Note: Effective 7/1/2021 this paragraph will read as:]</p>
                  <p>(ii) The rates charged by an electric public utility, other than a cooperative electric utility, shall not include any recovery of or earnings on the capital costs associated with new electric generation facilities built, in whole or in part, to replace the electricity generated from one (1) or more coal fired electric generating facilities located in Wyoming and retired on or after January 1, 2022, unless the commission has determined that the public utility that owned the retired coal fired electric generation facility made a good faith effort to sell the facility to another person prior to its retirement and that the public utility did not refuse a reasonable offer to purchase the facility or the commission determines that, if a reasonable offer was received, the sale was not completed for a reason beyond the reasonable control of the public utility. [Note: Effective 7/1/2021 this paragraph will read as:]</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining whether the public utility made a good faith effort to sell the retired coal fired electric generation facility under this section the commission shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether the public utility provided sufficient time prior to the facility's retirement for potential purchasers to evaluate purchasing the facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether the public utility used reasonable efforts to make potential purchasers aware of the opportunity to purchase the facility;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether the public utility reasonably evaluated any offers received by the public utility for the purchase of the facility; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any other factor deemed appropriate by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) In determining whether an offer to purchase a coal fired electric generation facility under this section was reasonable the commission shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether accepting the offer to purchase the retired facility would have reduced costs to the public utility's customers as compared to retiring the facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether accepting the offer to purchase the retired facility would have reduced risks to the public utility's customers as compared to retiring the facility including any diminished environmental remediation risks; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether accepting the offer to purchase the retired facility would have been in the public interest.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon application by a public utility, the commission may approve procedures for the solicitation and review of offers to purchase an otherwise retiring electric generation facility in advance of a proposed retirement. If the public utility follows the procedures approved by the commission to solicit and review offers to purchase an otherwise retiring electric generation facility under this subsection, there shall be no limitation under this section for recovery of costs or earnings associated with electric generation built to replace a retired coal fired electric generation facility.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any agreement between a public utility and another person for the sale of an otherwise retiring coal fired electric generation facility shall not be effective until approved by the commission. In reviewing the agreement the commission shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether the proposed purchaser has, or has contracted for, financial, technical and managerial abilities sufficient to reasonably operate and maintain the facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether the proposed purchaser has, or has contracted for, financial, technical and managerial abilities sufficient to reasonably decommission and retire the facility if and to the extent the facility is decommissioned and retired;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether the proposed purchaser has, or has contracted for, financial, technical and managerial abilities sufficient to reasonably satisfy any environmental obligations associated with the operation, maintenance or potential retirement of the facility;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If the coal fired electric generation facility is comprised of one (1) or more generation units at a larger power plant where the public utility will continue to own and operate one (1) or more generation units, whether the proposed purchaser and the public utility have made reasonable contractual arrangements for the sharing of the costs associated with any joint or common facilities at the plant;</p>
                  <p>(v) Whether the proposed purchaser has agreed to reasonable terms and conditions for environmental remediation;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Whether the proposed purchase agreement contains a provision allowing the public utility, with commission approval, to revoke the sale in the event the purchaser is unable to timely obtain all necessary local, state and federal permits;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Whether the proposed purchase agreement contains a provision to allow the public utility, with commission approval, to revoke the sale in the event the purchaser is unable to timely enter into any necessary operational and labor agreements;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Whether the proposed purchaser has agreed in the purchase agreement to obtain commission approval prior to transferring, in whole or in part, the facility to any other person so that the commission may ensure that the proposed new purchaser and the new purchase agreement meet the requirements of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(ix) Any other factor deemed appropriate by the commission.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>37-3-201. Limit on natural gas storage; sale of excess; rates; removal of gas for purposes of evading article prohibited.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, no natural gas utility shall include in its rates any charge for any gas maintained in storage in excess of the greater of the amount of stored gas needed to create storage conditions capable of establishing delivery of two and seventy- five hundredths (2.75) times the average annual consumption of natural gas by the tariff customers of that natural gas utility for the immediately preceding three (3) calendar years except the commission may establish a lower limit on the amount of gas in storage upon which a natural gas utility can earn a rate of return or the commission may establish a higher limit on the amount of gas in storage upon which a natural gas utility can earn a rate of return if doing so will reduce rates to customers or prevent likely natural gas shortages or enable the utility to meet peaking requirements.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any natural gas held in storage in excess of the limit specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be included in the gas sold to the utility's Wyoming tariff customers in a manner and at rates as determined by the commission. The commission may include in the gas to be sold to the tariff customers gas upon which no rate of return has been received provided that the inclusion is in the public interest and is requested by the utility. To the extent excess gas in storage on which a rate of return has been received is available, at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the gas sold to the tariff customers shall be from that excess storage unless the utility chooses to include a higher percentage. The utility shall be permitted to earn a rate of return on the excess gas in storage until the gas is sold to customers as provided by this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) No natural gas may be removed from storage or from the rate base for the purposes of evading the requirements of this article.</p>
                  <p>(d) No natural gas held in storage upon which the utility has earned a rate of return shall be sold outside the Wyoming service territory of the utility except by order of the commission after public hearing.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any payment made pursuant to a take or pay contract for gas not taken due to any provision of this act may not be included in any natural gas tariff approved by the public service commission.</p>
                  <p>(f) For the purposes of this article the public service commission may treat utilities which share storage facilities and are subsidiaries controlled by the same company as a single natural gas utility.</p>
                  <p>(g) No provision of this bill shall be implemented unless the public service commission determines that such implementation will not cause increased rates for Wyoming consumers resulting from adverse federal income tax consequences.</p>
                  <p>(h) No provision of this article shall be implemented unless the public service commission determines that the resulting tariff rates will be lower and more in the public interest than the tariff rates which the commission may put into effect through commission action on any pending application before the commission addressing natural gas storage.</p>

                  <p>(viii) Plan, finance, construct, develop, acquire, maintain and operate a pipeline or other transportation and distribution systems within or outside the state of Wyoming to facilitate the production, transportation, distribution and delivery of associated natural resources that are produced or developed in this state, including energy and associated natural resources received as royalties in kind pursuant to mineral leases by the state, its agencies and political subdivisions;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Support efforts to use natural resources associated with energy for other applications and products including the use of coal for nonfuel products.</p>
                  <p>(b) In order to provide for the financing, construction, development, maintenance and operation of energy transmission facilities, pipeline and other transportation and distribution systems, the authority may own, lease or rent facilities, structures and properties, both incidental and necessary, constructed in accordance with this article and article 6 of this chapter, to facilitate the production, development, transportation, distribution and delivery of energy and associated natural resources.</p>

                  <p>(f) Except as provided in this section, the authority shall not exercise any of the rights or powers granted to it in this section if private persons, firms or corporations are performing the acts, constructing or have constructed the facilities or are providing the services contemplated by the authority.</p>

                  <p>(a) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 49, ยง 2.</p>
                  <p>(b) The authority may issue and have outstanding bonds to finance energy transmission facilities and related infrastructure, pipeline and other transportation and distribution projects consistent with the purposes of W.S. 37-5- 503(a), which may be located within or without the state of Wyoming, in an amount not to exceed three billion dollars ($3,000,000,000.00). The financing of a pipeline or other transportation and distribution projects under this article may include or consist solely of the purchase of capacity by the authority as authorized by subsection (m) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The principal amount of any bonds that have been retired, redeemed, defeased or refunded by the authority need not be taken into account in computing compliance with the maximum amounts of bonds authorized to be issued under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Subject to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the authority may issue bonds in principal amounts the authority determines necessary to provide sufficient funds for achieving its purposes under this article, including the reduction of principal, the payment of interest, the establishment of reserves, the costs of administration and for the purpose of defraying all other associated costs. All bonds issued under this article are negotiable instruments under the laws of this state unless expressly provided to the contrary on the face of the bonds. The authority may enter into contracts to insure the payment of principal and interest, for interest rate exchange contracts and for financial guarantees to lower the cost of its borrowing.</p>
                  <p>(e) All bonds issued by the authority are payable solely out of special funds consisting of all or part of its revenues, receipts, monies and assets, as designated in the proceedings under which the bonds are authorized. All bonds shall bear interest at fixed or variable rates, be executed and delivered at times and in denominations, be of terms and maturities, be in registered form as to principal and interest or principal alone, and bear manual or facsimile signatures and seals as the authority determines. Bonds issued by the authority are not general obligations of this state nor of any political subdivision of this state.

                  <p>(f) Bonds may be payable in installments and may bear maturities not exceeding forty (40) years from the date issued as the authority determines.</p>
                  <p>(g) Bonds and interest may be payable at a time or place whether within or outside the state, as the authority determines. Bonds may contain other provisions not inconsistent with this article.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any bonds that the authority issues may contain an option to redeem all or any part as may be specified. The price of redemption, the terms and conditions and the procedure of notice shall be set forth by the authority and may appear on the face of the bonds.</p>
                  <p>(j) Any bonds of the authority may be sold at, above or below par value, at public or private sale, in a manner and from time to time as determined by the authority. The authority may pay legal fees, expenses, premiums and commissions that it finds necessary or advantageous to this state in connection with the issuance and sale.</p>
                  <p>(k) The authority may provide for the issuance of bonds to refund any bonds of the authority then outstanding, including for the payment of any redemption premium and any interest or premium accrued or to accrue to, the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase or maturity of the bonds. The authority may also refund bonds issued by the Wyoming pipeline authority under W.S. 37-5-201 through 37-5-208 and the Wyoming infrastructure authority under W.S. 37-5-401 through 37-5-408 before July 1, 2020. Refunding shall be accomplished in the manner prescribed by W.S. 16-5-101 through 16-5-119 to the extent it is not inconsistent with this article.</p>
                  <p>(m) The authority may acquire, purchase, make prepayments for, finance, hold, use, lease, license, sell, transfer and dispose of an undivided or other interest in or the right to capacity in any pipeline or other transportation or distribution system within or without the state of Wyoming. The authority may acquire, purchase, make prepayments for proven developed reserves, hold, use, lease, license, sell, transfer and dispose of an undivided or other interest in natural resources associated with energy, including royalties taken in kind. The powers specified in this subsection may be exercised in order to facilitate the production, transportation, distribution or delivery of associated natural resources produced or developed in this state. The authority is exempt from the provisions of W.S. 37-5-503(g) when exercising the powers granted by this article.</p>

                  <p>(a) The principal and interest on any bonds that the authority issues shall be secured by a pledge of revenues from the operation of the pipeline or other transportation or distribution system or energy transmission project financed, by a first mortgage on the facilities, by guarantees and pledges of the entity owning the project, pipeline or system, or of the parent corporation owning said entity or by any combination thereof or other security as the authority may determine to be reasonable and prudent. The guarantees and pledges shall be no less favorable to the authority than those granted other lenders of the same class.</p>
                  <p>(b) The authority may require additional payments, as negotiated, to bondholders to be made either in a lump sum at the time of retirement of the bonds or annually from the time of retirement of the bonds until project, pipeline or system use is terminated or may require additional incentives from the owner of the project or pipeline to prospective bondholders so long as the incentives are not contrary to the Wyoming constitution.</p>
                  <p>(c) The authority may require such other security for repayment of the bonds as it deems necessary.</p>
                  <p>(d) Each pledge, agreement, mortgage or other instrument made for the benefit or security of any bonds of the authority is valid and binding from the time when made. The revenues, receipts, monies and assets pledged are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without delivery or further act. The lien is valid and binding against persons having claims of any kind against the authority whether or not the persons have actual notice of the lien. The resolution or the indenture or other instrument by which a pledge is created need not be recorded or filed.</p>

                  <p>(i) The name of the proposed power district;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The necessity of the proposed work, describing the necessity and attaching such certificate of necessity issued by the public service commission thereto;</p>

Several similar petitions for the organization of the same district may be circulated, and when filed, shall together be regarded as one petition having as many signers as there are separate signers on the several petitions filed. All petitions for the organization of said district filed prior to the hearing on said petition shall be considered by the court, the same as if filed with the first petition placed on file, and the signatures thereon contained shall be counted in determining whether sufficient persons have signed said petition.</p>

                  <p>(a) Assessments to meet expenses of any current year of any district shall become due, payable and delinquent at such time or times each year as may be fixed by law for state and county taxes to become due, payable and delinquent. Commissioners having charge of any power district shall on or before the first Tuesday of June of each year file with the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of such district, a report showing an itemized estimate of the money to be raised by assessment within the district for the purpose of constructing new work, maintenance, and to meet the yearly current expenses of the district. In addition to the amount above provided, the commissioners may add a sum which in their judgment shall be sufficient to provide for possible delinquencies. Within thirty (30) days after filing such annual report, at a time and place to be fixed by the court or a judge thereof, the judge shall examine such report, hear all objections thereto, fix and determine the amount to be raised by assessments for the current year and cause such adjudication to be entered of record in said court and a certified copy thereof to be delivered to the commissioners of such district. The commissioners shall add thereto such amount as may be necessary to meet the principal and interest on lawful indebtedness of the district maturing during the current year, together with a sum which in their judgment shall be sufficient to provide for possible delinquencies. When thus completed it shall be known as "The Budget of .... District for the year (year)" and also be verified under oath by any one of the commissioners.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioners of any power district within the state of Wyoming are hereby forbidden to incur any indebtedness for the current expenses of the district in excess of the amount provided in the budget. Provided, however, in case a greater sum than that provided in the budget is required, the commissioners may file a petition setting forth the causes therefor, with the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of said district. Immediately upon the filing of said petition the court shall make an order fixing the time and place of hearing and directing the form and manner of notice thereof to be given if the court deem such hearing advisable. If the court shall authorize the expenditure of a greater sum of money the commissioners shall be authorized to incur indebtedness equal to the amount of the additional sum authorized by the court, and in case the expenditure occurs at a time when it is too late to place the amount upon the assessment roll for the current year such amounts may be added to the budget of ensuing years. All debts contracted in contravention of this section shall be void.</p>

                  <p>It shall be the duty of the commissioners of each power district on or before the third Monday in July in each year to prepare an assessment roll of said district which shall contain the name of the owner together with the description of each lot, tract and easement of land within said district and the aggregate assessment of benefits confirmed by the court against the same. Assessments to meet the current expense of a power district for any year shall be proportioned upon the assessed valuation of the several benefited lots, tracts and easements in the district as such valuation was last fixed for assessment purposes by the county assessor and county board of equalization of the county in which the same are situated. The assessment roll shall also show the amount assessed against each lot, tract, and easement of land in the district to meet the principal and interest or the indebtedness of the district for the current year. When such assessment roll is completed it shall be signed by the commissioners of said district and verified by any one of them. The county commissioners of said county upon the receipt of the assessment roll of said district and at the time of making the requisite tax levy for county purposes, shall levy and assess against each lot, tract, and easement of land the respective amounts levied and assessed against the same on said assessment roll. Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county and in case the territory embraced in such district is located in two (2) or more counties a copy of the assessment roll as certified to by the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such district shall be delivered to the assessor of each county in which any of the land of the district is located. Upon receipt of the assessment roll the assessors of the counties embracing any of the lands of such district, shall extend upon the tax roll of such county the respective amounts levied and assessed against each lot, tract, and easement of land, and against each corporation as shown by said assessment roll of said district.</p>

For the purpose of providing funds to pay such refunding bonds with interest thereon, the commissioners may levy assessments against the land in such district, but not in excess of the benefits assessed. In the alternative the commissioners may, if they deem it advisable, issue said refunding bonds in an amount sufficient only to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, and delinquencies in the payment of assessments levied, from year to year, assessments against the land in such district for such purposes, but not in excess of the benefits assessed against the same.</p>

                  <p>(a) Every operator shall file with the notification center a general description of the area served together with the name, address and telephone number of the person from whom necessary information may be obtained concerning the location of underground facilities.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any person preparing or designing architectural or engineering design drawings that call for excavation shall comply with W.S. 37-12-307.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as hereafter provided, no excavator shall make or begin excavation without first notifying the notification center of the proposed excavation. Notice shall be given by telephone, e-mail, fax or other electronic medium approved by the notification center at least two (2) full business days, but not more than fourteen (14) business days prior to any excavation to the notification center pursuant to W.S. 37-12-304. If an excavation on a single project lasts more than fourteen (14) business days, the excavator shall give notice at least once each succeeding fourteen (14) business day period. Notice to the notification center is notice to each member thereof in the area. Notification of the following information to the notification center shall be required and shall include the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Name of the person notifying the notification center;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Name, address and telephone number of the excavator;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Specific location by legal description or other reliable method that allows for current and accurate means of identifying geographic locations, and starting date and description of the intended activity.</p>
                  <p>(d) An operator shall at its expense, upon receipt of the notice provided for in subsection (c) of this section, use reasonable care to mark the location of the underground facilities with stakes, flags, paint or by other clearly identifiable marking within twenty-four (24) inches horizontally from the exterior sides of the operator's underground facilities. The location shall be marked using American Public Works Association uniform color standards. If requested by the excavator, the operator receiving the notice shall advise the excavator of the nature, location, size, function and depth if known, of underground facilities in the proposed excavation area. The operator shall respond no later than two (2) full business days after receipt of the notice from the notification center or at a time otherwise mutually agreed to by the operator and excavator.</p>
                  <p>(e) Emergency excavations are exempt from the time constraints of the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) If information required pursuant to subsection (d) of this section is not provided within the time specified therein, or if the information provided fails to identify the location of the underground facilities in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, then any excavator damaging or injuring underground facilities shall not be liable for such damage or injury except when failing to utilize reasonable care. However, if information required pursuant to subsection (d) of this section is provided within the time specified therein, and if the information provided sufficiently identifies the location of the underground facilities in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, then any excavator damaging or injuring underground facilities shall be liable for all damage or injury to persons or property.</p>
                  <p>(g) Compliance with this section does not excuse an excavator from exercising reasonable care in complying with this act nor does compliance with this section excuse an excavator from liability for damage or injury for failure to so act. When excavating, reasonable care shall require hand digging or soft digging, as necessary, to protect the underground facility.</p>
                  <p>(h) When any contact with or damage to any underground facility occurs, the excavator shall first immediately call a 911 emergency reporting system as defined by W.S. 16-9- 102(a)(iv) and request emergency services if the contacted or damaged underground facility releases gas or a hazardous liquid. In all cases the excavator shall immediately notify the operator of the facility and the notification center, of the location of and extent of damage to the underground facility and shall cooperate with the operator of the damaged underground facility to mitigate the damages incurred to the extent reasonably possible, including the provision of in-kind work where technical or special skills are not required according to the nature of the underground facility. An excavator shall not conceal or attempt to conceal any dislocation, disturbance or damage to an underground facility and shall not repair or attempt to repair the underground facility unless authorized by the operator of the underground facility. Upon notification of damage to an underground facility from an excavator, the operator of the underground facility shall respond to the notification in a manner reasonably appropriate to the circumstances. The operator shall file a report with the notification center describing the response within seventy-two (72) hours of the initial notification. This requirement of notification shall not relieve the excavator and the operator from compliance with any other state or federal notification obligation. In any dispute concerning the liability for damages to any underground facility, the excavator shall bear the burden of proof concerning its use of reasonable care in conducting the excavation.</p>

                  <p>(m) Unless an exception in this subsection is applicable, an excavator shall mark the location of the area or path of excavation before the arrival of an operator or agent of an operator to locate their underground facility. The obligations of an operator specified by W.S. 37-12-302(d) shall not apply until an excavator has complied with the requirements of this subsection. Markings may include stakes, flags, marking whiskers, white paint, signage, electronic white lining on digital mapping or any other identifiable marking that clearly marks the location of the area or path of excavation, provided that any marking used cannot be confused with the accepted American National Standards Institute Standard Z535.1 safety color code. An excavator need not premark the location as required by this section if any of the following apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is only one (1) operator with underground facilities in the proposed excavation area and the operator or the operator's agent can determine the location of the area or path of excavation by street address, lot number, global positioning system, latitude and longitude coordinates, mapping or other method agreed to by the excavator and operator;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The excavator and operator had a meeting at the proposed excavation area before beginning the proposed excavation and exchanged the information on the location of the area or path of excavation as specified in paragraph (i) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The proposed excavation is of an emergency nature;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A different method of locating or defining the area or path of excavation has been agreed to by the excavator and all operators within the proposed excavation area.</p>
                  <p>(n) An operator of an underground facility that the operator determines to be within an area of risk may provide to the county in which the underground facility is located written notice that includes a description of the underground facility and the specific location of the underground facility by map, legal description or other reliable method that allows for a current and accurate means of identifying the geographic location of the underground facility. Any notice under this subsection shall be provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) Except as specified in paragraph (ii) of this subsection, not later than June 1, 2020 and then January 31 of each year thereafter;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For an operator of a newly installed underground facility, within sixty (60) days of installation of the underground facility.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>37-13-105. Basis of assessments.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Whenever any improvement authorized to be made by any governing body by the terms of this chapter is ordered, the governing body shall apportion the cost and expenses thereof as in their judgment is fair and equitable in consideration of the benefits accruing to the lots and land included within the improvement district. Each lot or parcel of land shall be separately assessed for the cost and expenses in proportion to the number of square feet of such lot or parcel compared to the total number of square feet included in the improvement district, or assessed upon a frontage, zone or other equitable basis in accordance with the benefits accruing to the property by the improvements, as the same may be determined by the governing body. The entire cost of the improvement shall be assessed against the benefited property. If money for paying part of the costs is available from any other source, in which [that] event the money so available may be applied to reduce the assessment.</p>
                <p>(b) The cost and expenses to be assessed shall include:</p>
                <p>(i) The conversion costs as determined by W.S. 37-13-129 or as estimated by the public utility, whichever is less;</p>
                <p>(ii) Engineering services;</p>
                <p>(iii) Clerical services;</p>
                <p>(iv) Advertising expenses;</p>
                <p>(v) Costs of inspection;</p>
                <p>(vi) Costs of collecting assessments;</p>
                <p>(vii) Interest upon bonds if issued;</p>
                <p>(viii) Costs for legal services for preparing proceedings and advising in regard thereto; and</p>

                <p>(a) Any governing body may upon a petition signed by at least sixty percent (60%) of the resident owners of property subject to assessment owning at least sixty percent (60%) of the assessable land of any proposed district, adopt a resolution at any regular or special meeting declaring that it finds that the improvement district is in the public interest. It must be determined that the formation of the local improvement district will promote the public convenience, necessity, and welfare. The resolution must state that the costs and expenses will be levied and assessed upon the property benefited and request that each public utility serving the proposed district by overhead electric or communication facilities shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the resolution, make a study of the cost of conversion of its facilities in the area to underground service. The results of the study shall be provided to the governing body and made available in its office to all owners of land within the proposed district. The resolution of the governing body shall require that the public utilities be provided with the name and address of the owner of each parcel or lot within the proposed district, if known, and if not known the description of the property and other matters as may be required by the public utility in order to perform the work involved in the cost study. Each public utility serving the proposed district by overhead electric or communication facilities shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the resolution, make a study of the costs of conversion of its facilities in the district to underground service, and shall together provide the governing body and make available at its office a joint report as to the results of the study.</p>
                <p>(b) At any time prior to the hearing provided for in W.S. 37-13-111 of the statutes, if requested by the governing body or public utility, a bond shall be filed, with security approved by the governing body or cash deposit made sufficient to pay all expenses of the governing body connected with the proceedings and of the public utilities for actual time and expenses incurred in regard to the cost and feasibility study in case the organization of the district is not effected. If at any time during the organization proceedings the governing body shall be satisfied that the bond first executed or the amount of cash deposited is insufficient in amount, it on its own initiative or at the request of a public utility may require the execution of an additional bond or the deposit of additional cash within a time to be fixed, not less than ten (10) days distant, and upon failure of the petitioners to file or deposit the same, the petition shall be dismissed.</p>

                <p>The public utility or utilities report shall set forth an estimate of the total underground conversion costs for the district and shall also indicate the cost of underground conversion of facilities of the public utility located within the boundaries of the various parcels or lots within the district. The report shall also contain the public utility's recommendations concerning the engineering feasibility of the project for the district proposed insofar as the physical characteristics of the district are concerned. The report shall make recommendations by the public utility concerning inclusion or exclusion of areas within the district or immediately adjacent to the district. The governing body shall consider the public utility's recommendations concerning feasibility and may amend the boundaries of the proposed improvement district provided the costs and feasibility report of the public utilities contains a cost figure on the district as amended, or it may request a new costs and feasibility report from the public utilities concerned on the basis of the amended district. The cost estimate contained in the report shall not be considered binding on the public utility if construction is not commenced within six (6) months of the submission of the estimate for reasons not within the control of the public utility. Should such a delay result in a significant increase in the conversion cost, new hearings shall be held on the creation of the district. In the event that a ten percent (10%) or less increase results, only the hearing on the assessments need be held again.</p>

                <p>Notice shall also be mailed to each owner of real property whose property will be assessed for part of the cost of the improvement at the last known address of the owner as shown on the last completed real property assessment rolls of the county wherein the affected property is located. In addition, a copy of the notice shall be addressed and mailed to "owner" at the street number of each piece of property affected by the assessment. Each notice shall state that at the specified time and place the governing body will hold a hearing upon the proposed assessments and that the owner of any property to be assessed pursuant to the resolution will be heard on the question of whether his property will be benefited by the proposed improvement to the amount of the proposed assessment against his property and whether the amount assessed against his property constitutes more than his proper proportional share of the total cost of the improvement. The notice shall further state that the owner or owners of any property assessed must file a written objection pursuant to section 37-303 [ ยง 37-13- 131] of the statutes if the owner or owners wish to do the trenching and backfilling on their own property outside of utility easements and thereby not be obligated to pay the public utility therefor, if such is permitted by the district and public utility tariff. The notice shall further state where a copy of the proposed resolution levying the assessments against all real property in the district is on file for public inspection, and that subject to such changes and corrections as may be made by the governing body, it is proposed to adopt the resolution at the conclusion of the hearing. The published notice shall describe the boundaries or area of the district with sufficient particularity to permit each owner of real property therein to ascertain that his property lies in the district. The mailed notice may refer to the district by name and date of creation and shall state the amount of the assessment proposed to be levied against the real property of the person to whom the notice is mailed. In the absence of fraud, the failure to mail any notice does not invalidate any assessment or any proceeding under this chapter.</p>

                <p>(a) At the time and place specified in the assessment hearing notice, the governing body shall hear all arguments relating to the benefits accruing to any tract, lot or parcel of land therein and the amounts proposed to be assessed against any tract, lot or parcel. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time to a fixed future time and place. After the hearing has been concluded and all persons desiring to be heard have been heard, the governing body shall consider the arguments presented and shall make the corrections in the assessment list as may be considered just and equitable. The corrections may eliminate, increase, or decrease the amount of the assessment proposed to be levied against any piece of property. However, no increase of any proposed assessment shall be valid unless the owner of the property is given notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>
                <p>(b) After the corrections have been made, the governing body shall make a specific finding that no proposed assessment on the corrected assessment list exceeds the benefit to be derived from the improvement by the piece of property to be assessed and that no piece of property listed will bear more than its proper proportionate share of the cost of the improvement.</p>

                <p>After the public hearing has been concluded and all corrections made to the assessment list, the governing body shall proceed to adopt the assessment resolution. The resolution and supporting findings shall be conclusive against all persons unless an action contesting the validity of this law or the acts contemplated by this law shall be commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction within thirty (30) days after the adoption of the assessment ordinance. Thereafter, any such action shall be barred and the organization of the district, the assessment levied pursuant thereto, or any other act authorized by this statute shall not be directly or collaterally questioned in any suit, action, or proceeding. The statute of limitations provided herein shall be an additional limitation to and supplement any requirements of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act or any rules issued thereunder. If the contest is unsuccessful, the court may order the plaintiff to pay the costs thereof, and, in its discretion, may require a bond in a sufficient amount to cover the costs at the commencement of the action. The burden of proof to show that the special assessment or part thereof is invalid, inequitable or unjust shall rest upon the party who brings the suit.</p>

In addition, the person must pay the additional amount of interest as in the opinion of the governing body is necessary to assure the availability of money fully sufficient to pay interest on the bonds as interest becomes due, and any redemption premiums which may become payable on the bonds in order to retire, in advance of maturity, bonds in a sufficient amount to utilize the assessments thus paid in advance. If no bonds have been issued then all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may be paid in their entirety prior to the date upon which they become due by paying the principal amount due and the interest accrued thereon to the date of payment.</p>

The bonds shall bear interest payable semiannually or annually and shall mature serially over a period not exceeding twenty (20) years, but in no event shall the bonds extend over a longer period of time than the period of time over which the installments of special assessments are due and payable and ninety (90) days thereafter. The bonds shall be of a form and denomination and shall be payable in principal and interest at times and places and shall be sold, authorized and issued in a manner, as the governing body may determine. The bonds shall be dated no earlier than the date on which the special assessment shall begin to bear interest and shall be secured by and payable from the irrevocable pledge of the funds derived from the levy and collection of the special assessments in anticipation of the collection of which they are issued. Any premium received on the sale of the bonds shall be placed in the fund for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The bonds shall be callable for redemption from the proceeds of the sale of property sold for the nonpayment of special assessments but not otherwise unless the bonds on the face thereof provide for redemption prior to maturity. The governing body may provide that the bonds shall be redeemable on interest payment date or dates prior to maturity pursuant to notice and at premiums as it deems advisable. The bonds shall be signed by a member of the governing body designated by the governing body and shall be countersigned by the city recorder or the clerk of the board of the town trustees or the clerk of the board of the county commissioners, whichever is applicable, and one (1) of the signatures may be a facsimile signature.

Whenever any enactment authorizing the issuance of any bonds pursuant to the improvement contemplated is adopted, the resolution shall be published once in a newspaper in which the original notice of hearing was published.

This shall include the digging and backfilling of a trench upon the lot or parcel unless the owner executes and files a written objection with the clerk of the governing body not later than the date set for hearing objections to the improvement district assessment as provided by law. Failure to file the written objection shall be taken as a consent and grant of easement to the utility and shall be construed as express authority to the public utility and their respective officers, agents and employees to enter upon the lot or parcel for such purpose, and through failure to object, any right of protest or objection in respect of the doing of such work shall be waived. If an owner does file the written objection, he shall be responsible for providing a trench in accordance with applicable rules, regulations or tariffs from the owner's service entrance to a point designated by the public utility and for backfilling the trench following installation of the underground service by the public utility involved.</p>
                <p>(b) If conversion costs for the service facilities located upon any lot or parcel of land and not within the easement for distribution are included in tariffs, rules or regulations filed with or promulgated by the public service commission, the conversion costs shall be the costs included in the costs and feasibility report, and the property owner shall be obligated for that amount.</p>
                <p>(c) In any event the cost of any work done by the public utility shall be included in the assessment to be levied upon the lot or parcel. If a written objection is filed as above provided, the owner involved is obligated for and the public utility involved is entitled to payment for the actual cost for the work accomplished upon the owner's property by the public utility.</p>

In no event shall the bill for conversion cost presented by the public utility corporation exceed the amount of estimated conversion costs by the public utility corporation. If the conversion costs are less than the estimated conversion costs, each owner within the improvement district shall receive the benefit, prorated in such form and at such time or times as the governing body may determine to be fair and equitable. The bill of the public utility corporation shall be paid within thirty (30) days by the governing body from the improvement district funds or such other source as is properly designated by the governing body.

If such petition is granted, the otherwise eligible company will be permitted to receive universal service support for the duration of the period designated by the commission. The commission shall grant such a request only upon a finding that exceptional circumstances prevent an otherwise eligible company from providing single-party service, access to enhanced 911 service or toll limitation. The period should extend only as long as the commission finds that exceptional circumstances exist and shall not extend beyond the time that the commission deems necessary for that company to complete network upgrades. An otherwise eligible company that is incapable of offering one (1) or more of these three (3) specific supported services must demonstrate to the commission that exceptional circumstances exist with respect to each service for which the carrier desires a grant of additional time to complete network upgrades.</p>
                  <p>(xvii) "Landline carrier" means a telecommunications company providing local exchange service, or its functional equivalent, to retail end users by means primarily of its own fiber, copper, electric lines or coaxial cable facilities.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>37-15-202. Determination of competitive services.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Upon petition by any telecommunications company or pursuant to the commission's own motion, the commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, find and conclude that a telecommunications service is subject to competition. Any service found to be effectively competitive pursuant to this section shall not be subject to regulation by the commission. The commission shall consider only the following factors in determining whether a telecommunications service is subject to effective competition:</p>
                  <p>(i) The extent to which telecommunications services are available from alternative providers including, but not limited to, wireless providers, satellite providers, cable providers offering voice services, voice over internet protocol or any other providers utilizing telephone numbers to provide voice services in the relevant market;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The extent to which telecommunications services of alternative providers are functionally equivalent, for equivalent service or in combination with other services, and may be substituted at reasonably comparable prices, terms and conditions;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Existing economic, regulatory or technological barriers to entry.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon the commission's own motion or the petition of any person, the commission may, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, find and conclude that a telecommunications service found to be competitive under subsection (a) of this section is no longer subject to competition, and therefore not subject to treatment as a competitive service under this chapter. All hearings conducted pursuant to this subsection shall place the burden of proof upon the commission or the petitioner of establishing that a telecommunications service is no longer subject to competition.</p>
                  <p>(c) Telecommunications service provided by new entrants, local exchange services provided by resale, telecommunications services provided by interexchange telecommunications companies, interexchange telecommunications services and telecommunications services other than local exchange service and switched access provided by a local exchange company shall be considered subject to competition for purpose of regulation under this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, local exchange service may be determined to be competitive pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section the commission shall, in an area defined by an applicant, find retail telecommunications services other than switched access are competitive provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the class of customers in the area have access to at least one (1) landline carrier unaffiliated with the applicant providing local voice service. The local voice service may be provided in combination with other services. If a company does not differentiate between residential and business classes of service in its application, the requirement shall be that at least sixty percent (60%), considering residential and business customers as one (1) class of customers, have access to at least one (1) landline carrier unaffiliated with the applicant;</p>
                  <p>(ii) At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the class of customers in the area have access to at least one (1) wireless provider unaffiliated with the applicant. If a company does not differentiate between residential and business classes of service in its application, the requirement shall be that at least sixty percent (60%), considering residential and business customers as one (1) class of customers, have access to at least one (1) wireless provider unaffiliated with the applicant;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The applicant specifies in the application whether or not the class of customers whose service is to be determined competitive are residential, business or both;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The applicant agrees to provide throughout the area prices which do not vary by geographic location or access to competitors;</p>
                  <p>(v) The applicant agrees, if residential services are involved and subject to the provisions of subsections (e) and</p>
                  <p>(f) of this section, to continue to provide stand alone basic residential local exchange service at a price less than the price for the stand alone basic residential local exchange service bundled with any other service; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) The applicant agrees for a transition period ending July 1, 2009 to provide stand alone basic residential service at a price that does not exceed the price in effect July 1, 2006 and agrees after July 1, 2009 that it will not increase the price for the stand alone basic residential local exchange service by an amount that exceeds the price in effect July 1, 2008, by more than the cumulative increase in the federal gross domestic product price index since July 1, 2008. For the purpose of this subsection the prices in effect July 1, 2006 and July 1, 2009 shall be modified only to reflect changes in access charges as approved by the commission pursuant to W.S. 37-15-203(f)(ii) and (j) to the extent those changes are not reflected in the rates.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the price for stand alone basic residential local exchange service is restricted pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the commission may, upon application and after notice and opportunity for hearing, authorize an increase in the price for the service if the applicant demonstrates that the maximum price allowed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section would not allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to recover its prudently incurred costs related to the proportion of the property used in providing the essential telecommunications service.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a company is required to continue to offer stand alone basic residential local exchange service pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, it may apply to the commission for permission to stop offering the service. The commission shall, after notice and opportunity for hearing approve the application if:</p>
                  <p>(i) A successor agrees to continue the obligation; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The company establishes to the satisfaction of the commission that the service has become obsolete due to a lack of customers subscribing to the service.</p>
                  <p>(g) The commission may, on its own motion or upon application by the office of consumer advocate or by any interested party, find retail telecommunications services are not competitive in any area where it has previously found them to be competitive pursuant to subsection (d) of this section if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Due to merger, acquisition, predatory pricing or marketing practices or withdrawal of offerings, the degree of competition required by subsection (d) of this section no longer exists; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The local exchange telecommunications provider has not complied with the conditions it agreed to pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(h) Nothing in this section affects or modifies:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any applicable wholesale tariff or any commission authority to implement or enforce any rights, duties or obligations of any party related to wholesale services;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any entity's obligations or rights or commission authority under the Federal Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 251 and 252;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any commission jurisdiction over intrastate switched access rates, terms and conditions, including the implementation of federal law with respect to intercarrier compensation;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any commission jurisdiction or authority pursuant to W.S. 37-15-401(a)(vii), including commission jurisdiction or authority to address federal high cost fund or federal universal service fund issues.</p>
                  <p>(j) Services found to be competitive under subsection (a),</p>
                  <p>(c) or (d) of this section shall be subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any required assessments under W.S. 37-15-501 and 37-15-502;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any required assessment of 911 or E911 emergency service taxes as provided in title 16, chapter 9, article 1 of the Wyoming statutes;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any required special fee under W.S. 16-9-209;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any required assessment levied under W.S. 37-2-106 through 37-2-109;</p>

                  <p>(a) Prices for telecommunications services which have been determined by the legislature or the commission to be noncompetitive essential telecommunications services shall be regulated by the commission in accordance with this section.</p>
                  <p>The prices for noncompetitive essential telecommunications services of any local exchange company may be adjusted downward at the company's discretion. Except as provided in subsections (e), (f), (h) and (j) of this section, prices for noncompetitive essential telecommunications services shall be subject to a maximum determined by the commission. The initial maximum shall be the local exchange company's price of noncompetitive essential telecommunications services as of July 1, 2006. A local exchange carrier may increase its price for noncompetitive essential telecommunications services to the level of the maximum set under this subsection without approval of the commission as required under subsections (f) and (g) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(e) A local exchange company may seek approval to make revenue neutral adjustments, considering only revenue from noncompetitive essential telecommunications services, to the price of noncompetitive essential telecommunications services to reduce or eliminate differences in the price of noncompetitive essential telecommunications services in different portions of its service area. A local exchange company shall not use adjustments under this section to increase receipt of state universal service funds or increase switched access prices. This subsection shall not apply retroactively.</p>
                  <p>(f) A local exchange company may seek approval to increase the price of noncompetitive essential telecommunications services, including switched access charges, based on:</p>
                  <p>(i) Changes in the local calling area as approved by the commission;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Changes in access charges as approved by the commission;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Other changes affecting noncompetitive essential telecommunications services; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) Increases in the cost of providing telecommunications services. The increases shall be judged on the overall federal gross domestic product price index published by the United States department of commerce, bureau of economic analysis unless the applicant demonstrates that specific cost increases are disproportionably affecting the cost of providing their noncompetitive essential services.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any requested price change under subsections (b) through (f) of this section, including revenue neutral changes, that may result in an increase in the price of noncompetitive essential telecommunications services is subject to review and determination by the commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing.</p>
                  <p>(h) The prices of any local exchange company may contain provisions for incentives for improvement of the company's performance or efficiency, lowering of operating costs, control of expenses or improvement and upgrading or modernization of its services or facilities. Any local exchange company may apply to the commission for incentives and innovative or nontraditional price regulation, including price indexing. The commission shall issue a final order approving, modifying or rejecting any application made under this subsection within one hundred eighty (180) days of the filing date of the application with the commission. If no order is issued by the commission within the one hundred eighty (180) day period, the application shall be deemed approved as filed. If during consideration of an application for regulation under this subsection, the commission materially alters the plan as filed in the application, the applying local exchange company may notify the commission in writing, at any time, but not later than sixty (60) days after any final commission order on the application, that it elects not to be price regulated as approved by the order. The local exchange company's prices shall then be regulated as they were prior to the application until such time as a new application is filed, approved and accepted.</p>
                  <p>(j) Unless as otherwise directed under federal law, noncompetitive switched access shall not be priced above three cents ($.03) per minute after January 1, 2010.</p>

                  <p>(a) No person shall engage in any practice which has the effect of changing any Wyoming consumer's telecommunications company if the change is willfully made without the knowledge and consent of that consumer. No person shall willfully charge or attempt to collect charges from any Wyoming consumer for any product or service not provided to the consumer or not authorized by the consumer. The public service commission shall provide upon request of a Wyoming consumer, information or technical assistance regarding appropriate action for the consumer to take in order not to receive telecommunication companies solicitations.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any change in a Wyoming consumerโs telecommunications company shall be effective only if it is in compliance with any method of authorization permitted under federal law, rule or regulation, except that no negative option marketing technique shall be permitted to be used.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the chosen method is a letter of agency it shall be maintained by the new service provider. No letter of agency under subsection (b) of this section shall be effective if it is physically attached to or part of any inducement, premium, coupon or other promotional material. No letter of agency shall be effective until it is in the actual possession of the new service provider.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any consumer whose telecommunications company has been willfully changed in violation of subsection (a) of this section is not liable for payment of any unauthorized charge unless the commission determines, after conducting a public hearing on any complaint brought on the matter, that the consumer engaged in any fraudulent or deceptive practice which avoids payment for telecommunications services in connection with the unauthorized charge.</p>
                  <p>(e) A consumer is not liable for an amount charged for any unauthorized product provided or service initiated by a telecommunications company or its billing agent without the consent of the consumer. No consumer shall be liable to pay for any product not delivered or service not furnished.</p>
                  <p>(f) Restitution for violation of this section shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The unauthorized telecommunications company shall pay all recurring and nonrecurring fees and charges necessary for the consumer to promptly reinstate service from the original telecommunications company and shall pay that company an amount equal to that which would have been due had the consumer remained with the original telecommunications company;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In addition to paragraph (f)(i) of this section, the unauthorized telecommunications company shall pay to any consumer any amount the consumer has paid to the unauthorized company for which the consumer is not liable under subsection</p>
                  <p>(d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the commission shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence in a hearing that any person willfully has engaged in any practice which has the effect of changing any Wyoming consumer's telecommunications company without complying with the applicable provisions of this section, has charged or attempted to collect a charge for unauthorized service, or has solicited a Wyoming consumer in violation of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) The commission may impose for each change or charge made in violation of this section an administrative penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); and</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the commission finds that the person has violated this section with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice it may also permanently revoke the authority of the company involved to provide intrastate interexchange or other telecommunications services in this state.</p>
                  <p>(h) The following are not subject to the provisions of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) Changes in a consumer's telecommunications company or other services effected through a consolidation or merger of the consumer's current telecommunications company;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Services and corresponding charges required by law or order of the commission.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Have submitted a written request to all private providers of telecommunications services within the boundaries of the city, town or political subdivision for provision of the same quality and grade of telecommunications service within the same time frame and at the same consumer prices proposed under the exclusive contract;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Determine, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing that the private telecommunications service providers have not agreed within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the request submitted pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subsection to provide the same quality and grade of service within the same time frame and at the same consumer prices as proposed under the exclusive contract, or if the provider has agreed, that the provider has not commenced providing or constructing facilities to provide the service in the manner agreed upon; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Limit the term of any exclusive agreement under this section to not more than six (6) years.</p>

                  <p>(c) Nothing in this section shall restrict the governing body of a city or town, or other political subdivision, from providing a telecommunications service or facility:</p>
                  <p>(i) For its own use;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For 911, E-911 or other emergency services;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For medical or educational purposes; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) To students by an educational institution.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the governing body of a city or town or other political subdivision, from providing a telecommunications service to a party within the geographic area in which the city, town or political subdivision operates as a telecommunications utility. Any city, town or political subdivision providing a telecommunications service under this subsection shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide the telecommunications service on a nondiscriminatory, nonexclusive and competitively neutral basis; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide the telecommunications service at a price which covers cost, including imputed costs that the city, town or political subdivision would incur if it were a for- profit telecommunications company.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any person may complain to the commission, and the commission may on its own motion initiate an investigation, concerning any alleged violation of this section by a city, town or political subdivision, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the commission finds that a city, town or political subdivision has violated this section, or finds that any rule, action or order of a city, town or political subdivision is anticompetitive or otherwise violates this section, the commission shall notify the city, town or political subdivision of the violation. The city, town or political subdivision shall cure the anticompetitive behavior within ninety (90) days following mailing of notice by the commission; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the city, town or political subdivision does not cure the anticompetitive behavior within ninety (90) days, the commission shall commence a contested case hearing on the complaint, governed by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, W.S. 16-3-101 et seq. If, following the hearing, the commission finds that the city, town or political subdivision has violated this section, the commission shall prohibit the city, town or political subdivision from providing any telecommunications service until the violation of this section is remedied.</p>
                  <p>(f) This section does not apply to any contract entered into prior to July 1, 2007.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>37-15-501. Universal service fund created; contributions; administration.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) There is hereby established the universal service fund to be administered in accordance with this section. The fund shall be administered by the commission. All telecommunications companies shall contribute to the universal service fund. The dates for contributions to the fund and disbursements from the fund shall be set by the commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, as necessary to accomplish the objectives of the fund as specified in subsections (c) and (d) of this section. The costs of administering the fund may be included in determining required contributions.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commission shall after notice and opportunity for hearing, designate the method by which the contributions shall be calculated, collected and distributed. The commission shall authorize a monthly charge to customers, in the amount specified by the commission, to recover each contributor's required payment to the universal service fund. Any charge related to mobile telecommunications service shall only apply if the customer's place of primary use is in this state as provided by the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C. ยง ยง 116 to 126. The provisions of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act shall apply to this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commission shall administer the monies in the universal service fund to assist only those customers of telecommunications companies located in areas of this state with relatively high rates for noncompetitive essential local exchange services. Services deemed competitive under W.S. 37-15-202(a), (c) or (d) shall not be eligible for universal service fund support under this article. The commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall determine a reasonable amount and a fair method of distributing monies. The commission may authorize a credit to customer bills, in the amount specified by the commission, to reflect distributions received by the local exchange company from the universal service fund.</p>
                  <p>The commission shall ensure that the method shall promote the emergence of competition in providing local exchange service.</p>
                  <p>(d) In accordance with the method of distribution determined by the commission, a telecommunications company shall, unless it elects to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to the method set forth in subsection (g) of this section, receive funds under this section to the extent that its noncompetitive essential local exchange service prices, after consideration of any contributions from the federal universal service fund, exceed the price benchmark established in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) The following limitations shall be applied to operation of the universal service fund:</p>
                  <p>(i) The operation of the universal service fund may be suspended by the commission, based upon a public interest finding, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that the fund is not then serving its intended purpose;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the event that distributions made pursuant to subsection (g) of this section cause total distributions from the universal service fund in any fiscal year to exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the amount distributed in fiscal year 2013-2014, the commission shall reduce payments among those electing distributions under subsection (g) of this section, pro rata, so as to reduce the total distribution to one hundred twenty-five (125%) of the fiscal year 2013-2014 distribution amount.</p>
                  <p>(f) The commission's decisions under this section shall be subject to the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(g) A telecommunications company that undertakes the requirements set forth in this subsection may make a one-time, irrevocable before July 1, 2023, election in writing to the commission to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to this subsection rather than pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. In order to receive funds pursuant to this subsection, the company shall provide essential local exchange service, or its functional equivalent, upon reasonable request throughout the local exchange area of a rural incumbent local exchange carrier, as defined by the federal communications commission on January 1, 2015, at a price not exceeding the price benchmark established in subsection (h) of this section. A telecommunications company which elects to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to this subsection shall receive funds to the extent that its loop costs, as reflected in the company's most recent annual filing of unseparated loop costs filed with the Universal Service Administration Company, exceed the company's most recent annual federal universal service funds receipts and annual local revenues. In calculating annual local revenues the commission shall utilize the imputed price benchmark established in subsection (h) of this section. If an otherwise qualified company elects to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to this subsection, but does not file an annual unseparated loop cost report with the Universal Service Administration Company, it shall file the equivalent information with the commission.</p>
                  <p>(h) The price benchmark shall be thirty dollars ($30.00) until July 1, 2023 unless otherwise adjusted by the commission pursuant to this subsection. On and after July 1, 2019, the commission shall review the price benchmark one (1) time every four (4) years and, after review, shall adjust the benchmark as necessary to assure that it approximates one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the weighted statewide average essential local exchange service price. The commission may change the price benchmark at any time if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commission determines that the price benchmark does not approximate one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the weighted statewide average essential local exchange service price and that the price benchmark should be adjusted by ten percent (10%) or more.</p>

                  <p>(a) Telecommunications companies which use cellular, radio spectrum or other wireless technology to provide supported services to customers who are otherwise eligible to receive universal service support pursuant to W.S. 37-15-501, may establish eligibility to receive universal service fund distributions in an amount to be determined by the commission, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The telecommunications company will offer and advertise all universal service fund supported services throughout the entire local exchange area;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The telecommunications company will provide unlimited local calling throughout an entire local exchange area for a flat fee;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The telecommunications company's bill to the customer reflects a credit for the amount of distribution the company receives from the state universal service fund for providing universal service fund supported services to that customer; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The company and services meet such additional criteria, if any, the commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines are necessary. During its consideration and determination, the commission shall consider technological and competitive neutrality.</p>

On request by a member owner, for the exclusive purpose of preparing a complaint pursuant to this subsection, and in compliance with the cooperative's by- laws, the cooperative electric utility shall provide a list to the member owner which includes the names and contact information of all member owners included in the rate class of the requesting member owner.</p>
                <p>(c) All retail rates adopted in accordance with this article shall be filed with the commission.</p>
                <p>(d) If within two (2) months of final implementation of a retail rate a complaint signed by not less than five percent (5%) of the member owners in any rate class, is filed with the cooperative electric utility's board of directors, the board shall have two (2) months from the date of filing to attempt to resolve the complaint. The complaint may be filed with the commission after the expiration of this two (2) month period.</p>
                <p>(e) Upon filing of the complaint with the commission, the commission shall investigate the rate adjustment. A complaint filed with the commission shall be resolved pursuant to commission hearing and enforcement procedures. The commission is authorized to require the utility to revise its rates if the commission finds, after investigation, that the rates are inadequate or unremunerative, or unjust, or unreasonable, or unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential or otherwise in any respect in violation of any provision of this article. The commission may order the revised rates to include provisions for refunds. The revised rates of the utility shall remain in effect while the rates are under appeal pending commission order.</p>
                <p>(f) Any cooperative exempted under W.S. 37-17-103 shall apply energy retail rates equally to all member owners in the same rate class. In the event a cooperative does not apply energy retail rates equally, regardless of state boundaries, the cooperative will immediately be subject to rate regulation by the Wyoming public service commission.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>37-18-102. Energy generation portfolio standards; reporting requirements; rate recovery and limitations.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Consistent with the objective of ensuring Wyoming electric utilities maintain access to reliable and cost effective electric generation resources, the public service commission shall establish by rule energy portfolio standards that will maximize the use of dispatchable and reliable low- carbon electricity. In establishing standards, the commission:</p>
                <p>(i) Shall require a public utility to generate a specified percentage of electricity generated to be dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity;</p>
                <p>(ii) Shall establish a date not later than July 1, 2030 for requiring a percentage of electricity generated by a public utility to be dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity taking into consideration any potentially expiring federal tax credits;</p>
                <p>(iii) Shall establish intermediate standards and requirements for dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity that public utilities must generate before the electricity generation standard established in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection;</p>
                <p>(iv) Shall require each public utility to demonstrate in each integrated resource plan submitted to the commission the steps the public utility is taking to achieve the electricity generation standard established in paragraphs (i) through (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                <p>(v) Shall for each public utility:</p>
                <p>(A) Establish baseline standards for electric reliability to ensure that new or expanded intermittent generation resources do not unreasonably diminish power quality or increase momentary outages across a utility's service territory or in any particular location;</p>
                <p>(B) Require the utility to monitor and report electric reliability and power quality outcomes in integrated resource plan submissions or as otherwise directed by the commission; and</p>
                <p>(C) Require the utility to take any steps the commission deems reasonably necessary to maintain reasonable levels of electric reliability and power quality.</p>
                <p>(b) In addition to W.S. 37-3-117(a), the rates charged by an electric public utility shall not include any recovery of or earnings on the capital costs associated with new electric generation facilities built, in whole or in part, to replace the electricity generated from one (1) or more coal fired electric generation facilities located in Wyoming and retired on or after January 1, 2024, unless the commission determines that the public utility that owned the retired coal fired electric generation facility:</p>
                <p>(i) Has satisfied the requirements of W.S. 37-3- 117(a); and</p>
                <p>(ii) Is achieving or has taken steps to the commission's satisfaction to achieve the electricity generation standards established under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(c) Subject to W.S. 37-3-117(a) and the limitation in subsection (b) of this section, the commission shall consider the following when establishing reasonable rates for a public utility working toward and achieving the electricity generation standards established under subsection (a) of this section:</p>
                <p>(i) A public utility that generates dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity may apply to the commission for rate recovery of the cost of any carbon capture, utilization and storage technology used to achieve the electricity generation standards established under subsection (a) of this section, including a higher return on equity, provided that the carbon capture, utilization and storage technology is integral or adjacent to a coal fired generation facility in Wyoming;</p>
                <p>(ii) A public utility may apply to the commission for authorization to allow a portion of any revenues from the sale of carbon dioxide captured, stored or utilized as a result of generating dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity to be returned to the shareholders of the public utility;</p>
                <p>(iii) To the extent a public utility can demonstrate that it will incur incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard, the commission shall authorize the public utility to implement a rate recovery mechanism that collects a surcharge from customers not to exceed two percent (2%) of each customer's total electric bill to provide for the recovery of the prudently incurred incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard. A rate recovery mechanism may be authorized and established prior to the public utility incurring incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard and the public utility may retain funds collected through a mechanism in a regulatory account approved by the commission to offset future costs. To the extent the rate recovery mechanism is insufficient to compensate the public utility for its prudently incurred incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard, the commission shall take such actions as necessary notwithstanding any other provision of this section to ensure the public utility is able to recover its prudently incurred incremental costs and customers are not charged for those incremental costs other than through the rate recovery mechanism.</p>
                <p>(d) The commission shall promulgate rules to ensure that public utilities are satisfactorily progressing toward achieving the dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity generation standard that the commission establishes as required in subsection (a) of this section and achieving reasonable electric reliability and power quality outcomes as required by subsection</p>
                <p>(a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(e) Beginning in 2023, and occurring every second year thereafter, the commission shall report to the legislature regarding whether implementation of the electricity portfolio standards is meeting the legislative declaration and findings and recommend whether it should be continued, modified or repealed. To the extent the electricity portfolio standards is modified or discontinued, nothing shall impair the ability of a public utility that has incurred costs to comply with the electricity portfolio standard to recover its prudently incurred costs as authorized by the commission.</p>
