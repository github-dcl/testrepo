                  <p>Upon filing with the state banking commissioner the articles of incorporation as required by W.S. 13-2-201 and 13-2-202, an application and any other information required by the rules and regulations of the board, the state banking commissioner shall notify the applicants in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of any deficiency in the required information or that the application has been accepted for filing. When the state banking commissioner is satisfied that all required information has been furnished, he shall notify the chairman of the board who shall establish a time and place within the county of the proposed financial institution location for a public hearing which shall be not less than sixty (60) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days after notice from the state banking commissioner that the application is in order. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the time and place of the public hearing, the applicant shall cause notice of filing of the application and of the hearing to be published at applicant's expense in a newspaper of general circulation within the county where the proposed financial institution is to be located. Publication shall be made at least once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks before the hearing stating the proposed location of the financial institution, the names of the proposed applicants for a charter, the nature of the activities to be conducted by the proposed institution and other information as the board shall prescribe from time to time by rules and regulations. The applicant shall furnish proof of publication to the state banking commissioner not more than ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The state banking commissioner shall send notice of the hearing to state and national banks, federal savings and loan associations and other financial institutions in the state who have requested notice from the state banking commissioner and to the appropriate federal financial institution regulatory authorities.</p>

                  <p>The application filed with the state banking commissioner shall be accompanied by a fee established by rule and regulation of the state banking commissioner to cover the expense of the investigation by the state banking commissioner, the expense of the public hearing and other related expenses. The fee shall be deposited by the state banking commissioner with the state treasurer into the financial institutions administration account. Expenditures shall be made from the account by warrants drawn by the state auditor, upon vouchers issued and signed by the director or commissioner. Funds from the account shall be expended only to carry out the duties of the commissioner and the state banking board under this article and for chartering trust companies under chapter 5 of this title. If an application for a financial institution charter is withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to the hearing on the application, the statutory application filing fee, less the amount of any expense authorized above and actually incurred, shall be refunded to the applicant. If the application expenses are less than the application fee collected the unexpended amount shall remain within the account.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon receiving the articles of incorporation, application and other information required, the state banking commissioner shall make a careful investigation and examination of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The character, reputation, financial standing and ability of the organizers;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The character, financial responsibility, banking or savings and loan or other financial experience and business qualifications of those proposed as officers;</p>

                  <p>(iv) The need in the community where the institution would be located giving particular consideration to the adequacy of existing financial facilities and the effect that the proposed institution would have upon existing financial institutions in the community;</p>
                  <p>(v) The ability of the community to support the proposed institution, including existing competition, the economic history of the community and the opportunity for profitable employment of financial institution funds; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) Such other facts and circumstances bearing on the proposed financial institution as the banking commissioner may deem relevant.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state banking commissioner shall submit his findings verbally and in writing at the public hearing on the application and shall be subject to cross-examination by any interested party. No relevant information shall be excluded by the board as hearsay.</p>

                  <p>(a) Within ninety (90) days after receipt of the transcript of the public hearing, the board shall in its discretion approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application, but it shall not approve the application until it has ascertained to its satisfaction:</p>
                  <p>(i) The public need and convenience will be promoted by the establishment of the proposed financial institution;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Conditions in the community in which the proposed financial institution would transact business afford reasonable promise of successful operation;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The financial institution is being formed for no other purpose than the legitimate objects contemplated by the laws of the state;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The proposed capital and surplus are not less than the required minimum and are adequate in light of current and prospective conditions;</p>
                  <p>(v) The proposed officers and directors have sufficient experience, ability and standing to afford reasonable promise of successful operation;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The name of the proposed financial institution does not resemble so closely as to cause confusion the name of any other financial institution transacting business in the county; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) The applicants have complied with all applicable provisions of law.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board shall take action upon the application by stating its findings of fact and conclusions of law. If the board approves the application, the state banking commissioner shall endorse upon the articles of incorporation the approval and shall file one (1) copy with the secretary of state, retain one (1) copy in his files and return one (1) copy to the applicants within twenty (20) days after the date of the decision of the board approving the application. If the board conditionally approves an application by requiring increased capital or surplus, retention of additional qualified officers or directors, or change of name to avoid confusion, and upon compliance by the applicant, the state banking commissioner shall proceed as provided in the preceding sentence. If the board disapproves the application, the state banking commissioner shall mail notice of the disapproval to the applicants within twenty (20) days after the board's negative action.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board may waive the public hearing required under W.S. 13-2-207 if the application is for an interim bank charter to be used as a vehicle for merger with an existing bank which is currently serving the public need and convenience of the community, operating profitably, adequately capitalized, has officers and directors of proven ability and is to be chartered solely for the purpose of facilitating the merger and the change in ownership of the existing bank in accordance with W.S. 13-4-108. The application fee for an interim bank charter for which a public hearing is waived shall be established by rule and regulation of the commissioner. The fee shall be deposited by the state banking commissioner with the state treasurer and credited to the financial institutions administration account. Expenditures shall be made from the account by warrants drawn by the state auditor, upon vouchers issued and signed by the director or commissioner. Funds from the account shall be expended only to carry out the duties of the commissioner or the state banking board.</p>

                  <p>If the application is approved and a charter granted by the board, the financial institution shall not commence business before receiving a certificate of authority to operate from the state banking commissioner. The application for a certificate of authority shall be made to the state banking commissioner and shall certify that the capital and surplus have been paid in, the address at which the institution will operate and that all of the bylaws adopted have been attached as an exhibit to the application. The application shall state who the officers, directors and stockholders are at that time and have attached evidence that appropriate federal insurance of deposits has been obtained, where applicable. The state banking commissioner shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days after the application has been filed, but the authority of the state banking commissioner to disapprove any application is restricted solely to noncompliance with this section. If the state banking commissioner approves the application, he shall issue a certificate of authority to the organizers within twenty (20) days. If the state banking commissioner denies the application, he shall mail a notice of denial to the organizers within twenty (20) days, stating the reasons for denying the application, and grant to the organizers a maximum period of ninety (90) days to resubmit the application with the necessary corrections. If the applicant fails to comply with requirements of the notice of denial within ninety (90) days from the receipt of the notice, the approval of the application and articles of incorporation previously issued to the applying institution shall be revoked by the state banking commissioner. The failure of the state banking commissioner to act upon an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days shall be deemed an approval. If the approved institution fails to commence business in good faith within one (1) year after the issuance of a certificate of authority by the state banking commissioner or any required federal approval, whichever is later, the charter and certificate of authority shall expire.</p>

                  <p>The commissioner may take joint enforcement actions with any other bank supervisory agency having concurrent jurisdiction over any branch in Wyoming of an out-of-state bank or any branch of a Wyoming state bank in any host state or may take such action independently if the commissioner deems the actions to be necessary or appropriate to carry out his responsibilities under this article or to ensure compliance with the laws of this state. In the case of an out-of-state state bank, the commissioner shall recognize the exclusive authority of the home state supervisor over corporate governance matters and the primary responsibility of the home state supervisor with respect to safety and soundness matters. If the commissioner determines that a branch maintained by an out-of-state state bank in this state, or a branch of a Wyoming bank operating in another state, is being operated in violation of any provision of the laws of this state, or that the branch is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner, the commissioner shall have the authority to take all the enforcement actions as he would be empowered to take if the branch were a Wyoming state bank; provided, that the commissioner shall promptly give notice to the home state supervisor or host state supervisor, as applicable, of each enforcement action taken against an out-of-state bank and, to the extent practicable, shall consult and cooperate with the home state supervisor in pursuing and resolving the enforcement action.</p>

                  <p>(a) With prior written approval of the commissioner, a bank may purchase for its own account the stock in a corporation to perform functions that are authorized for the bank or that are usual or incidental to the business of banking, subject to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) The bank shall own or control eighty percent (80%) or more of the voting stock of the subsidiary corporation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) No officer, director or shareholder of the bank or any person in a substantially similar controlling or governing position of its bank holding company shall otherwise have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the subsidiary corporation;</p>

                  <p>(v) Each subsidiary shall be subject to examination and supervision by the commissioner in the same manner and to the same extent as the bank. If the commissioner determines the subsidiary is violating any applicable law or that operation of the subsidiary is adversely affecting the safety and soundness of the bank, the commissioner may order the bank to dispose of all or any part of the subsidiary upon such terms as the commissioner deems appropriate or take any other appropriate administrative action authorized in this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The bank shall file an application for permission to operate a subsidiary with the commissioner, together with an application fee established by rule and regulation of the commissioner.

                  <p>(iii) A description of the nature of the bank’s investment in the subsidiary.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner shall approve the application and issue a certificate of authority to operate the subsidiary to the bank within twenty (20) days after receipt of the completed application and fee unless the commissioner finds:</p>
                  <p>(i) The proposed activity or activities to be performed at the subsidiary are not activities the bank is authorized to perform and are not activities that are usual or incidental to the business of banking; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Operation of the subsidiary will adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank.</p>
                  <p>(d) With the prior approval of the commissioner, an approved subsidiary of a bank may engage in a new activity. The bank shall file a written application for approval of the new activity with the commissioner in the form prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall approve the application in writing no later than twenty (20) days after receipt of the application if the commissioner finds that the proposed new activity is an activity that is authorized for the bank or is usual or incidental to the business of the bank and the proposed new activity will not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a bank from establishing and operating a subsidiary in a state other than Wyoming, provided that the bank complies with all applicable provisions of Wyoming law, the law of the state where the subsidiary will be located and federal law.</p>

                  <p>(a) The board of directors may, quarterly, semiannually or annually, declare a dividend of so much of the net profits of the bank as they judge proper, except that no dividends shall be declared until the surplus fund of the bank equals its common capital unless there has been carried to the surplus fund not less than ten percent (10%) of the bank's net profits of the preceding six (6) consecutive months in the case of quarterly or semiannual dividends, or not less than ten percent (10%) of its net profits of the preceding twelve (12) consecutive months in the case of annual dividends. For the purposes of this section, any amounts paid into a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock of any bank out of its net profits for such period are deemed to be additions to its surplus fund if, upon retirement of the preferred stock, the amounts paid into the retirement fund may then properly be carried to surplus. In such case, the bank is obligated to transfer to surplus the amounts paid into the retirement fund on account of the preferred stock as the stock is retired.</p>
                  <p>(b) The approval of the state banking commissioner is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year shall exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two (2) years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock.</p>
                  <p>(c) For the purpose of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Net profits" means the net income or loss reported by a bank in its report of condition and income;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Retained net profits" for any period shall be equal to the net income or loss reported in the report of condition and income less any common or preferred stock dividends declared or otherwise charged to the undivided profits of the period for which the retained net profits are computed.</p>
                  <p>(d) No dividend shall be declared by the board of directors of any bank which is operating under any form of regulatory action without prior written approval of the state banking commissioner.</p>

The state banking commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall visit and examine each bank as often as the commissioner deems necessary and at least as frequently as required by the federal deposit insurance corporation, with or without previous notice to the officers of or anyone interested in the bank. The state banking commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall make a complete and careful examination of the condition and resources of the bank, the mode of managing bank affairs and conducting its business, the action of bank officers and directors in the investment and disposition of bank funds, the safety and prudence of bank management, the security afforded to those by whom bank engagements are held, whether the requirements of this act are being complied with and such other matters as the state banking commissioner may prescribe. If the state banking commissioner examines a bank more than twice in any calendar year, the bank shall pay to the state banking commissioner an additional fee established by rule and regulation of the commissioner.</p>

The supervisory fees are to provide for the general administration and operating costs of the office of the state banking commissioner for the administration of the laws and regulations governing the banking industry generally. Such fees shall be established by regulation of the state banking commissioner and shall be adjusted by regulations issued by the state banking commissioner to assure consistency with the cost of supervision and the fees paid by national banks. Other fees assessed for administrative services caused by applications or activities attributable to a specific financial institution or entity, shall be used to defray the cost of the special services and, to the extent possible, shall be recovered from the financial institution or entity which requires the special service.</p>

The value of the shares shall be determined, as of the date of the stockholders' meeting approving the merger or conversion, by three (3) appraisers, one (1) to be selected by the owners of two-thirds (2/3) of the dissenting shares involved, one (1) by the board of directors of the resulting state or national bank, and the third by the two (2) so chosen. The valuation agreed upon by any two (2) appraisers shall govern.

                  <p>(a) If the state banking commissioner has reason to believe that the capital of any bank is impaired he shall examine the bank and ascertain the facts. If he finds an impairment of capital, he shall provide written notice to each director of the bank and require the bank to restore the deficiency within sixty (60) days after the date of the notice. Written notice under this section may be provided by electronic transmission, consistent with W.S. 17-16-141(c).</p>
                  <p>(b) After the directors of a bank have received written notice to restore a deficiency under subsection (a) of this section, the directors shall, within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice, levy an assessment upon the common stock of the bank to repair the deficiency. Written notice of the deficiency and the amount of the assessment shall be provided to each shareholder, and may be provided by electronic transmission, consistent with W.S. 17-16-141(c). If any shareholder fails to pay the assessment within thirty (30) days of receiving notice, the directors of the bank may sell the stock of the shareholder to the highest bidder at public auction. Notice of the sale shall be published for ten (10) days in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the bank is located and a copy of the notice of sale shall be served on the owner of the stock personally or by mail at his last known address ten (10) days before the day of sale. The stock may be sold at private sale without public notice. Before a private sale an offer in writing shall first be obtained and a copy of the offer served upon the owner of record of the stock either personally or by mailing a copy of the offer to his last known address. If, after service of the offer, the owner still fails to pay the assessment within two (2) weeks from the time of the service of the offer, the directors may accept the private offer or a larger offer. The stock shall not be sold for less than the amount of the assessment and cost of sale. Out of the proceeds of the sale the directors shall pay the assessment and the cost of sale and the balance shall be paid to the person whose stock has been sold. A sale of stock cancels the outstanding certificate evidencing the stock sold. A new certificate shall be issued by the bank to the purchaser.</p>

                  <p>(f) No corporation or the registrar or transfer agent thereof shall be liable for registering or causing to be registered on the books of the corporation any securities in the name of any nominee of a supervised trust company or for transferring or causing to be transferred on the books of the corporation any securities theretofore registered by the corporation in the name of any nominee of a supervised trust company, as provided in this section, when the transfer is made on the authorization of the nominee.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to other powers conferred by this chapter, the commissioner shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Supervise and examine all supervised trust companies organized under the provisions of this chapter and all supervised trust companies shall be subject to the laws of this state governing banks and other financial institutions in all cases where the laws do not conflict with the provisions of this chapter. The commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall visit and examine each supervised trust company pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. All supervised trust companies shall file with the commissioner an annual report of the supervised trust company's assets in a form prescribed by the commissioner and other reports as required by the commissioner;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the exercise of the power to make orders and regulations to implement the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner shall act in the interests of promoting and maintaining a sound trust company system, the security of assets and trust accounts, and the protection of other customers;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Collect from each supervised trust company an amount equal to the total cost of examinations conducted under the authority of this section. The fees and expenses collected shall be remitted to the state treasurer and deposited as provided in subsection (b) of this section and may be expended as provided in that subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iv) On or before January 31 of each year, each supervised trust company shall compute and pay supervisory fees to the commissioner as set forth in the rules and regulations of the commissioner. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the supervisory fees shall provide for the general administration of the laws and regulations governing the supervised trust company industry. The fees shall be established by regulation of the commissioner and shall be adjusted by regulations issued by the commissioner to assure consistency with the cost of supervision. Other fees assessed for administrative services related to activities attributable to a specific supervised trust company shall be used to pay the costs of special services rendered by or at the direction of the commissioner and shall be recovered from the supervised trust company which required the special services.</p>
                  <p>(b) A trust company resolution fund account is established. A portion of each supervisory fee paid pursuant to paragraph (a)(iv) of this section shall be paid to the resolution fund account and shall be used by the commissioner in the event of an involuntary dissolution of a supervised trust company. The amount paid to the resolution fund account shall be established by regulation of the commissioner. All amounts paid shall be remitted to the state treasurer and deposited and credited to the trust company resolution fund account. Expenditures from the account shall be made using warrants drawn by the state auditor, upon vouchers issued and signed by the director of the department of audit or commissioner. Funds from the account shall be expended only to carry out the duties of the commissioner in the involuntary dissolution of a supervised trust company.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any supervised trust company shall, before transacting any business, pledge or furnish a surety bond to the commissioner to cover costs likely to be incurred by the commissioner in a receivership or liquidation of the supervised trust company should it become unsafe or unsound pursuant to W.S. 13-5-417. The amount of the pledge or the surety bond shall be determined by the commissioner in an amount sufficient to defray the costs of a receivership or liquidation, but shall have a market value of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). In lieu of a bond, the supervised trust company may irrevocably pledge its capital account to the commissioner. Any investments pledged to the commissioner shall be held in a state or nationally chartered bank or savings and loan association having a principal or branch office in this state and all costs associated with pledging and holding such investments are the responsibility of the supervised trust company.</p>
                  <p>(b) Investments pledged to the commissioner shall be of the same nature and quality as those required for state financial institutions in W.S. 9-4-805.</p>
                  <p>(c) Surety bonds shall run to the state of Wyoming, and shall be approved under the terms and conditions required by W.S. 9-4-804(b) and (c).</p>
                  <p>(d) The commissioner may promulgate rules pursuant to W.S. 13-1-603 to establish additional investment guidelines or investment options for purposes of the pledge or surety bond required by this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) In the event of a receivership of a supervised trust company as provided in W.S. 13-5-417, the commissioner may, without regard to priorities, preferences or adverse claims, reduce the pledged investments to cash as soon as practicable with court approval, and utilize the cash to defray the costs associated with the receivership.</p>
                  <p>(f) Income from investments pledged under this section shall be paid to the supervised trust company unless the court places the supervised trust company in receivership.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon evidence that the current bond or investment pledge is insufficient, the commissioner may require any supervised trust company to increase its investment pledge or surety by providing no less than thirty (30) days written notice to the supervised trust company. The supervised trust company to which notice is given may request a hearing in writing no more than thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the proposed increase. Any hearing before the commissioner shall be held pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>13-5-419. Voluntary dissolution of supervised trust company; liquidation; reorganization; application for dissolution; filing fee; filing with secretary of state; revocation of charter.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A supervised trust company may voluntarily dissolve in the manner provided herein. Voluntary dissolution shall be accomplished by either liquidating the supervised trust company or reorganizing the supervised trust company into a domestic or foreign corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability partnership that does not engage in trust company business. Upon complete liquidation or completion of the reorganization, the commissioner shall revoke the supervised trust company's charter and thereafter the company may not use the word "trust" in its business name or in connection with its business and may not conduct trust company business.</p>
                  <p>(b) A supervised trust company seeking to dissolve its charter either by liquidation or reorganization shall file an application for dissolution with the commissioner accompanied by a filing fee established by rule and regulation of the commissioner. The application shall include a comprehensive plan for dissolution setting forth the proposed disposition of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect a liquidation or reorganization. The plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge or assumption of all of the supervised trust company's known and unknown claims and liabilities and for the transfer of all of its responsibilities as a trustee to a successor trustee or trustees. Additionally, the application for dissolution shall include other evidence, certifications, affidavits, documents or information as the commissioner may require demonstrating how assets and liabilities will be disposed, the timetable for effecting disposition of the assets and liabilities and the applicant's proposal for addressing any claims that are asserted after the dissolution has been completed. The commissioner shall examine the application for completeness and compliance with the requirements of this section, the business entity laws applicable to the required type of dissolution and applicable rules and regulations. The commissioner may conduct a special examination of the applicant for purposes of evaluating the application.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the commissioner finds that the application is incomplete, the commissioner shall return it for completion not later than sixty (60) days after it is filed. If the application is found to be complete by the commissioner, not later than thirty (30) days after it is filed, the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the application. If the commissioner approves the application, the applicant may proceed with the dissolution pursuant to the plan outlined in the application, subject to any conditions the commissioner may prescribe. If the applicant subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution needs to be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the commissioner and obtain approval to proceed under the amended plan. If the commissioner does not approve the application or amended plan, the applicant may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and satisfaction of all conditions prescribed by the commissioner, the applicant shall submit a written report of its actions to the commissioner. The report shall contain a certification made under oath that the report is true and correct. Following receipt of the report, the commissioner, no later than sixty (60) days after the filing of the report, shall examine the supervised trust company to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the commissioner. If all requirements and conditions have been met, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that the dissolution has been completed and issue a certificate of dissolution. Upon receiving a certificate of dissolution, the applicant shall surrender its charter to the commissioner. The applicant shall then file articles of dissolution and other documents required by W.S. 17-16-1401 through 17-16-1440 for a corporation or required by W.S. 17-29- 701 through 17-29-708 for a limited liability company, in the office of the secretary of state. In the case of reorganization, the applicant shall also file the documents required by the secretary of state to finalize the reorganization.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the commissioner is not satisfied that all required actions under the plan for dissolution or as required by the commissioner have been taken, the commissioner shall notify the applicant not later than thirty (30) days after the examination pursuant to subsection (d) of this section in writing what additional actions shall be taken to be eligible for a certificate of dissolution. The commissioner shall establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence that the additional actions have been taken. The commissioner may extend the deadline for good cause shown. If the applicant fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that its voluntary dissolution is not approved, and the applicant may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(f) The commissioner may adopt rules pursuant to W.S. 13- 1-603 to carry out the requirements of this section.</p>

                  <p>(c) The board may waive the public meeting or hearing required under W.S. 13-5-502(b) if the application is for an interim public trust company charter to be used as a vehicle for merger with an existing public trust company that is currently serving the public need and convenience of the community, operating profitably, adequately capitalized, has officers and directors or managers of proven ability and is to be chartered solely for the purpose of facilitating the merger and the change in ownership of the existing public trust company. The application fee for an interim public trust company charter for which a public meeting or hearing is waived shall be established by rule and regulation of the commissioner.

                  <p>If the application is approved and a charter granted by the board, the public trust company shall not commence business before receiving a certificate of authority to operate from the commissioner. An application for a certificate of authority shall be made to the commissioner and shall certify that all required capital and surplus have been paid in. The application shall list the address at which the public trust company will operate and shall attach the organizational instrument or all adopted bylaws. The application shall state who the officers, directors and stockholders or the members and managers are at that time. The commissioner shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days after the application has been filed, but the authority of the commissioner to disapprove any application is restricted solely to noncompliance with this section. If the commissioner approves the application, he shall issue a certificate of authority to the organizers within twenty (20) days. If the commissioner denies the application, he shall mail a notice of denial to the organizers within twenty (20) days, stating the reasons for denying the application, and grant to the organizers a maximum period of ninety (90) days to resubmit the application with the necessary corrections. If the applicant fails to comply with requirements of the notice of denial within ninety (90) days from the receipt of the notice, the approval of the application and charter previously issued to the applying public trust company shall be revoked by the commissioner. The failure of the commissioner to act upon an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days shall be deemed an approval.</p>
                  <p>If the approved public trust company fails to commence business in good faith within one (1) year after the issuance of a certificate of authority by the commissioner or any required federal approval, whichever is later, the charter and certificate of authority shall expire.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any association organized under the laws of this state, including a mutual savings and loan association, may reorganize the association and provide for the carrying on of its business under the laws of this state by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the shares of the members of the association who vote at the meeting. No meeting shall be called unless the plan has first been approved by the state banking commissioner, the federal deposit insurance corporation and the comptroller of the currency. Notice of the meeting shall contain a statement of the time, place and purpose of the meeting and an outline of the reorganization plan. Notice shall be given by mailing a copy to each shareholder at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the meeting, addressed to the shareholder at his address shown by the books of the association. Shareholders may vote at the meeting in person or by proxy and all voting shall be by ballot. The plan of reorganization may provide for reincorporation under the existing corporate name or under a different name, may provide for the exchange of shares in the association for shares of the same or a different class in the reorganized association and may fix the time or times prior to which notice of withdrawal of shares issued in exchange for shares in the association being reorganized shall not be given, and, if the withdrawal of the shares is so postponed, this fact shall be printed or stamped on the face of the certificates evidencing shares so to be issued. All obligations to any prior association shall inure to the benefit of the reorganized association and be enforceable by it and in its name, and demands, claims and rights of action against any prior association may be enforced against the reorganized association as fully and completely as they might have been enforced before reorganization.</p>
                  <p>(b) Associations that are in the course of liquidation may reorganize. No reorganization is effective until approved by the state banking commissioner and the appropriate federal banking regulatory agency and until the members holding three-fourths (3/4) of the outstanding shares have approved the plan in writing.</p>
                  <p>(c) A copy of the articles of incorporation of the association as reorganized, certified by the secretary of the association, shall be filed with the state banking commissioner in the same manner provided for amendments to articles of incorporation. All pending withdrawal applications shall be cancelled.</p>

                  <p>(i) At any meeting of the shareholders of the association called to consider a conversion and held in accordance with the laws governing the association, the shareholders by an affirmative vote of the majority of the shareholders present in person or by proxy may vote to convert the association into a federal savings and loan association;</p>

                  <p>(iii) After the adjournment of the meeting of shareholders, the association shall take the necessary action to make it a federal savings and loan association.

At this meeting directors of the converted association shall be chosen, and either the meeting shall adopt or the directors chosen shall adopt bylaws for the converted association;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A copy of the minutes of the meeting of the shareholders and members, verified by the affidavit of the president or vice president and the secretary of the meeting, shall be filed within ten (10) days after the meeting with the appropriate federal banking regulatory agency and in the state banking commissioner's office. The verified copy of the minutes of the meeting, when filed, is presumptive evidence of the holding and the action of the meeting;</p>

                  <p>(a) The association may redeem by lot or otherwise, as determined by the board of directors, any part of any of its savings or investment accounts on a dividend date by giving thirty (30) days' notice by registered mail when funds are available for that purpose. An association shall not redeem any of its accounts when the association is in an impaired condition or when it has applications for withdrawal which have been on file more than thirty (30) days and have not been reached for payment. The redemption price of accounts redeemed shall be the full value of the account redeemed, as determined by the board of directors, but in no event shall the redemption price be less than the withdrawal value. If the notice of redemption has been duly given, and if on or before the redemption date the funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside to be available for the redemption, dividends upon the accounts called for redemption shall cease to accrue from and after the dividend date specified as the redemption date and all rights with respect to accounts shall terminate immediately after the redemption date, except only the right of the account holder of record to receive the redemption price without interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) All account books or certificates evidencing accounts which have been validly called for redemption must be tendered for payment within ten (10) years from the date of redemption designated in the redemption notice otherwise they shall be cancelled and all claims of the account holders against the association are barred.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in W.S. 13-7-102, any savings and loan association may issue its debenture bonds maturing not later than five (5) years from the date of issue and bearing interest not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum. No bonds shall be issued unless there are sufficient funds on hand or receivable in time to meet approved applications for loans or for the payment of withdrawals of accounts. Debenture bonds may be retired by action of the board of directors at any time after one (1) year from date of issue by the secretary of the association giving notice in writing sixty (60) days or more prior to the next interest date to the recorded holders of the bonds. On return of the retired bonds together with any coupons, holders shall receive the par value of the bonds. At the expiration of the next interest period the bonds called shall cease to draw interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) Whenever the state banking commissioner deems any indebtedness incurred under the provisions of this section to be detrimental to the interest of the association, he shall notify the association to reduce its indebtedness to an amount he considers reasonable, giving the association reasonable time to effect the reduction of indebtedness.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any state savings and loan association may borrow money from the federal home loan bank, when authorized by resolution of its board of directors, upon terms and rates of interest as may be agreed upon. It may assign and pledge its notes, bonds, mortgages or other property and repledge the shares of stock or savings certificates pledged to it as collateral security without securing the consent of the owner as security for the repayment of its indebtedness. Any lawful holder of any evidence of indebtedness due to an association may enforce, in his own name or in the name of the association, all appropriate remedies to enforce collection, whether or not the stock or savings certificate described in connection with the note is held by the pledgee or holder.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any obligation incurred or loan made by an association constitutes a claim against the corporate assets and is payable in advance of, and by preference over, all claims or rights of the shareholders or holders of savings certificates in any of the assets of the association. These obligations are senior to any demand for the withdrawal or cancellation of all classes of shares or savings certificates in the association including matured shares or savings certificates.</p>
                  <p>(c) The existence of a withdrawal list consisting of members desiring to withdraw from the association does not prevent the board of directors of the association from borrowing money from the federal home loan bank to be used solely for the purpose of making mortgage loans to the members of the association, but all borrowed money shall be exclusively used for the purpose borrowed. A savings and loan association shall not at any time borrow money from the federal home loan bank in an amount exceeding any limit fixed by the laws of this state.</p>

A complete abstract of title for the real estate signed by the person or corporation furnishing the abstract which shall be examined by a competent attorney-at-law and his opinion furnished approving the title and showing that the mortgage is a first lien, or a policy of title insurance of a reliable title insurance company authorized to issue insurance on titles within this state, or a duplicate certificate of ownership issued by a registrar of titles, shall be furnished. No mortgage loan shall be made except upon the report in writing of an appraiser or a committee of appraisers appointed by the board of directors which shall state the conservative value of the mortgage security. The directors may also loan upon the security of savings on deposit in the association to the amount of ninety percent (90%) of their withdrawal value, and may loan upon or invest in bonds of the United States and the state of Wyoming, in real property loans insured by the federal housing administration or guaranteed by the veterans administration, and in classes of bonds and warrants of the counties, school districts and other municipalities, as well as local improvement districts in this state, as the state banking commissioner may from time to time approve but no association shall loan any of its funds to an officer or director of the association.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the laws of the state, under which any foreign association is organized, require annual examinations of the association and are made pursuant to that law, then the foreign association need not be examined under this section but the foreign association shall annually furnish the state banking commissioner a certificate of the proper officer of the other state that he has made an examination pursuant to the laws of that state and that the affairs of the association are in accord with the laws of that state. The state banking commissioner may, however, when he deems it advisable, cause an examination of the foreign association to be made as is required of domestic associations.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the state banking commissioner has good reason to doubt the solvency of any foreign association doing business in this state and if he is not fully satisfied with the certificate of the president and secretary or other officer, he shall proceed to make an examination of the association.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the state banking commissioner finds that the foreign association has made fraudulent or untrue statements or that it is conducting its business in an irregular manner, or if he believes that an association in this state is conducting its business fraudulently or is not in good faith carrying out its contracts with its members or stockholders in this state, or if the contracts, shares or savings certificates are sold under misrepresentation or if it appears that the association is otherwise violating the provisions of this act, he shall inform the attorney general who shall then commence proceedings by writ of quo warranto against the association requiring it to show cause why its license to do business in this state should not be revoked.</p>
                  <p>(d) The state banking commissioner shall collect from foreign state savings and loan associations doing business in this state when examined in association with the supervisory authorities of the foreign state or federal government, an amount equal to the total cost of making an examination and preparing a report and the necessary travel and other expenses incident to making the examination. The examination fees and expenses shall be deposited by the state banking commissioner with the state treasurer and credited to the financial institutions administration account. Expenditures shall be made from the account by warrants drawn by the state auditor, upon vouchers issued and signed by the director or commissioner. Funds from the account shall be expended only to carry out the duties of the commissioner or the state banking board.</p>

                  <p>(a) All foreign building and loan associations doing business in this state that guarantee the time of maturity of their contracts, shares and stock certificates shall show upon their contracts, shares or stock certificates and upon their literature and passbooks the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The time of maturity of their contracts, shares or stock certificates;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The time in months in which a member may withdraw and the withdrawal value of each savings certificate, savings contract or share of stock at the end of the first eighteen (18) months and each six (6) months thereafter, printed on the face or back of them;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether or not they guarantee a maturity in months and days, and if so, the time in months and days.</p>
                  <p>(b) An association that does not guarantee the time of maturity shall state the approximate time at which shares or savings certificates will mature, based upon the past and present net earnings distributed to the members' book accounts. Maturity shall be calculated on the number of payments specified in their contracts.</p>

                  <p>(a) Borrowers may repay their loans and holders of stock or savings certificates may withdraw their accumulated savings under the same conditions and upon the same terms as are provided for domestic savings and loan associations.</p>
                  <p>(b) Shares may be withdrawn by giving thirty (30) days notice in writing of the intention to withdraw. The withdrawing shareholder shall be paid in cash, check or bank draft the amount of the withdrawal value of the shares, as shown by the last prior distribution of profits, together with all the dues paid thereon since distribution. Upon withdrawal of shares pledged to the association for stock loan, or stock loans, the association shall first deduct therefrom the indebtedness due the association. Withdrawals shall be paid in the order of their filings except as hereinafter provided, and the secretary or other officer discharging such duties shall enter upon each notice the order and date of filing. Except as hereinafter provided, not more than fifty percent (50%) of the receipts of the association in any month shall be applied to the payment of withdrawals and matured shares without the consent of the board of directors. Whenever an application for withdrawal has been on file or the payment of matured shares demanded and either has remained unpaid for six (6) months, all the receipts of the association in any month from dues, loans repaid, and the proceeds of all other investments shall, after the payment of expenses and general indebtedness, be applied toward the payment of withdrawals and matured stock. The board of directors or the banking commissioner may direct that withdrawals be paid upon a ratable and proportionate basis. After filing the notice of withdrawal provided herein the withdrawing member is entitled to the dividends credited to the same class of shares, until the final payment of his shares is made and membership in the association shall remain unimpaired so long as any accumulation remains to his credit. No officer, director, attorney, clerk or agent of an association and no person in any way interested or concerned in the management of its affairs shall discount or directly or indirectly purchase a share of any association, whether filed for withdrawal or not, except by payment therefor of the withdrawal value of the shares as determined herein. The board of directors of any association may retire all classes of free shares by enforcing withdrawals of the shares. The bylaws shall clearly state the manner in which withdrawals may be enforced. The holders of shares to be withdrawn shall be paid the full value of the shares, including, in such case, their proportion of the contingent fund.</p>

                  <p>(iii) Enter into contracts with any bank supervisory agency having concurrent jurisdiction over a bank service corporation to engage the services of the agency's examiners as provided in W.S. 13-2-807(d);</p>

                  <p>(a) In deciding whether to approve an application for a proposed acquisition under this article, the commissioner shall consider whether:</p>
                  <p>(i) There is or recently has been evidence of criminal activity on the part of the applicant or any of its officers or directors;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The acquisition may be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the Wyoming bank or the Wyoming bank holding company to be acquired;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The acquisition may result in a substantial reduction of competition in this state; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) The acquisition may have a significantly adverse effect on the convenience and needs of the community or communities in this state that are served by the Wyoming state bank or the Wyoming bank holding company to be acquired.</p>
                  <p>(b) The commissioner shall not approve an acquisition under this article if upon consummation of the transaction the applicant, including any insured depository institution affiliated with the applicant, would control thirty percent (30%) or more of the total amount of deposits held by insured depository institutions in this state. Nothing in this subsection prohibits the acquisition of a Wyoming bank or Wyoming bank holding company which controls thirty percent (30%) or more of the total deposits held by all insured depository institutions in this state if the company making the acquisition does not control any bank holding company, bank or branch bank in this state.</p>
                  <p>(c) The commissioner shall not approve an application by an out-of-state bank holding company for an acquisition under this article unless the Wyoming bank to be acquired or all Wyoming bank subsidiaries of the bank holding company to be acquired, or a predecessor, have as of the proposed date of acquisition been in existence and in continuous operation for at least three (3) years. A state bank resulting from the conversion of a federally chartered savings and loan, federally chartered savings bank or state savings and loan pursuant to W.S. 13-4-109 or a national bank resulting from the conversion of a federally chartered savings and loan or federally chartered savings bank pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the laws of the United States shall be deemed to have been in existence for the same period of time as the converting federally chartered savings and loan, federally chartered savings bank or state savings and loan or a predecessor.</p>

                  <p>(a) After notice and opportunity for hearing, the commissioner may issue a final order removing an officer or director of a Wyoming financial institution or a bank holding company if the officer or director:</p>
                  <p>(i) Has violated any state statute or rule relating to financial institutions in performing the duties of his office;</p>

                  <p>(a) If the commissioner believes the actions of the officer or director pose an immediate threat to the safety and soundness of a Wyoming financial institution or to the interests of the depositors, creditors or shareholders of the financial institution, the commissioner may suspend the officer or director pending final action on the proposed removal order issued pursuant to W.S. 13-10-205.

                <p>(a) The commissioner may call for reports verified under oath from a special purpose depository institution at any time as necessary to inform the commissioner of the condition of the institution.</p>
                <p>(b) All reports required of special purpose depository institutions by the commissioner and all materials relating to examinations of these institutions shall be subject to the provisions of W.S. 9-1-512.</p>
                <p>(c) Every special purpose depository institution is subject to the examination of the commissioner. The commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall visit and examine special purpose depository institutions on a schedule established by rule. The commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall make a complete and careful examination of the condition and resources of a special purpose depository institution, the mode of managing institution affairs and conducting business, the actions of officers and directors in the investment and disposition of funds, the safety and prudence of institution management, compliance with the requirements of this chapter and such other matters as the commissioner may require. After an examination, the special purpose depository institution shall remit to the commissioner an amount equal to the total cost of the examination.

Supervisory fees under this section shall provide for the operating costs of the office of the commissioner and the administration of the laws governing special purpose depository institutions. Such fees shall be established by rule of the commissioner and shall be adjusted by the commissioner to assure consistency with the cost of supervision. Supervisory fees shall be deposited by the commissioner with the state treasurer and credited to the special purpose depository institutions subaccount created by W.S. 13-12-111(d).</p>
                <p>(e) A special purpose depository institution shall maintain appropriate insurance or a bond covering the operational risks of the institution, which shall include coverage for directors' and officers' liability, errors and omissions liability and information technology infrastructure and activities liability.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>13-12-123. Voluntary dissolution of special purpose depository institution; liquidation; reorganization; application for dissolution; filing fee; filing with the secretary of state; revocation of charter.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A special purpose depository institution may voluntarily dissolve in accordance with the provisions of this section. Voluntary dissolution shall be accomplished by either liquidating the special purpose depository institution or reorganizing the institution into an appropriate business entity that does not engage in any activity authorized only for a special purpose depository institution. Upon complete liquidation or completion of the reorganization, the commissioner shall revoke the charter of the special purpose depository institution and afterward, the company shall not use the word "special purpose depository institution" or "bank" in its business name or in connection with its ongoing business.</p>
                <p>(b) The special purpose depository institution may dissolve its charter either by liquidation or reorganization. The board of directors shall file an application for dissolution with the commissioner, accompanied by a filing fee established by rule of the commissioner. The application shall include a comprehensive plan for dissolution setting forth the proposed disposition of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect a liquidation or reorganization, and any other plans required by the commissioner. The plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge or assumption of all of the known and unknown claims and liabilities of the special purpose depository institution. Additionally, the application for dissolution shall include other evidence, certifications, affidavits, documents or information as the commissioner may require, including demonstration of how assets and liabilities will be disposed, the timetable for effecting disposition of the assets and liabilities and a proposal of the special purpose depository institution for addressing any claims that are asserted after dissolution has been completed. The commissioner shall examine the application for compliance with this section, the business entity laws applicable to the required type of dissolution and applicable rules. The commissioner may conduct a special examination of the special purpose depository institution, consistent with W.S. 13-12-119(c), for purposes of evaluating the application.</p>
                <p>(c) If the commissioner finds that the application is incomplete, the commissioner shall return it for completion not later than sixty (60) days after it is filed. If the application is found to be complete by the commissioner, the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the application not later than thirty (30) days after it is filed. If the commissioner approves the application, the special purpose depository institution may proceed with the dissolution pursuant to the plan outlined in the application, subject to any further conditions the commissioner may prescribe. If the special purpose depository institution subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution needs to be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the commissioner and obtain approval to proceed under the amended plan. If the commissioner does not approve the application or amended plan, the special purpose depository institution may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                <p>(d) Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and satisfaction of all conditions prescribed by the commissioner, the special purpose depository institution shall submit a written report of its actions to the commissioner. The report shall contain a certification made under oath that the report is true and correct. Following receipt of the report, the commissioner, no later than sixty (60) days after the filing of the report, shall examine the special purpose depository institution to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the commissioner. If all requirements and conditions have been met, the commissioner shall, within thirty (30) days of the examination, notify the special purpose depository institution in writing that the dissolution has been completed and issue a certificate of dissolution.</p>
                <p>(e) Upon receiving a certificate of dissolution, the special purpose depository institution shall surrender its charter to the commissioner. The special purpose depository institution shall then file articles of dissolution and other documents required by W.S. 17-16-1401 through 17-16-1440 for a corporation with the secretary of state. In the case of reorganization, the special purpose depository institution shall file the documents required by the secretary of state to finalize the reorganization.</p>
                <p>(f) If the commissioner determines that all required actions under the plan for dissolution, or as otherwise required by the commissioner, have not been completed, the commissioner shall notify the special purpose depository institution, not later than thirty (30) days after this determination, in writing what additional actions shall be taken in order for the institution to be eligible for a certificate of dissolution. The commissioner shall establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence that additional actions have been taken and the commissioner may extend any deadline upon good cause. If the special purpose depository institution fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the special purpose depository institution in writing that its voluntary dissolution is not approved, and the institution may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
