                  <p>(a) Deposits by minors or other persons under a legal disability may be paid on the order of the depositor and the payments are legally valid.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any portion of a deposit by two (2) or more persons payable to either or any depositor, or to the survivor of the depositors, and interest or dividends thereon, may be paid in accordance with the contract of deposit.

                  <p>(c) Any portion of a deposit by any person in trust for another and interest or dividends thereon, in the absence of other written notice to the financial institution of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust, may be paid to the persons for whom the deposit was made in the event of death of the depositor.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any payable on death (P.O.D.) account may be paid, on request, to any original party to the account. Payment may be made, on request, to the P.O.D. payee or in equal proportions to multiple P.O.D. payees upon presentation to the financial institution of proof of death showing that the P.O.D. payee or payees survived all persons named as original payees. Payment may be made to the personal representative or heirs of a deceased original payee if proof of death is presented to the financial institution showing that his decedent was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as an original payee or as P.O.D. payee. The receipt of the payment by the person paid is a valid and sufficient release and discharge to the financial institution for any payment made. A person named as a payee in a P.O.D. account has no enforceable rights therein during the lifetime of the person or persons creating the account. As used in this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(i) "P.O.D. account" means an account payable on request to one (1) person during his lifetime and on his death to one (1) or more P.O.D. payees, or to one (1) or more persons during their lifetimes and on the death of all of them to one (1) or more P.O.D. payees;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "P.O.D. payee" means a person designated on a P.O.D. account as one to whom the account is payable on request after the death of all original payees.</p>

                  <p>(B) Agrees to indemnify and hold harmless from all claims whatsoever any party delivering assets on the basis of such affidavit, to the extent of the full value of the assets so delivered; and</p>

                  <p>(a) If any person dies who is the owner of personal or real property, including mineral interests, but whose entire estate including personal property does not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), less liens and encumbrances, the person or persons claiming to be the distributee or distributees of the decedent may file, not earlier than thirty (30) days after the decedent's death, an application for a decree of summary distribution of property.</p>
                  <p>(b) The application shall be sworn to and signed by any person claiming to be a distributee and shall state the facts required by W.S. 2-1-201(a)(i) through (v). The application shall also fully describe any real property, including any mineral interests, being claimed.</p>
                  <p>(c) The application shall have attached thereto a sworn report of value which may be based upon a broker's price opinion as defined by W.S. 33-28-102(b)(lxii), made by a person who has no legal interest in the estate, showing the value on the date of the decedent's death of all interests owned by the decedent in real property located in Wyoming, including mineral interests.</p>
                  <p>(d) Subject to subsection (j) of this section, a notice of application for a decree of summary distribution of property shall be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the application was filed. The notice of application shall be served by first class mail to the last known address, with copy of application attached, to the surviving spouse of the decedent, if any, and to all other distributees, so far as known, or to their guardians if any of them are minors, or to their personal representatives if any of them are deceased and to any reasonably ascertainable creditors not later than ten (10) days after the date of first publication.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the decedent received medical assistance pursuant to W.S. 42-4-101 through 42-4-114, the state department of health shall be provided a copy of the application for a decree within ten (10) days after the date of first publication.</p>
                  <p>(f) An objection to an application shall be filed before the expiration of the later of twenty (20) days after the mailing required by subsection (d) of this section or thirty (30) days after the date of first publication. An untimely objection is forever barred. If no timely objection is filed, the court shall enter a decree establishing the right and title to the property located in Wyoming. A certified copy of the decree shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of each county in which the real property, including mineral interests, is located. Upon recording of the decree, the decree and the record thereof shall be presumptive evidence of title to the property. If an objection to the application is filed within the time provided in this subsection, the court shall set the matter for a hearing, after which the court shall enter an order either denying or granting the application.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>2-2-101. Exclusive jurisdiction conferred on district courts.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The district courts of the state have exclusive original jurisdiction of all matters relating to the probate and contest of wills and testaments, the granting of letters testamentary and of administration, and the settlement and distribution of decedents' estates. The court granting the letters has exclusive jurisdiction of all matters touching the settlement and distribution of the estates for which letters have been granted. The jurisdiction over subject matter of the district court sitting in probate, sometimes referred to in this Title 2 as the "probate court", is coextensive with the jurisdiction over subject matter of the district court in any civil action. A decree of distribution entered by the district court in probate, pursuant to W.S. 2-7-807 or 2-7-813, shall be a final determination of title as to assets described therein, as to all distributees served with notice, or who have waived notice, of the hearing provided for in W.S. 2-7-807 or 2-7-811, as the case may be. As to all other parties, an action may be brought and maintained at any time prior to the entry of final decree of distribution under W.S. 2-7-813, by or against the personal representative in the district court, sitting in probate, seeking any legal or equitable remedy as to any interest in property, real or personal, in which the estate asserts or claims any interest. In addition, all causes cognizable in the district court in any civil action may be brought and maintained, at any time prior to the entry of final decree of distribution under W.S. 2-7-813, by or against a personal representative in the district court sitting in probate which granted the letters to the personal representative.</p>

                  <p>At or before the hearing of petitions and contests for the probate of wills, for letters testamentary or of administration, for sales of real estate and confirmation thereof, settlements, partitions, and distribution of estates, setting apart homesteads, and all other proceedings where all the parties interested in the estate are required to be notified, the court may appoint an attorney-at-law to represent the devisees, legatees, heirs or creditors of the decedent who are minors and have no general guardian in the county, or who are nonresidents of the state, and those interested who, though they are neither minors or nonresidents, are unrepresented. The order shall specify the names of the parties, so far as known, for whom the attorney is appointed. The attorney may receive a fee, to be fixed by the court, for his services, which shall be paid out of the funds of the estate as necessary expenses of administration, and upon distribution may be charged to the party represented by the attorney. If, for any cause, it becomes necessary, the court may substitute another attorney for the one first appointed, in which case the fee shall be proportionately divided. The failure to appoint an attorney will not affect the validity of any of the proceedings.</p>

                  <p>(a) A petition to mortgage or lease under W.S. 2-3-501, or a petition to transfer, sell or assign royalty, overriding royalty, leasehold or other mineral interest, or to lease the mineral interest in the property under W.S. 2-3-503, shall show:</p>
                  <p>(i) The advantage that may accrue to the estate from the lease, mortgage, transfer, sale or assignment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A general description of the property to be leased, mortgaged, sold or assigned;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The term, rental and general conditions of the proposed lease, transfer, sale or assignment, or the amount, maturity and rate of interest of the proposed mortgage;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The names of the legatees and devisees, if any, and of the heirs of the deceased, or of the minor or incompetent person, lessee, assignee or purchaser, so far as known to the petitioner.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon the filing of the petition, the court, if it deems the petition sufficient, shall set the matter for hearing and shall direct to what persons and in what manner notice of the hearing shall be given. At the hearing any person interested in the estate may appear and present objections to the proposed lease, mortgage, sale or assignment. If objections are filed to the petition, the court may adjourn the hearing to enable the parties objecting to fully present their reasons and evidence for and against the proposed lease, mortgage, sale or assignment. If no objections are filed, or if upon hearing the objections are deemed insufficient, the court may order the lease, mortgage, transfer, sale or assignment of royalty, overriding royalty, lease or other mineral interest, or lease of the mineral interest in the property, upon the terms, in the amount and for the period as is deemed proper by the court.</p>

                  <p>Proceedings may be had in the district court of each Wyoming county in which an estate in probate is being administered or a guardianship proceeding is pending, which involves real property, for authority to transfer, sell or assign royalty, overriding royalty, leasehold or other mineral interest and to lease the mineral content ownership interest in the property of any then deceased person or of any then minor or incompetent person, as distinguished from realty surface leases referred to in W.S. 2-3-501. If it appears to the court that the transfer, sale or assignment of royalty, overriding royalty, leasehold or other mineral interest or execution and delivery of a lease or contract for exploration and development of the affected real property mineral interest of the decedent, minor or incompetent person, will be advantageous to the estate of the decedent, minor or incompetent person the court, may authorize and direct the trustee, executor or administrator of the probate estate or the guardian of the estate of the minor or incompetent person, to transfer, sell or assign the royalty, overriding royalty, leasehold or other mineral interest or to lease the real estate interest or any part thereof for the mineral content purposes stated. Leases may be for primary terms of five (5) years or less as mutually agreed by the parties thereto and for so long thereafter as the mineral content, including but not restricted to oil, gas or other hydrocarbons, shall or can be produced in commercial quantities from the leasehold premises, or for the term of each unit or cooperative agreement to which the lease may be committed with the consent and approval of the court. The lease is not invalid or voidable because its effectiveness may or will extend beyond the term in office of the lessor, trustee, executor, administrator or guardian, or beyond the time of final settlement of the probate estate, or beyond the minority of the minor or the period of incompetency of the incompetent involved. With the consent and approval of the court any royalty, overriding royalty or other mineral interest or a lease may be committed to a unit or cooperative agreement, or to a secondary recovery agreement, for a like term and with like effect.</p>

                  <p>(i) Shall administer a trust or estate in accordance with the terms of the trust or the will, even if there is a different provision in this act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) May administer a trust or estate by the exercise of a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust or the will, even if the exercise of the power produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this act, and no inference that the fiduciary has improperly exercised the discretion arises from the fact that the fiduciary has made an allocation contrary to a provision of this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Shall administer a trust or estate in accordance with this act if the terms of the trust or the will do not contain a different provision or do not give the fiduciary a discretionary power of administration; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Shall add a receipt or charge a disbursement to principal to the extent that the terms of the trust and this act do not provide a rule for allocating the receipt or disbursement to or between principal and income.</p>
                  <p>(b) In exercising the power to adjust under W.S. 2-3-804(a) or a discretionary power of administration regarding a matter within the scope of this act, whether granted by the terms of a trust, a will, or this act, a fiduciary shall administer a trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one (1) or more of the beneficiaries. A determination in accordance with this act is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income, and the trustee determines, after applying the rules in W.S. 2-3-803(a), and considering any power the trustee may have under the trust to invade principal or accumulate income, that the trustee is unable to comply with W.S. 2-3-803(b).</p>
                  <p>(b) In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection (a) of this section, a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including the following factors to the extent they are relevant:</p>
                  <p>(i) The nature, purpose and expected duration of the trust;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The intent of the settlor;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The needs for liquidity, regularity of income and preservation and appreciation of capital;</p>
                  <p>(v) The assets held in the trust; the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property; the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary; and whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The net amount allocated to income under the other sections of this act and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and</p>
                  <p>(ix) The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.</p>
                  <p>(c) A trustee may not make an adjustment:</p>
                  <p>(i) That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) That reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion;</p>
                  <p>(iii) That changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;</p>
                  <p>(iv) From any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside;</p>
                  <p>(v) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;</p>
                  <p>(vii) If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust;</p>
                  <p>or</p>
                  <p>(viii) If the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly.</p>
                  <p>(d) If paragraph (c)(v), (vi), (vii) or (viii) of this section applies to a trustee and there is more than one (1) trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust.</p>
                  <p>(e) A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection (a) of this section or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in paragraphs (c)(i) through (vi) or (viii) of this section or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (c) of this section. The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.</p>
                  <p>(f) Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) Nothing in this section or in this act is intended to create or imply a duty to make an adjustment, and a trustee is not liable for not considering whether to make an adjustment or for choosing not to make an adjustment.</p>
                  <p>(h) If a trustee elects to exercise the power to adjust under this statute, the trustee may, on an annual basis, include net realized capital gains in determining trust income and section 643(a) of the Internal Revenue Code distributable net income, if the allocation is reasonable and impartial.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>2-3-805. Notice of proposed action; objections of beneficiary; liability of trustee; proceedings.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Unless a trust instrument requires otherwise, a trustee may give notice of proposed action regarding a matter governed by this act as provided in this section. For the purpose of this section, a proposed action includes a course of action and a decision not to take action.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a trustee elects to give notice under this section, the trustee shall mail notice of the proposed action to all beneficiaries who are receiving, or are entitled to receive, income under the trust or to receive a distribution of principal if the trust were terminated at the time the notice is given.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notice of proposed action need not be given to any person who consents in writing to the proposed action. The consent may be executed at any time before or after the proposed action is taken.</p>
                  <p>(d) The notice of proposed action shall state that it is given pursuant to this section and shall state all of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and mailing address of the trustee;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for additional information;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A description of the action proposed to be taken and an explanation of the reasons for the action;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The time within which objections to the proposed action can be made, which shall be at least thirty (30) days from the mailing of the notice of proposed action; and</p>
                  <p>(v) The date on or after which the proposed action may be taken or is effective.</p>
                  <p>(e) A beneficiary may object to the proposed action by mailing a written objection to the trustee at the address stated in the notice of proposed action within the time period specified in the notice of proposed action.</p>
                  <p>(f) Except for good cause shown, a trustee is not liable to a beneficiary for an action regarding a matter governed by this act if the trustee does not receive a written objection to the proposed action from the beneficiary within the applicable period and the other requirements of this section are satisfied. If no beneficiary entitled to notice objects under this section, the trustee is not liable to any current or future beneficiary with respect to the proposed action.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the trustee receives a written objection within the applicable period, either the trustee or a beneficiary may petition the court to have the proposed action taken as proposed, taken with modifications, or denied. In the proceeding, a beneficiary objecting to the proposed action has the burden of proving that the trustee's proposed action should not be taken. A beneficiary who has not objected is not estopped from opposing the proposed action in the proceeding. If the trustee decides not to implement the proposed action, the trustee shall notify the beneficiaries of the decision not to take the action and the reasons for the decision, and the trustee's decision not to implement the proposed action does not itself give rise to liability to any current or future beneficiary. A beneficiary may petition the court to have the action taken, and has the burden of proving that it should be taken.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>2-3-806. Determination and distribution of net income.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in W.S. 2-3-808 through 2-3-831 which apply to trustees and the rules in paragraph (v) of this subsection. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest under the rules in W.S. 2-3-808 through 2-3-831 which apply to trustees and by:</p>
                  <p>(A) Including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities;</p>
                  <p>(B) Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and interest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and</p>
                  <p>(C) Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust or applicable law.</p>
                  <p>(iii) A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under paragraph (ii) of this subsection or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by paragraph (iii) of this subsection in the manner described in W.S. 2-3-807 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust;</p>
                  <p>(v) A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in paragraph (i) of this subsection because of a payment described in W.S. 2-3-826 or 2-3-827 to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.</p>

                  <p>(a) Each beneficiary described in W.S. 2-3-806(a)(iv) is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one (1) distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal obligations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a fiduciary does not distribute all of the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in that net income.</p>
                  <p>(d) A fiduciary may apply the rules in this section, to the extent that the fiduciary considers it appropriate, to net gain or loss realized after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date from the disposition of a principal asset if this section applies to the income from the asset.</p>

                  <p>(a) An income beneficiary is entitled to net income from the date on which the income interest begins. An income interest begins on the date specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to a trust or successive income interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) An asset becomes subject to a trust:</p>
                  <p>(i) On the date it is transferred to the trust in the case of an asset that is transferred to a trust during the transferor's life;</p>
                  <p>(ii) On the date of a testator's death in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a trust by reason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the testator's estate; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) On the date of an individual's death in the case of an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of the individual's death.</p>
                  <p>(c) An asset becomes subject to a successive income interest on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under subsection (d) of this section, even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.</p>
                  <p>(d) An income interest ends on the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs, or on the last day of a period during which there is no beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute income.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>2-3-809. Apportionment of receipts and disbursements when decedent dies or income interest begins.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement other than one to which W.S. 2-3-806(a)(i) applies to principal if its due date occurs before a decedent dies in the case of an estate or before an income interest begins in the case of a trust or successive income interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date. An income receipt or disbursement must be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins must be allocated to principal and the balance must be allocated to income.</p>
                  <p>(c) An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payer is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of this act. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which W.S. 2-3-810 applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.</p>

                  <p>(a) In this section, "undistributed income" means net income received before the date on which an income interest ends. The term does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.</p>
                  <p>(b) When a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five percent (5%) of the trust immediately before the income interest ends. In the latter case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked must be added to principal.</p>
                  <p>(c) When a trustee's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust's assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if and to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate or other tax requirements.</p>

                  <p>(a) In this section, "entity" means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund or any other organization in which a trustee has an interest other than a trust or estate to which W.S. 2-3-811 applies, a business or activity to which W.S. 2-3-813 applies or an asset-backed security to which W.S. 2-3-825 applies.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a trustee shall allocate to income money received from an entity.</p>
                  <p>(c) A trustee shall allocate the following receipts from an entity to principal:</p>
                  <p>(i) Property other than money;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Money received in one (1) distribution or a series of related distributions in exchange for part or all of a trust's interest in the entity;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Money received in total or partial liquidation of the entity; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Money received from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust if the money distributed is a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes.</p>
                  <p>(d) Money is received in partial liquidation:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent that the entity, at or near the time of a distribution, indicates that it is a distribution in partial liquidation; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the total amount of money and property received in a distribution or series of related distributions is greater than twenty percent (20%) of the entity's gross assets, as shown by the entity's year-end financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt.</p>
                  <p>(e) Money is not received in partial liquidation, nor may it be taken into account under paragraph (d)(ii) of this section, to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of income tax that a trustee or beneficiary must pay on taxable income of the entity that distributes the money.</p>
                  <p>(f) A trustee may rely upon a statement made by an entity about the source or character of a distribution if the statement is made at or near the time of distribution by the entity's board of directors or other person or group of persons authorized to exercise powers to pay money or transfer property comparable to those of a corporation's board of directors.</p>

                  <p>A trustee shall allocate to income an amount received as a distribution of income from a trust or an estate in which the trust has an interest other than a purchased interest, and shall allocate to principal an amount received as a distribution of principal from such a trust or estate. If a trustee purchases an interest in a trust that is an investment entity, or a decedent or donor transfers an interest in such a trust to a trustee, W.S. 2-3-811 or 2-3-825 applies to a receipt from the trust.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a trustee who conducts a business or other activity determines that it is in the best interest of all the beneficiaries to account separately for the business or activity instead of accounting for it as part of the trust's general accounting records, the trustee may maintain separate accounting records for its transactions, whether or not its assets are segregated from other trust assets.</p>
                  <p>(b) A trustee who accounts separately for a business or other activity may determine the extent to which its net cash receipts must be retained for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets, and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity, and the extent to which the remaining net cash receipts are accounted for as principal or income in the trust's general accounting records. If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, the trustee shall account for the net amount received as principal in the trust's general accounting records to the extent the trustee determines that the amount received is no longer required in the conduct of the business.</p>
                  <p>(c) Activities for which a trustee may maintain separate accounting records include:</p>
                  <p>(i) Retail, manufacturing, service and other traditional business activities;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Farming;</p>

                  <p>(a) If a trustee determines that an allocation between principal and income required by W.S. 2-3-819 through 2-3-822 or 2-3-825 is insubstantial, the trustee may allocate the entire amount to principal unless one of the circumstances described in W.S. 2-3-804(c) applies to the allocation. This power may be exercised by a cotrustee in the circumstances described in W.S. 2-3-804(d) and may be released for the reasons and in the manner described in W.S. 2-3-804(e). An allocation is presumed to be insubstantial if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount of the allocation would increase or decrease net income in an accounting period, as determined before the allocation, by less than ten percent (10%); or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The value of the asset producing the receipt for which the allocation would be made is less than ten percent (10%) of the total value of the trust's assets at the beginning of the accounting period.</p>

                  <p>(a) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Payment" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one (1) or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer. For the purposes of subsections (d) through (g) of this section, the term also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Separate fund" includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus or stock-ownership plan.</p>
                  <p>(b) To the extent that a payment is characterized by the separate fund as interest, a dividend or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate it to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend or an equivalent payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) If no part of a payment is characterized by the separate fund as interest, a dividend or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten percent (10%) of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not "required to be made" to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, subsections (f) and (g) of this section shall apply, and subsection (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to:</p>
                  <p>(i) A trust to which an election to qualify for a marital deduction under section 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code has been made;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under section 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) A trust which requires payment of all trust income to the trust beneficiaries during the accounting period.</p>
                  <p>(e) Paragraph (d)(i) and subsections (f) and (g) of this section shall not apply if, and to the extent that, the series of payments would, without the application of paragraph (d)(i) of this section, qualify for the marital deduction under section 2056(b)(7)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                  <p>(f) A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a separate trust fund subject to this act. Upon request of the surviving spouse or other trust beneficiaries with the right to all the trust income, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or other trust beneficiaries with the right to all the trust income. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to the principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse or other trust beneficiaries with the right to all the trust income, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period.</p>
                  <p>(g) If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal three percent (3%) of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made.</p>
                  <p>(h) This section does not apply to payments to which W.S. 2-3-820 applies.</p>

                  <p>(a) In this section, "liquidating asset" means an asset whose value will diminish or terminate because the asset is expected to produce receipts for a period of limited duration. The term includes a leasehold, patent, copyright, royalty right and right to receive payments during a period of more than one (1) year under an arrangement that does not provide for the payment of interest on the unpaid balance. The term does not include a payment subject to W.S. 2-3-819, resources subject to W.S. 2-3-821, timber subject to W.S. 2-3-822, an activity subject to W.S. 2-3-824, an asset subject to W.S. 2-3-825 or any asset for which the trustee establishes a reserve for depreciation under W.S. 2-3-828.</p>
                  <p>(b) A trustee shall allocate to income ten percent (10%) of the receipts from a liquidating asset and the balance to principal.</p>

                  <p>(a) To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from an interest in minerals or other natural resources pursuant to this section, the trustee shall allocate them as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) If received as nominal delay rental or nominal annual rent on a lease, a receipt must be allocated to income;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If received from a production payment, a receipt must be allocated to income if and to the extent that the agreement creating the production payment provides a factor for interest or its equivalent. The balance must be allocated to principal;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If an amount received as a royalty, shut-in- well payment, take-or-pay payment, bonus or delay rental is more than nominal, twenty-seven and one-half percent (27.5%) must be allocated to principal and the balance to income;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If an amount is received from a working interest or any other interest not provided for in paragraph (i), (ii) or</p>
                  <p>(iii) of this subsection, twenty-seven and one-half percent (27.5%) of the net amount received must be allocated to principal and the balance to income.</p>
                  <p>(b) An amount received on account of an interest in water that is renewable must be allocated to income. If the water is not renewable, twenty-seven and one-half percent (27.5%) of the amount must be allocated to principal and the balance to income.</p>
                  <p>(c) This act applies whether or not a decedent or donor was extracting minerals, water or other natural resources before the interest became subject to the trust.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a trust owns an interest in minerals, water or other natural resources on the effective date of this act, the trustee may allocate receipts from the interest as provided in this act or in the manner used by the trustee before the effective date of this act. If the trust acquires an interest in minerals, water or other natural resources after the effective date of this act, the trustee shall allocate receipts as provided in this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from the sale of timber and related products pursuant to this section, the trustee shall allocate the net receipts:</p>
                  <p>(i) To income to the extent that the amount of timber removed from the land does not exceed the estimated rate of growth of the timber during the accounting periods in which a beneficiary has a mandatory income interest;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To principal to the extent that the amount of timber removed from the land exceeds the estimated rate of growth of the timber or the net receipts are from the sale of standing timber;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To or between income and principal if the net receipts are from the lease of timberland or from a contract to cut timber from land owned by a trust, by determining the amount of timber removed from the land under the lease or contract and applying the rules in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) To principal to the extent that advance payments, bonuses and other payments are not allocated pursuant to paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining net receipts to be allocated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a trustee shall deduct and transfer to principal a reasonable amount for depletion.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a marital deduction is allowed for all or part of a trust whose assets consist substantially of property that does not provide the spouse with sufficient income from or use of the trust assets, and if the amounts that the trustee transfers from principal to income under W.S. 2-3-804 and distributes to the spouse from principal pursuant to the terms of the trust are insufficient to provide the spouse with the beneficial enjoyment required to obtain the marital deduction, the spouse may require the trustee to make property productive of income, convert property within a reasonable time or exercise the power conferred by W.S. 2-3-804(a).

                  <p>(a) A tax required to be paid by a trustee based on receipts allocated to income must be paid from income.</p>
                  <p>(b) A tax required to be paid by a trustee based on receipts allocated to principal must be paid from principal, even if the tax is called an income tax by the taxing authority.</p>
                  <p>(c) A tax required to be paid by a trustee on the trust's share of an entity's taxable income must be paid proportionately:</p>
                  <p>(i) From income to the extent that receipts from the entity are allocated to income; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) From principal to the extent that:</p>
                  <p>(A) Receipts from the entity are allocated to principal; and</p>
                  <p>(B) The trust's share of the entity's taxable income exceeds the total receipts described in paragraph (i) and subparagraph (ii)(A) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(d) For purposes of this section, receipts allocated to principal or income must be reduced by the amount distributed to a beneficiary from principal or income for which the trust receives a deduction in calculating the tax.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to W.S. 2-3-826 and 2-3-827, a trustee may, in the discretion of the trustee, allocate to income, principal or partly to each, the ordinary expenses incurred in connection with the administration, management or preservation of trust property and the distribution of income including the compensation of the trustee and of agents hired by the trustee including investment advisors, custodians or income tax preparation services.</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 79, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 79, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 79, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the amount of an estate tax marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes, and as a result estate taxes paid from principal are increased and income taxes paid by an estate, trust or beneficiary are decreased, each estate, trust or beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax shall reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total reimbursement must equal the increase in the estate tax to the extent that the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction but for the payment. The proportionate share of the reimbursement for each estate, trust or beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced must be the same as its proportionate share of the total decrease in income tax. An estate or trust shall reimburse principal from income.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>2-3-832. Judicial control of discretionary powers.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A court shall not change a fiduciary's decision to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power conferred by this act unless it determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. A court shall not determine that a fiduciary abused its discretion merely because the court would have exercised the discretion in a different manner or would not have exercised the discretion.</p>
                  <p>(b) The decisions to which subsection (a) of this section applies include:</p>
                  <p>(i) A determination under W.S. 2-3-804(a) of whether and to what extent an amount should be transferred from principal to income or from income to principal;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A determination of the factors that are relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, the extent to which they are relevant, and the weight, if any, to be given to the relevant factors, in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by W.S. 2-3-804(a).</p>
                  <p>(c) If a court determines that a fiduciary has abused its discretion, the remedy is to restore the income and remainder beneficiaries to the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion, according to the following rules:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a beneficiary or a distribution that is too small, the court shall require the fiduciary to distribute from the trust to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to his appropriate position;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary that is too large, the court shall restore the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in whole or in part, to their appropriate positions by requiring the fiduciary to withhold an amount from one (1) or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or requiring that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To the extent that the court is unable, after applying paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, to restore the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, to the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion, the court may require the fiduciary to pay an appropriate amount from its own funds to one (1) or more of the beneficiaries or the trust or both.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon a petition by the fiduciary, the court having jurisdiction over the trust or estate shall determine whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the fiduciary of a discretionary power conferred by this act will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts upon which the fiduciary relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.</p>

                  <p>(a) When disclosing digital assets of a user under this act, a custodian may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Grant a fiduciary or designated recipient full access to the user's account;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the user's account sufficient to perform the tasks with which the fiduciary or designated recipient is charged; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a record of any digital asset that, on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the user could have accessed if the user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account.</p>
                  <p>(b) A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative fee for the cost of disclosing digital assets under this act.</p>
                  <p>(c) A custodian is not required to disclose under this act a digital asset deleted by a user.</p>
                  <p>(d) A custodian is not required to disclose under this act a user's digital assets if the user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose some, but not all, of the user's digital assets and the segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If a custodian finds that a direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek an order from the circuit court or other court of competent jurisdiction to disclose:</p>
                  <p>(i) A subset of the user's digital assets limited by date to the fiduciary or designated recipient;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All of the user's digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient;</p>
                  <p>(iii) None of the user's digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) All of the user's digital assets to the court for an in camera review.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a person dies intestate, property which he gave in his lifetime to an heir is treated as an advancement against the latter's share of the estate only if declared in a contemporaneous writing by the decedent or acknowledged in writing by the heir to be an advancement. For this purpose the property advanced is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property. If the recipient of the property fails to survive the decedent, the property is not taken into account in computing the intestate share to be received by the recipient's issue, unless the declaration or acknowledgment provides otherwise.</p>
                  <p>(b) The maintenance, education or supply of money to a minor, without any view to apportion or settlement in life, is not deemed an advancement under this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) When any heir of the intestate receives in his lifetime any real or personal estate by way of advancement, and the other heirs desire it to be charged to him, the judge shall cite the parties to appear before him, shall hear proof upon the subject, and shall determine the amount of such advancement or advancements to be thus charged.</p>

                <p>(a) If a married person domiciled in this state shall by will deprive the surviving spouse of more than the elective share, as hereafter set forth, of the property which is subject to disposition under the will, reduced by funeral and administration expenses, homestead allowance, family allowances and exemption, and enforceable claims, the surviving spouse has a right of election to take an elective share of that property as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) One-half (1/2) if there are no surviving issue of the decedent, or if the surviving spouse is also a parent of any of the surviving issue of the decedent; or</p>
                <p>(ii) One-fourth (1/4), if the surviving spouse is not the parent of any surviving issue of the decedent.</p>
                <p>(b) If a married person not domiciled in this state dies, the right, if any, of the surviving spouse to take an elective share in property in this state is governed by the law of the decedent's domicile at death.</p>
                <p>(c) If the surviving spouse of a married person domiciled in this state dies or becomes incompetent within three (3) months after the will is admitted to probate or before being advised of the right of election as in W.S. 2-5-104 provided, a personal representative or guardian of the estate of the deceased or incompetent surviving spouse has the same right of election as the surviving spouse would have had if living or competent.</p>
                <p>(d) If the surviving spouse or his personal representative or guardian fails to exercise the right of election within the time provided in W.S. 2-5-105, the will shall govern and control the distribution of the estate.</p>

                <p>The right of election of a surviving spouse and the rights of the surviving spouse to homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance, or any of them, may be waived totally or partially before or after marriage, by a written contract, agreement or waiver signed by the party waiving, after fair disclosure. Unless it provides to the contrary a waiver of "all rights" (or equivalent language) in the property or estate of a present or prospective spouse, or a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation of separation or divorce, is a waiver of all rights to elective share, homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance by each spouse in the property of the other and a renunciation by each of all benefits which would otherwise pass to one from the other by intestate succession or by virtue of the provisions of any will executed before the waiver or property settlement.</p>

                <p>(a) The surviving spouse, or a personal representative or guardian of the estate of a deceased or incompetent surviving spouse, may elect to take his elective share in the estate by filing in the court and mailing or delivering to the personal representative, if any, a petition for the elective share within three (3) months after the admission of the will to probate or within thirty (30) days after being advised of the right of election, whichever limitation last expires. In the event of a failure to file a petition within the foregoing time limitation the will governs and controls the distribution of the estate.</p>
                <p>(b) After the filing of a petition to elect to take an elective share, the court shall set the petition for hearing and the surviving spouse, or his personal representative or guardian, shall give notice by certified mail not less than twenty (20) days before the date of hearing of the time and place set for hearing to all persons whose interest will be adversely affected by the taking of the elective share.</p>
                <p>(c) After notice and hearing the court shall determine the right to the elective share and shall order its payment from assets of the estate. An assignment or allotment of assets by the personal representative to the elective share need not be made until the entry of a decree of distribution or such other time as may be designated by the court.</p>
                <p>(d) The surviving spouse or his personal representative or guardian may withdraw his demand for an elective share at any time before entry of a final determination by the court of the right to an elective share.</p>
                <p>(e) Any time after having been advised of the right of election, the surviving spouse or his personal representative or guardian may file with the court a renunciation or waiver of the right of election in which event the will shall govern and control the distribution of the estate.</p>

                  <p>If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator's remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.</p>

The report shall be in compliance with such of the following requirements as may be applicable:</p>
                  <p>(i) As to all assets listed in the inventory which have a readily determinable market value, the value of each asset as of date of death shall be stated in writing by one (1) disinterested person;</p>
                  <p>(ii) As to all assets listed in the inventory that do not have a readily determinable market value, the personal representative shall employ disinterested persons to determine the fair market value of each such asset, as of the date of death. A separate written report as to the value of each asset, showing the appraiser's basis for arriving at the value, shall be attached to the report.</p>
                  <p>(b) Different persons may be employed to appraise or determine the value of different assets included in the estate.</p>
                  <p>(c) The report, with any attachments required by this section, shall be filed with the clerk of court.</p>

                  <p>(b) When any person dies seized of a homestead, leaving a spouse or minor children, the spouse or minor children are entitled to the homestead. If there is neither spouse nor minor children the homestead is liable for the debts of the decedent.</p>
                  <p>(c) "Homestead" includes that property referred to in W.S. 2-7-507 to the extent in value stated in W.S. 2-7-508.</p>

                  <p>When any resident of this state dies leaving a spouse or minor children, the court shall set over to the spouse, and if none to the minor children, as their absolute property, all property of the decedent exempt from execution under the exemption laws of this state including the homestead. Such property shall not be subject to the payment of debts of the decedent, except expenses of administration or funeral expenses of the decedent in cases in which there is not other property in the estate sufficient to pay the expenses. If [the] decedent does not have any or all of the property specified under the exemption laws, the spouse or minor children are entitled to the value of the exempt property either in money or other property as they may prefer. If the surviving spouse is not the parent of all or any minor children, one-half (1/2) of the property shall be set over to the surviving spouse and the other one-half (1/2) to the minors who are not children of the survivor. A conservator shall be appointed for the children as in any other cases of estate property descending to a minor. The right of a surviving spouse to any of the exempt property is not affected by his or her renouncing or failing to renounce the benefit of the provisions made for him or her in the will of the decedent.</p>

                  <p>Any time during the administration of an estate and after the first publication of notice of opening the probate and the filing of the appraisement, any person interested may file a petition showing the necessary facts and praying to have the exempt property of the estate including the homestead set over to the person or persons entitled thereto. Upon filing of the petition, the court shall require all persons interested to appear on a day certain to show cause why the exempt property should not be set over to the person or persons entitled thereto. The order shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the probate is pending and a copy of the order to show cause shall be mailed by the personal representative to each heir and beneficiary. The publication and mailing shall be not less than ten (10) days prior to the date set for the hearing. At the time set for the hearing or to which the hearing is continued, the court shall hear the evidence and make such order as the facts and law require. If the whole estate of the decedent is found to be exempt and is set over to the person or persons entitled thereto, no further proceeding is required in the administration of the estate unless further estate is discovered. The publication and notice may be combined with and included in the notice of opening the probate, but the hearing shall not be held less than ten (10) days after the filing of the appraisement.</p>

If the funds of the estate are not sufficient for that purpose, liens or encumbrances shall be paid proportionately with other claims allowed, and the liens or encumbrances on the homestead shall only be enforced against the homestead for any deficiency remaining after the payment.</p>

If they can be divided, the appraisers shall admeasure and set apart to the parties entitled thereto the portion of the premises, including the dwelling house, as will amount in value to the homestead exemption and make report thereof giving the metes, bounds and full description of the portion set apart as a homestead.

                  <p>At any sale of real or personal property upon which there is a mortgage, pledge or other lien, the holder of the lien may become the purchaser, and may apply the amount of his lien on the purchase price. If no claim thereon has been filed or allowed, the court, at the hearing on the report of sale and for confirmation of the sale, may examine into the validity and enforceability of the lien or charge and the amount due thereunder and secured thereby, and may authorize the personal representative to accept the receipt of the purchaser for the amount due thereunder and secured thereby as payment pro tanto. If the mortgage, pledge or other lien is a valid claim against the estate and has been allowed, the receipt of the purchaser for the amount due him from the proceeds of the sale is a payment pro tanto. If the amount for which the property is purchased, whether or not a claim for it has been filed or allowed, is insufficient to defray the expenses and discharge his mortgage, pledge or other lien, the purchaser shall pay an amount sufficient to pay the balance of the expenses. Nothing permitted under this section shall be deemed to be an allowance of a claim based upon such mortgage, pledge or other lien.</p>

Prior to the time fixed for the hearing, any person receiving notice may file written objections to the entry of an order approving the sale. If the court is not satisfied that the sale, mortgage, exchange or lease has been made in conformity with law and that it is in the best interests of the estate, it may reject the sale, mortgage, exchange or lease and enter an order it deems advisable.</p>

                  <p>Where a cause of action against the decedent survives his death under W.S. 1-4-101 and 1-4-102, before an action may be brought thereon in any court, a claim based thereon shall be filed and shall have been rejected by the personal representative.

Any judgment rendered by any court with respect to which compliance with this section has not been accomplished, if sought to be enforced, shall be deemed to be a claim not timely filed under W.S. 2-7-703.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the personal representative is a creditor of the decedent he shall file his claim as other creditors, and the court shall appoint a competent person as temporary administrator to represent the estate in the matter of allowing or disallowing the claim.

                  <p>(b) The temporary administrator, after investigation, shall file a report with the court recommending the allowance or disallowance of the claim.

                  <p>(c) When such a claim is so filed, the personal representative shall proceed as provided in W.S. 2-7-712(a) and (d), and if such claim is rejected, the provisions of W.S. 2-7-717 and 2-7-718 will apply.</p>

Any demand not filed within the time limited shall be forever barred, and all claims and causes of action arising out of such demand shall likewise be forever barred.</p>

                  <p>(a) It is the policy of the state of Wyoming that the administration of estates of decedents be completed as rapidly as possible consistent with due protection of the interests of creditors, taxing authorities and distributees. To effectuate this policy, this code shall be so construed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The clerk shall maintain a calendar as to each estate opened and shall bring to the attention of the court for appropriate action by the court on its own motion, any failure of any personal representative to meet any time deadlines provided by this code.</p>
                  <p>(c) The administration of each estate of a decedent shall be completed within one (1) year from the date of appointment of the personal representative unless good cause is demonstrated to the court by a verified report filed by the personal representative, and a court order approving continuance is entered. Failure to comply with this provision may be dealt with by the court by citation for contempt, order of removal and replacement of the personal representative, or any other remedy the court deems appropriate to bring about prompt closing of the estate.</p>

                  <p>(a) The personal representative is authorized to incur and pay at any time, subject to approval upon hearing his final report and accounting, all reasonable and necessary expenses in the care, management and settlement of the estate. The personal representative's authorization shall be exercised with the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing which men of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs. Subject to the foregoing standard, the expenses may include but are not limited to services relating to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Bank accounts and safekeeping facilities;</p>

                  <p>(vii) Property insurance of all types and liability insurance;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Events incident to distribution of estate assets, such as stock transfer fees and other normal expenses incident to transfer of title;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Preparation of all necessary tax returns and reports, and audit proceedings in connection therewith, relating to the decedent and the estate and the distribution of the estate;</p>

The court shall allow the personal representative fees for ordinary services rendered to the estate unless the personal representative files a written waiver as to a part or all thereof. The fees shall be computed on the basis of the amount of the decedent's probate estate accounted for as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) For the first one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) of the basis, ten percent (10%);</p>
                  <p>(ii) For all sums over one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) but not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) of the basis, five percent (5%);</p>

                  <p>(b) In addition, further fees as are just and reasonable may be allowed by the court to the personal representative for extraordinary expenses or services actually incurred or rendered by the personal representative and necessary to the proper administration and distribution of the estate. Extraordinary services shall include but not be limited to services rendered by the personal representative relative to any tax matters and services rendered by the personal representative in connection with any litigation to which the decedent or the estate is a party.</p>
                  <p>(c) The amount of the decedent's probate estate accounted for shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Include items with which the personal representative is chargeable at their inventory value;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Deduct any loss or add any increase shown by any reappraisement or actual sale occurring during administration;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Add all accretions to the estate which have come into the possession of the personal representative such as interest, dividends and profits on sales, not including money borrowed or refunds of amounts paid by the personal representative;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Deduct the value of property lost or destroyed without fault of the personal representative; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Include accretions in net income, and not the gross income, of any business operated or conducted during administration of the estate.</p>

                  <p>(a) No fees shall be paid to the personal representative or the attorney for the estate except upon order of the court. At any time during the administration of the estate the personal representative or the attorney for the estate or both may submit a written, verified application to the court for an order allowing partial or total fees and expenses for ordinary services, or partial or total fees and expenses for extraordinary services, or both. Any application for expenses shall be supported by a written itemization of the expenses. Any application for fees for extraordinary services shall be supported by a written itemization showing the kind, nature, extent and time spent in connection with the services. If satisfied that the fees and expenses applied for or as limited by the court may be allowed and paid without detriment to any party interested in the estate or to the administration and conclusion of the estate, the court may enter an order allowing fees and expenses and authorizing payment from the estate. Any fees and expenses allowed by any order entered ex parte are subject to timely objection upon hearing of the final report and accounting.</p>
                  <p>(b) Only one (1) total fee for ordinary services of a domiciliary personal representative, computed as provided in W.S. 2-7-802, shall be allowed for any estate. Where more than one (1) person serves as a domiciliary personal representative either as co-fiduciaries or as a successor domiciliary personal representative, the court shall apportion the total fee among the parties in accordance with their agreement with each other, or absent any agreement as the court deems fair and just. The same rule shall prevail as to attorneys' fees for ordinary services in domiciliary administration, computed in accordance with W.S. 2-7-803, where more than one (1) attorney renders ordinary services to the domiciliary estate.</p>
                  <p>(c) Where one (1) person, or a partner or employee of the same professional corporation as that person, serves both as personal representative and as attorney for the estate, no fee shall be allowed as to the estate for ordinary services of a personal representative.</p>
                  <p>(d) No contingent fee shall be allowed against an estate or paid by an estate for legal services rendered to or for or on behalf of an estate, except in a proceeding for recovery for wrongful death under W.S. 1-38-101 and 1-38-102, unless before commencement of the services a written contract is entered into by the personal representative and the attorney with respect thereto and the contract is submitted to the court upon written, verified application of the personal representative and is approved by the court. No contract shall be approved if it violates any statute or rule of court. No contract shall be approved unless it appears to the court, upon due consideration of the size of the estate and the nature and extent of the legal services to be rendered, that adequate compensation of the attorney cannot be assured by allowance of fees for extraordinary services pursuant to W.S. 2-7-803.</p>
                  <p>(e) The provisions of W.S. 2-7-801 through 2-7-804 apply to personal representatives and attorneys serving in ancillary administration in Wyoming, except as the probate court in which the ancillary administration is pending may otherwise determine for good cause shown.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any contract between the personal representative or the attorney for the estate and any party interested in the estate in contravention of W.S. 2-7-802 through 2-7-804 is void.</p>

                  <p>(b) If the final report and accounting is not filed by the personal representative within one (1) year from the date of his appointment, then a verified interim report and accounting shall be filed at the end of one (1) year and annually thereafter until the final report and accounting is filed.</p>
                  <p>(c) On application of any creditor or distributee or upon its own motion, the court may order an interim report and accounting at any time embracing all matters directed by the court. The court may order reports and accountings from time to time as it determines to be in the best interests of the estate.</p>
                  <p>(d) All interim reports and accountings shall be subject to the provisions of W.S. 2-7-807(c).</p>
                  <p>(e) No interim report and accounting is binding upon any creditor or distributee unless it has been set down for hearing by the court and notice thereof given to the creditors and distributees by certified mail not less than twenty (20) days before the date of hearing.</p>

                  <p>(c) If it appears to the court there is property ready for distribution held by the personal representative over and above the amount necessary to pay the costs of administration and all just claims and taxes of the estate, the court shall direct the personal representative to distribute to each distributee his proportion of the property ready for distribution. The court may require each distributee to give bond to secure payment of his proportion of the debts and taxes of the estate.</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever any person makes entry on any land in the United States and dies before patent for the same is issued and patent thereafter is issued to the heirs at law of the decedent, any person interested in the lands as heir at law or devisee or as grantee or assignee of such heirs at law or devisee, or the personal representative of any of them if deceased, may file a petition in the district court in and for the county wherein the land or any part thereof is situate, setting forth the date of death of the decedent, the date of issuance of the patent and that the patent was issued to the heirs at law of the deceased person, the land described therein, the names, ages and residence if known of the heirs at law of the deceased persons and a request that a decree be entered by the court establishing who are the heirs at law of the deceased person. Upon filing of the petition the clerk of court shall make an order fixing the time and place of hearing of the petition not less than thirty (30) days from the filing of the petition.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notice of the time and place for hearing the petition shall be given by publishing notice thereof at least once each week for three (3) successive weeks in some newspaper of general circulation in the county and the mailing of true copies to all known heirs of the deceased person at least ten (10) days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. Proof of publication and mailing shall be made to the court upon the hearing. Any time before the date fixed for the hearing any person interested in the lands as heir at law or devisee of the decedent or as the grantee of any such heir at law or devisee, may answer the petition and deny any of the matters contained therein. At the time fixed for the hearing or at such time thereafter as may be fixed by the court, the court shall hear the proofs offered by petitioner and any person answering the same, and shall make a decree conformable to the proofs. The decree shall have the same force and effect as decrees entered in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>

                <p>(a) The probate court having jurisdiction over the administration of the estate of a decedent shall determine the apportionment of the tax. If there are no probate proceedings, the probate court of the county wherein the decedent was domiciled at death upon the application of the person required to pay the tax shall determine the apportionment of the tax.</p>
                <p>(b) If the probate court finds that it is inequitable to apportion interest and penalties in the manner provided in W.S. 2-10-103 because of special circumstances, it may direct apportionment thereof in the manner it finds equitable.</p>
                <p>(c) If the probate court finds that the assessment of penalties and interest assessed in relation to the tax is due to delay caused by the negligence of the fiduciary, the court may charge the fiduciary with the amount of the assessed penalties and interest.</p>
                <p>(d) In any suit or judicial proceeding to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with this act, the determination of the probate court in respect thereto shall be prima facie correct.</p>

                <p>(a) The fiduciary or other person in possession of the property of the decedent required to pay the tax may withhold from any property distributable to any person interested in the estate, upon his distribution to him, the amount of tax attributable to his interest. If the property in possession of the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax and distributable to any person interested in the estate is insufficient to satisfy the proportionate amount of the tax determined to be due from the person, the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax may recover the deficiency from the person interested in the estate. If the property is not in the possession of the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax, the fiduciary or the other person required to pay the tax may recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with this act.</p>
                <p>(b) If property held by the fiduciary is distributed prior to final apportionment of the tax, the distributee shall provide a bond or other security for the apportionment liability in the form and amount prescribed by the fiduciary, with the approval of the probate court having jurisdiction of the administration of the estate.</p>

                <p>(a) In making an apportionment, allowances shall be made for any exemptions granted and for any deductions and credits allowed by the law imposing the tax.</p>
                <p>(b) Any exemption or deduction allowed by reason of the relationship of any person to the decedent or by reason of the purposes of the gift shall inure to the benefit of the person bearing such relationship or receiving the gift; except that when an interest is subject to a prior present interest which is now allowable as a deduction, the tax apportionable against the present interest shall be paid from principal.</p>
                <p>(c) Any deduction for property previously taxed and any credit for gift taxes or death taxes of a foreign country paid by the decedent or his estate shall inure to the proportionate benefit of all persons liable to apportionment.</p>
                <p>(d) Any credit for inheritance, succession or estate taxes or taxes in the nature thereof in respect to property or interests includable in the estate shall inure to the benefit of the persons or interests chargeable with the payment thereof to the extent that, or in proportion as the credit reduces the tax.</p>
                <p>(e) To the extent that property passing to or in trust for a surviving spouse or any charitable, public or similar gift or bequest does not constitute an allowable deduction for purposes of the tax solely by reason of an inheritance tax or other death tax imposed upon and deductible from the property, the property shall not be included in the computation provided for in W.S. 2-10-103 and to that extent no apportionment shall be made against the property. The sentence immediately preceding shall not apply to any case where the result will be to deprive the estate of a deduction otherwise allowable under applicable gift and estate laws, relating to deduction for state death taxes on transfers for public, charitable or religious uses.</p>

                <p>Neither the fiduciary nor other person required to pay the tax shall be under any duty to institute any suit or proceeding to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person until the expiration of the three (3) months next following final determination of the tax. A fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax who institutes the suit or proceeding within a reasonable time after the three (3) months period shall not be subject to any liability or surcharge because any portion of the tax apportioned to any person interested in the estate was collectible at a time following the death of the decedent but thereafter became uncollectible. If the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax cannot collect from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person, the amount not recoverable shall be equitably apportioned among the other persons interested in the estate who are subject to apportionment.</p>

For the purposes of the action the determination of apportionment by the court having jurisdiction of the administration of the decedent's estate in the other state shall be prima facie correct.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>2-11-202. Nonresident property in Wyoming; disposition.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) In case of a nonresident's estate having property in this state not exceeding in value the sum of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), which estate is being duly probated and settled in another state, the Wyoming district judge may enter an order for the sale of the property located in this state provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) The petitioner files with the district judge in the proper county a petition under oath showing the facts in the case together with certified copies of the petition, order of appointment of executor or administrator, notice to creditors showing that the time for filing claims has expired, and inventory of the Wyoming estate;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The petitioner files a certified copy of an order authorizing sale or other disposition of Wyoming property issued by the court having jurisdiction over the estate being probated in another state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The district judge gives notice by publication for three (3) weeks of the intention of the petitioner to have the property located in this state subject to sale or other disposition; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) If on the day set for hearing the petition no objection is made, the judge shall make an order admitting the certified copies of the proceedings in the estate and the order authorizing sale or other disposition of Wyoming property to record in his court and they shall be considered and treated from that time as original proceedings in his court and shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein shown.</p>
                  <p>(b) If on the day set for hearing the petition any creditor objects to the sale or other disposition of the Wyoming property, his claim not having been presented in the original state, the matter shall be postponed and the petition denied. This section shall not be construed to prevent the courts of this state from appointing a temporary administrator in this state to collect and preserve the property of the estate of the deceased person which may be located in this state.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>2-11-301. Naming of executors and trustees; generally; appointment of agents for service; bond when executor sole legatee; applicability of provisions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The testator may name in his will as executor or trustee any person or persons who are residents and citizens of the United States, or any bank or trust company organized under the laws of this state or of the United States and doing business in this state. When it appears to the court having jurisdiction that any individual named as an executor or trustee in any will is not a resident of this state or that any bank or trust company named as executor or trustee is not authorized to do business in this state, the court shall require the executor or trustee to designate a resident, bank or trust company of this state as agent or attorney upon whom any order, notice or process issued out of the courts of this state may be served. Service on the agent or attorney has the same effect as if served upon the nonresident executor or trustee in person. If any nonresident executor or trustee fails to appoint an agent or attorney, the court shall revoke his authority to act. When the person named as executor is also the sole legatee, instead of the bond required by other provisions herein of an executor, he may give a bond to the state in a sum and with sureties the court requires, conditioned only to pay within the time fixed by the court all the debts of the testator which are filed or exhibited within the time fixed by the notice to creditors. He shall return an inventory and appraisement as in other cases. Upon execution and approval of the bond, the filing of the inventory and appraisement and the publication of notice to creditors, the estate of the testator vests absolutely in the sole legatee and the debts of the testator so filed or exhibited become charges against the legatee. Upon breach of the condition of the bond, suit may be instituted on the bond by any creditor in the name of the state for the use of the creditor. The provisions hereof apply to all wills hereafter admitted to probate.</p>

                  <p>The power of a domiciliary foreign personal representative under W.S. 2-11-302 shall be exercised only if there is no administration or application therefor pending in this state. A petition for local administration of the estate terminates the power of the foreign personal representative to act under W.S. 2-11-302 but the local court may allow the foreign personal representative to exercise limited powers to preserve the estate. No person who before receiving actual notice of a pending local administration has changed his position in reliance upon the powers of a foreign personal representative shall be prejudiced by reason of the petition for or grant of local administration. The local personal representative is subject to all duties and obligations which have accrued by virtue of the exercise of the powers by the foreign personal representative and may be substituted for him in any action or proceedings in this state.</p>

                <p>On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interest as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.</p>

                <p>(a) A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form. If a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to the registering entity by this act.</p>
                <p>(b) By accepting a request for registration of a security in beneficiary form, the registering entity agrees that the registration will be implemented on death of the deceased owner as provided in this act.</p>
                <p>(c) A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs or devisees of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with W.S. 2-16-108 and does so in good faith reliance (1) on the registration, (2) on this act, and (3) on information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary's representatives, or other information available to the registering entity. The protections of this act do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from any claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form. No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under this act.</p>
                <p>(d) The protection provided by this act to the registering entity of a security does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its value or proceeds.</p>

                <p>A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests (1) for registrations in beneficiary form, and (2) for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for "lineal descendants per stirpes." This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one (1) or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.</p>

                <p>(a) If a decedent leaves written instructions regarding his entombment, burial or cremation, or a document that designates and authorizes another person to direct disposition of the decedent's body the funeral director or funeral service practitioner to whom the body is entrusted shall proceed with the disposition of the body in accordance with those instructions or the instructions given by the person designated to direct disposition of the decedent's body. A document that designates another person to direct disposition of the decedent's body drafted pursuant to service in the military and in a form mandated by federal law at the time it was signed shall be recognized as valid for purposes of this section. In the event a decedent does not leave written instructions regarding his entombment, burial or cremation, or fails to leave a document designating another person to direct disposition of the decedent's body, the funeral director or funeral service practitioner to whom the body is entrusted shall obtain a signed consent before the entombment, burial or cremation proceeds.</p>
                <p>(b) Any of the following persons, in order of priority as stated, may consent to the entombment, burial or cremation of the decedent, provided no written instructions or a document designating another person to direct disposition of the decedent's body were left by the decedent:</p>
                <p>(i) The decedent's spouse at the time of death;</p>
                <p>(ii) An adult child of the decedent;</p>
                <p>(iii) Either parent of the decedent;</p>
                <p>(iv) An adult sibling of the decedent;</p>
                <p>(v) A grandparent of the decedent;</p>
                <p>(vi) A stepchild of the decedent;</p>
                <p>(vii) A guardian of the decedent in accordance with W.S. 3-2-201(a)(x).</p>
                <p>(c) If a funeral director or funeral service practitioner receives written consent from a person specified in subsection</p>
                <p>(b) of this section, he may act in accordance with the consent, unless a person with a higher or equal priority provides the funeral director or funeral service practitioner a contrary written consent within three (3) days. If the funeral director or funeral service practitioner has been provided contrary written consents from members of the same class with the highest priority as to the entombment, burial or cremation of the decedent, the director or funeral service practitioner shall act in accordance with the directive of the greatest number of consents received from members of the class. If that number is equal, the director or funeral service practitioner shall act in accordance with the earlier consent unless the person providing the later consent is granted an order from the district court for the county in which the funeral establishment is located. The district court shall order disposition in accordance with the later consent only if it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence the disposition is in accordance with the decedent's wishes.</p>
                <p>(d) If the decedent is not survived by any member of the classes listed or no member of those classes is competent to sign a consent, any person who comes forward and legitimately identifies himself as another level of relation or friend of the decedent is authorized to sign the consent. If no consent is received within seven (7) days of the decedent's death, the coroner for the county in which the funeral establishment is located is authorized to sign the consent.</p>
                <p>(e) A funeral director or funeral service practitioner acting in accordance with this section, or attempting in good faith to act in accordance with this section, shall be immune from civil liability.</p>
                <p>(f) Nothing in this section abrogates or amends the intestate succession laws of W.S. 2-4-101 through 2-4-214.</p>

                <p>(iii) "Successor grantee beneficiary" means the person to whom an owner grants an interest in the real property that is the subject of the transfer on death deed if the primary grantee beneficiary does not survive the owner;</p>
                <p>(iv) "Transfer on death deed" means a deed authorized by W.S. 2-18-103.</p>

              <content>
                <p><shortTitle>2-18-103. Transfer on death deed.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A deed that conveys an interest in real property, including any debt secured by a lien on real property, to a grantee beneficiary designated by the owner and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the owner transfers the deceased owner's interest to the grantee beneficiary designated by name in the transfer on death deed effective on the death of the owner, subject to all conveyances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges, and other encumbrances made by the owner or to which the owner was subject during the owner's lifetime. The grantee beneficiary also takes title subject to any interest in the property of which the grantee beneficiary has either actual or constructive notice.</p>
                <p>(b) A transfer on death deed may designate multiple grantees who take title as joint tenants with right of survivorship, tenants in common, or any other tenancy that is valid under the laws of this state.</p>
                <p>(c) A transfer on death deed may designate a successor grantee beneficiary. If the transfer on death deed designates a successor grantee beneficiary, the deed must state the condition on which the interest of the successor grantee beneficiary would vest.</p>
                <p>(d) If real property is owned by persons as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, a deed that conveys an interest in the real property to a grantee beneficiary designated by all of the then surviving owners and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the last surviving owner transfers the interest to the designated grantee beneficiary effective on the death of the last surviving owner. If a transfer on death deed is executed by fewer than all of the owners of real property owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the transfer on death deed is valid if the last surviving owner is one of the persons who executes the transfer on death deed. If the last surviving owner did not execute the transfer on death deed, the transfer lapses and the deed is void. An estate in joint tenancy with right of survivorship is not affected by the execution of a transfer on death deed that is executed by fewer than all of the owners of the real property, and the rights of a surviving joint tenant with right of survivorship prevail over a grantee beneficiary named in a transfer on death deed.</p>
                <p>(e) A transfer on death deed is valid only if the deed is executed and recorded, as provided by law, in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the real property is situated, before the death of the owner or the last surviving owner. A transfer on death deed may be used to transfer an interest in real property to the trustee of a trust even if the trust is revocable.</p>
                <p>(f) A transfer on death deed may be revoked at any time by the owner or, if there is more than one (1) owner, by any of the owners who executed the transfer on death deed. To be effective, the revocation must be executed and recorded, as provided by law, in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the real property is situated, before the death of the owner who executes the revocation. If the real property is owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship and if the revocation is not executed by all the owners who executed the transfer on death deed, the revocation is not effective unless executed by the last surviving owner.</p>
                <p>(g) If an individual who is a recipient of medical assistance for which it would be permissible for the department of health to file a claim pursuant to W.S. 42-4-206 or to assert a lien pursuant to W.S. 42-4-207 conveys an interest in real property by means of a transfer on death deed, the department of health may assert a lien against the property that is the subject of the transfer on death deed for the amount which would have been recoverable against the owner's estate pursuant to W.S. 42-4-206 and may file a lien against the property pursuant to W.S. 42-4-207.</p>
                <p>(h) If an owner executes and records more than one (1) transfer on death deed concerning the same real property, the last transfer on death deed that is recorded before the owner's death is the effective transfer on death deed.</p>
                <p>(j) This section does not prohibit other methods of conveying property that are permitted by law and that have the effect of postponing enjoyment of an interest in real property until the death of the owner. This section does not invalidate any deed otherwise effective by law to convey title to the interests and estates provided in the deed that is not recorded until after the death of the owner.</p>
                <p>(k) The signature, consent, or agreement of, or notice to, a grantee beneficiary of a transfer on death deed is not required for any purpose during the lifetime of the owner.</p>
                <p>(m) A transfer on death deed that is executed, acknowledged, and recorded in accordance with this section is not revoked by the provisions of a will.</p>
                <p>(n) Proof of the death of the owner or a grantee beneficiary and transfer of ownership of the property by operation of law shall be established exclusively as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) By recording an affidavit as provided under W.S. 34-11-101 and an accompanying certificate of clearance;</p>
                <p>(ii) The affidavit and accompanying certificate of clearance shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the real property is situated. The affidavit shall identify the transfer on death deed by deed book and page or document number. The certificate of clearance shall be issued by the Wyoming department of health and shall certify that all medical assistance claims have either been satisfied or do not exist.</p>
                <p>(o) Title to the interest in real property transferred by a transfer on death deed shall vest in the designated grantee beneficiary only on the death of the owner.</p>
