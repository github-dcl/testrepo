                  <p>(a) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a waiver of any benefits, privileges, immunities or rights otherwise provided for national guard personnel performing duty pursuant to title 32 of the United States Code nor shall anything in this compact be construed as a waiver of coverage provided for under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In the event that national guard personnel performing counter-drug activities do not receive rights, benefits, privileges and immunities otherwise provided for national guard personnel as stated above, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whenever national guard forces of any responding state are engaged in another state in carrying out the purposes of this compact, the members thereof so engaged shall have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as members of national guard forces of the requesting state. The requesting state shall save and hold members of the national guard forces of responding states harmless from civil liability, except as otherwise provided herein, for acts or omissions which occur in the performance of their duty while engaged in carrying out the purposes of this compact, whether responding forces are serving the requesting state within the borders of the responding state or are attached to the requesting state for purposes of operational control;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subject to the paragraphs (a)(iii), (iv) and (v) of this article, all liability that may arise under the laws of the requesting state or the responding state, on account of or in connection with a request for assistance or support shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any responding state rendering aid or assistance pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the requesting state for any loss, damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid and for the cost of the materials, transportation and maintenance of national guard personnel and equipment incurred in connection with such request, provided that nothing contained herein shall prevent any responding state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Unless there is a written agreement to the contrary, each party shall provide in the same amounts and manner as if they were on duty within their state for pay and allowances of personnel of its national guard units while engaged without the state pursuant to this compact and while going to and returning from such duty pursuant to this compact;</p>
                  <p>(v) Each party state providing for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members and the representatives of deceased members of its national guard forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed within their own state, shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits in the same manner and on the same terms in the event such members sustain injury or are killed while rendering assistance or support pursuant to this compact. Such benefits and compensation shall be deemed items of expense reimbursable pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii) of this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) Officers and enlisted personnel of the national guard performing duties subject to proper orders pursuant to this compact shall be subject to and governed by the provisions of their home state code of military justice whether they are performing duties within or without their home state. In the event that any national guard member commits, or is suspected of committing, a criminal offense while performing duties pursuant to this compact without his home state, he may be returned immediately to his home state and the home state shall be responsible for any disciplinary action. Nothing in this section shall abrogate the general criminal jurisdiction of the state in which the offense occurred.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE V</p>
                  <p>Delegation</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent the governor of a party state from delegating any of his responsibilities or authority respecting the national guard, provided that such delegation is otherwise in accordance with law. For purposes of this compact the governor shall not delegate the power to request assistance from another state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>Limitations</p>
                  <p>(a) Nothing in this compact shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Authorize or permit national guard units or personnel to be placed under the operational control of any person not having the national guard rank or status required by law for that command;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Deprive a properly convened court of jurisdiction over an offense or a defendant merely because of the fact that the national guard, while performing duties pursuant to this compact, was utilized in achieving an arrest or indictment; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Authorize the national guard to engage in the personal apprehension, arrest and incarceration of any individual or the physical search and seizure of any person. The national guard may indirectly support any such law- enforcement activities by an otherwise appropriate law- enforcement agency.

                  <p>ARTICLE VII</p>
                  <p>Construction and Severability</p>
                  <p>This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of the United States or of any state or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or the circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining part states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p>(d) An employer is not required to reemploy a person under this section if the employer demonstrates that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The employer's circumstances have so changed as to make reemployment impossible or unreasonable;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The reemployment would impose an undue hardship on the employer; and</p>

                  <p>(A) Not later than the beginning of the first full regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day following the completion of the period of service and the expiration of eight (8) hours after a period allowing for the safe transportation of the person from the place of that service to the person's residence;</p>

                  <p>(ii) In the case of a person who is absent from a position of employment for a period of any length for the purposes of an examination to determine the person's fitness to perform service in the uniformed services, by reporting in the manner and time referred to in paragraph (i) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than thirty (30) days but less than one hundred eighty-one (181) days, by submitting an application for reemployment with the employer not later than fourteen (14) days after the completion of the period of service or if submitting such application within such period is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the person, the next first full calendar day when submission of such application becomes possible; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) In the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than one hundred eighty- one (181) days, by submitting an application for reemployment with the employer not later than ninety (90) days after the completion of the period of service.</p>
                  <p>(f) A person who is hospitalized for, or convalescing from, an illness or injury incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of service in the uniformed service, shall, at the end of the period that is necessary for the person to recover from such illness or injury, report to the person's employer, in the case of a person described in paragraphs (e)(i) and (ii) of this section or submit an application for reemployment with his employer, in the case of a person described in paragraphs (e)(iii) and (iv) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(ii) of this section, such period of recovery may not exceed two (2) years. The two (2) years shall be extended by the minimum time required to accommodate the circumstances beyond such person's control which makes reporting within the period specified in paragraph (e)(i) of this section impossible or unreasonable. A person who fails to report or apply for employment or reemployment within the appropriate period specified in subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall not automatically forfeit his entitlement to the rights and benefits referred to in subsection (a) of this section but shall be subject to the conduct, rules, established policy and general practices of the employer pertaining to explanations and discipline with respect to absence from scheduled work.</p>
                  <p>(g) A person who submits an application for reemployment in accordance with paragraph (e)(iii) or (iv) of this section shall provide, upon request by the person's employer, to the person's employer documentation to establish the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The person's application is timely;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The person has not exceeded the service limitations set forth in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, except as permitted under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>

                  <p>(h) Documentation of any matter referred to in subsection</p>
                  <p>(g) of this section that satisfies regulations prescribed by the adjutant general shall satisfy the documentation requirements in subsection (g) of this section. Failure to provide documentation that satisfies regulations prescribed by the adjutant general shall not be a basis for denying reemployment in accordance with the provisions of this section if the failure occurs because the documentation does not exist or is not readily available at the time of the request of the employer. If, after reemployment, documentation becomes available that establishes that the person does not meet one (1) or more of the requirements referred to in paragraph (g)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section, the employer of the person may terminate the employment of the person and the provision of any rights or benefits afforded the person under this section. An employer who reemploys a person absent from a position of employment for more than ninety (90) days may require that the person provide the employer with the documentation referred to in this subsection and subsection (g) of this section before beginning to treat the person as not having incurred a break in service for pension purposes. An employer may not delay or attempt to defeat a reemployment obligation by demanding documentation that does not then exist or is not then readily available.</p>
                  <p>(j) The right of a person to reemployment under this section shall not entitle such person to retention, preference or displacement rights over any person with a superior claim under the provisions of title 5, United States Code, relating to veterans and other preference eligibility.</p>
                  <p>(k) In any determination of a person's entitlement to protection under this section, the timing, frequency and duration of the person's training or service, or the nature of such training or service, including voluntary service, in the uniformed services, shall not be a basis for denying protection under this section if the service does not exceed the limitations set forth in subsection (c) of this section the notice requirements established in paragraph (a)(i) of this subsection and the notification requirements established in subsection (e) of this section are met.</p>
                  <p>(m) Any employee, who applies for reemployment in accordance with the provisions of this law, shall be entitled to complete any training program that was applicable to his former position of employment during his period of service in the uniformed services.</p>
                  <p>(n) Any employee who is restored to or employed in a position in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not be discharged from such position without cause within one (1) year after such restoration or reemployment.</p>
                  <p>(o) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall be reinstated to his former position as a teacher immediately upon application and shall be entitled to receive that compensation which he would have received if he would have been employed on a nine (9) month basis and had prorated his salary over twelve (12) months. The employee shall be reinstated prior to the end of the twelve (12) months.</p>
                  <p>(p) A person who is reemployed under this section is entitled to the seniority and other rights and benefits determined by seniority that the person had on the date of the commencement of service in the uniformed services plus the additional seniority, rights and benefits that such person would have attained if the person had remained continuously employed.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any employee who did not elect to make employee contributions pursuant to W.S. 19-11-113 to the state retirement system applicable to his employment during his period of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to receive credit for his service in the uniformed services toward establishing retirement eligibility and for computation of benefits upon payment into the system in an amount equal to the employee contributions that would have been paid had the employee continued in employment and not been called to service in the uniformed services, together with interest thereon at the valuation interest rate of the system or plan in effect at the time payment is made. The contributions shall be based on the salary including any increases in compensation that the employee would have received had he remained in employment during the period of service in the uniformed services.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon payment by the employee of the employee contributions and interest as provided in subsection (a) of this section the employer shall pay to the retirement system an amount equal to the employer contributions that the employer would have paid to the retirement system had the employee remained in service, together with interest thereon, at the valuation interest rate in effect at the time payment is made.

The employer contributions and interest due to the system shall be paid within thirty (30) days after the employee has paid all of the contributions due to the system or fund.</p>
                  <p>(c) All employee contributions and interest due thereon made in payment for service in the uniformed services credit in accordance with subsection (a) of this section must be received by the system within five (5) years of his reemployment.</p>
                  <p>(d) Should the employee fail to make the required contributions within four (4) years, the credit shall only count toward determining eligibility for retirement benefits. Any unpaid actuarial cost to the retirement system shall be borne by the employers through reflection in the employer rate established by the state retirement system’s actuarial committee.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding any other requirements in W.S. 19-11-113 or 19-11-114 or this section relating to payment of retirement contributions to a public or private retirement system, employer and employee contributions for any public or private retirement or pension system plan, not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per person per year, may be paid by the Wyoming adjutant general, if the payment is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, for any person whose primary occupation is that of a first responder and who is called or ordered into the federal service of the United States under title 10 of the United States Code.</p>
                  <p>(f) The provisions of subsection (e) of this section shall also apply to any Wyoming resident whose primary occupation is that of a first responder when that person is called or ordered into federal service with a national guard unit in any state in the United States. The adjutant general shall promulgate rules and regulations for the administration of the payments authorized under subsection (e) of this section which rules shall provide a method for application for persons not serving in the Wyoming national guard and which shall establish a method for prorating payments where insufficient funds exist to make full payment on behalf of all qualifying persons.</p>

                  <p>(a) The employee's period of service in the uniformed services shall be counted as creditable service in the state retirement system in which he was a member for determining eligibility for death and survivor benefits and in the computation of benefits, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
                  <p>(i) The beneficiary of the death or survivor benefits shall provide payment of the unpaid portion of the contributions of the deceased member. The beneficiary may agree in writing to have the payment of the unpaid portion of the contributions of the deceased member deducted from the benefits over a period not to exceed four (4) years. The beneficiary may pay, in the alternative, the actuarial cost of such additional credit in a lump sum prior to the distribution of benefits;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If there is more than one (1) beneficiary a written agreement to pay the unpaid contributions of the deceased member shall be unanimous. In the event that a recipient is a minor child the legal guardian of the minor child may express consent for the minor child;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The board of trustees of every state retirement system shall adopt a written policy covering all beneficiaries' and survivors' rights to pay the required contributions in order to have the employee's military service computed in the computation of any death or survivor benefits payable under the state retirement system.</p>
                  <p>(b) If all of the conditions of subsection (a) of this section are satisfied the employer shall pay the employer contributions in a manner consistent with this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the beneficiary of the death or survivor benefits of the deceased member elects not to pay the employee contributions due the system on account for such service in the uniformed services credit, the computation of death and survivor benefits shall be based on the actual service of the member in the system prior to his call to service in the uniformed services. The death or survivor benefits provided for herein shall be due and payable upon the death of the member.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the application of any provision set forth in this section results in an unpaid actuarial cost to the retirement system, it shall be borne by the employers through reflection in the employer rate established by the state retirement system's actuarial committee.</p>

                  <p>(a) This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states that enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term "states" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all United States territorial possessions.</p>
                  <p>(b) The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster or emergency aspects of resource shortages.</p>
                  <p>(c) This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies for actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' national guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.</p>

                  <p>(a) Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies, which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.</p>
                  <p>(b) The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all provisions of this compact shall be understood.</p>
                  <p>(c) On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for homeland security will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.</p>

                  <p>(a) It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this section. In formulating the plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, or enemy attack;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Review party states' individual homeland security plans and develop a plan, which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries;</p>
                  <p>(v) Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.</p>
                  <p>(b) The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:</p>
                  <p>(i) A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including but not limited to fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services and search and rescue;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.</p>
                  <p>(c) There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned homeland security responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take the action necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for that state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights and privileges afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in an official capacity in the receiving state, whichever is longer.</p>
