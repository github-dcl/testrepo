                <p>No voluntary partial payment of a claim based on alleged liability for injury or property damage shall be construed as an admission of fault or liability, or as a waiver or release of claim by the person receiving payment. Such payment is not admissible as evidence in any action for the purpose of determining the amount of any judgment, with respect to the parties to the occurrence from which the claim arose. Upon settlement of the claim, the parties may make any agreement they desire in respect to all voluntary partial payments. After entry of judgment, any such payment shall be treated as a credit and deducted from the amount of the judgment. If after partial voluntary payments are made it is determined by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the payor is liable for an amount less than the voluntary payments already made, the payor has no right of action for the recovery of amounts by which the voluntary payments exceed the final judgment. No voluntary partial payments shall be construed to reduce the amount of damages which may be pleaded and proved in a court proceeding between the parties.</p>

                <p>(ii) "Claimant" means a natural person, including the personal representative of a deceased person, or any legal entity, including corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships or unincorporated associations, and includes a third party plaintiff and a counterclaiming defendant;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Defendant" means a party to the litigation against whom a claim for damages is asserted, and includes third party defendants. Where there is a counterclaim, the claimant against whom the counterclaim is asserted is also a defendant;</p>
                <p>(iv) "Fault" includes acts or omissions, determined to be a proximate cause of death or injury to person or property, that are in any measure negligent, or that subject an actor to strict tort or strict products liability, and includes breach of warranty, assumption of risk and misuse or alteration of a product;</p>
                <p>(v) "Injury to person or property," in addition to bodily injury, includes, without limitation, loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress, pain and suffering, disfigurement, physical or mental disability, loss of earnings or income, damage to reputation, loss of consortium, loss of profits and all other such claims and causes of action arising out of the fault of an actor;</p>
                <p>(vi) "Wrongful death" means that cause of action authorized by Wyoming statute to recover money damages when the death of a person is caused by the fault of an actor such as would have entitled the party injured to maintain an action to recover damages if death had not ensued.</p>
                <p>(b) Contributory fault shall not bar a recovery in an action by any claimant or the claimant's legal representative to recover damages for wrongful death or injury to person or property, if the contributory fault of the claimant is not more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fault of all actors. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of fault attributed to the claimant.</p>
                <p>(c) Whether or not the claimant is free of fault, the court shall:</p>
                <p>(i) If a jury trial:</p>
                <p>(A) Direct the jury to determine the total amount of damages sustained by the claimant without regard to the percentage of fault attributed to the claimant, and the percentage of fault attributable to each actor; and</p>
                <p>(B) Inform the jury of the consequences of its determination of the percentage of fault.</p>
                <p>(ii) If a trial before the court without jury, make special findings of fact, determining the total amount of damages sustained by the claimant without regard to the percentage of fault attributed to the claimant, and the percentage of fault attributable to each actor.</p>
                <p>(d) The court shall reduce the amount of damages determined under subsection (c) of this section in proportion to the percentage of fault attributed to the claimant and enter judgment against each defendant in the amount determined under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p>(e) Each defendant is liable only to the extent of that defendant's proportion of the total fault determined under paragraph (c)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) Any person who issues a check which is not paid because the check has been dishonored for any reason has thirty (30) days following the date of a written demand mailed to the drawer of the check by United States postal service certificate of mailing at the address shown on the check or his last known address or personally served pursuant to the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, to pay to the holder of the check the amount of the check and a collection fee not to exceed thirty dollars ($30.00). The demand shall state that the drawer is required to pay the value of the check and the collection fee demanded and shall state the collection fee provided for in this section.</p>
                <p>(b) Any person who fails to pay the amount of the check and the collection fee as set forth in subsection (a) of this section within thirty (30) days following the date of a written demand, mailed to or served on the drawer in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, is liable to the holder of the check for three (3) times the amount of the check, but in no case less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), a collection fee of thirty dollars ($30.00), and court costs.</p>
                <p>(c) In extraordinary cases, including cases in which the court determines that the party who wrote the check has raised dilatory or bad faith defenses, the court may award the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees.</p>
                <p>(d) Nothing in this section shall prevent the criminal prosecution of the person who issues the check. However, any payment made by the defendant to a victim pursuant to an order for restitution entered in a criminal case pursuant to W.S. 7-9-101 through 7-9-112 or 6-3-704(b), shall be set off against any judgment in favor of the victim in a civil action brought under this section arising out of the same facts or event.</p>
                <p>(e) A cause of action under this section may be brought in small claims court, if the amount of the demand does not exceed the jurisdiction of that court, or in any other appropriate court.</p>

If an affidavit is filed, the court shall order the dismissal of the claim against the certifying party, except as provided for in subsection (b) of this section. The affidavit shall be filed within the time required for filing an answer, if no answer is filed; and, in any event, at least twenty (20) days prior to trial. Any order of dismissal based on the affidavit shall not be entered within ten (10) days after the affidavit is filed.</p>

After the filing of an affidavit under this section, the party opposing the dismissal may have discovery with respect to the involvement or noninvolvement of the party filing the affidavit, provided the discovery is completed within sixty (60) days of the filing of the affidavit.</p>

                  <p>(a) The use and operation of a motor vehicle on any street or highway within Wyoming by any person upon whom service of process cannot be made within Wyoming either personally or by service upon a duly appointed resident agent is deemed an appointment of the secretary of state of Wyoming as the operator's lawful attorney upon whom may be served all legal processes in any proceeding against him, or his personal representative if he be deceased, due to damage or injury to person or property resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle on the streets or highways within this state. Such operation constitutes the operator's agreement that any process served in any action against him or his personal representative has the same legal force and validity as if served upon him or his personal representative personally within this state. Service shall be made by serving a copy of the process upon the secretary of state or by filing such copy in his office, together with payment of a fee of three dollars ($3.00). Within ten (10) days after the date of service, notice of such service and a copy of the process shall be served upon the defendant or his personal representative either personally or by certified mail addressed to the last known address of the defendant or his personal representative. The plaintiff shall file with the clerk of the court in which the action is brought an affidavit that he has complied with such requirement.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court in which the action is pending shall order such continuance as necessary to afford the defendant or his personal representative reasonable opportunity to defend the action. The fee of three dollars ($3.00) paid by the plaintiff to the secretary of state at the time of service of process shall be taxed as costs in the suit.</p>
                  <p>(c) The secretary of state shall keep a record of all processes served showing the date and hour of service and shall arrange and index the record to make it readily accessible and convenient for inspection. The district court of the county in which the cause of action arose or the district court of the county in which the plaintiff resides shall have jurisdiction over the action. The clerk of the district court in which the action is commenced may issue summons directed to the sheriff of Laramie county, Wyoming for service upon the secretary of state of Wyoming.</p>

                  <p>(a) A juror may not be excused for a trivial cause or for hardship or inconvenience to his business, but only when material injury or destruction to his property or property entrusted to him is threatened, or when his health or the sickness or death of a member of his family requires his absence. A person who has attained the age of seventy-two (72) years may be excused at his request. A person may be excused from jury duty when the care of that person's young children requires his absence. Any person who has served on a jury during a jury term shall, upon request, be excused from further jury service in that court for the remainder of that jury term and in the discretion of the court may be excused from jury service for the following jury term.</p>
                  <p>(b) For the purposes of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) A person has served on a jury during a jury term when he is summoned to serve and he has been selected as a juror in any court within the judicial district and has taken the oath required under W.S. 1-11-201;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A person has not served on a jury during a jury term if he is disqualified for that jury term pursuant to W.S. 1-11-102 or is discharged for that jury term pursuant to W.S. 1- 11-103.</p>

                  <p>If a person exempt from jury duty is summoned as a juror, he may submit a declaration under penalty of perjury stating his purported grounds for exemption. If the court determines that the declaration sufficiently demonstrates that the person is not required to serve as a juror pursuant to W.S. 1-11-103(a), the court shall discharge the person from serving as a trial juror for the jury term in which he was summoned. A person who is discharged under this section is not required to appear in court. Failure of any person who is exempt to submit a declaration under penalty of perjury is a waiver of his exemption, and he is required to appear upon the day for which the jury is summoned and serve as a juror the same as if he were not entitled to exemption unless otherwise excused by the court.</p>

                  <p>(vi) Before argument of the cause is begun, the court shall give such instructions of the law to the jury as may be necessary. The instructions shall be in writing, numbered and signed by the judge;</p>

                  <p>(a) When two (2) persons perish in the same calamity and it is not shown who died first and there are no particular circumstances from which it can be inferred, survivorship is presumed from the probabilities resulting from the strength, age and sex, according to the following rules:</p>
                  <p>(i) If both of those who have perished were under the age of fifteen (15) years, the older is presumed to have survived;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If both were of the age of sixty (60) years or older, the younger is presumed to have survived;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If one is under fifteen (15) years of age and the other is sixty (60) years of age or older, the former is presumed to have survived;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If both are fifteen (15) years of age or older and under sixty (60) years of age, and the sexes are different, the male is presumed to have survived. If the sexes are the same, the older will be presumed to have survived;</p>
                  <p>(v) If one is under the age of fifteen (15) years or is sixty (60) years of age or older, and the other is between those ages, the latter is presumed to have survived.</p>

                <p>If a nonresident of the state or a partnership suing in its company name brings an action, the plaintiff must furnish sufficient security for costs approved by the clerk. A surety's obligations are complete by his endorsing the summons or complaint. The surety is bound for the payment of all costs adjudged or taxed against the plaintiff in the court in which the action is brought or in any other court to which it may be carried, whether he obtains judgment or not. The nonresident plaintiff may deposit with the clerk of court as security for costs in the case such sum of money as the clerk deems sufficient for the purpose. Upon motion of the defendant, the court may require the deposit to be increased, that personal security be given or that the nonresident plaintiff pay all costs as fast as they accrue.</p>

                <p>(a) In other actions the court may award and tax costs and apportion them between the parties on the same or adverse sides as it deems right and equitable. When a civil case is settled too late for the clerk of court to advise the jury panel that the jurors should not appear on the date summoned the court may order that any or all parties reimburse the proper fund for the fees and mileage paid to the jurors and bailiffs for their appearance.</p>
                <p>(b) In civil actions for which an award of attorney's fees is authorized, the court in its discretion may award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party without requiring expert testimony. In exercising its discretion the court may consider the following factors:</p>
                <p>(i) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</p>
                <p>(ii) The likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment precluded other employment by the lawyer;</p>
                <p>(iii) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</p>
                <p>(iv) The amount involved and the results obtained;</p>
                <p>(v) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</p>
                <p>(vi) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</p>
                <p>(vii) The experience, reputation and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</p>
                <p>(viii) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>

                  <p>(i) The writ shall issue only upon written motion and pursuant to a written order of the court;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The court shall not direct the issuance of the writ without notice to the adverse party and an opportunity to be heard unless it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury will result to the plaintiff before notice can be served and a hearing had thereon. A finding by the court that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury shall be made only if the court finds the existence of either of the following circumstances:</p>
                  <p>(A) There is present danger that the property will be immediately disposed of, concealed, or placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court; or</p>

The order shall define the injury and state why the injury is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice. The order, and any writ issued pursuant thereto, shall expire within a time fixed by the court, not to exceed ten (10) days after issuance. Within the time fixed, the court may, after notice and hearing, order the writ continued in effect or the adverse party may consent that the writ may be extended for a longer period.

                  <p>(vii) Any notice required under this section shall be in a form and served in a manner as will expeditiously give the adverse party actual notice of the proceeding, all as directed by the court;</p>
                  <p>(viii) In the event that property has been seized by the sheriff pursuant to the issuance of a writ without notice, the property shall be retained by him subject to the order of the court.</p>

                  <p>(a) of this section is given is not satisfied with the amount of the bond or the sufficiency of the sureties, he may, within five (5) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after the receipt of a copy of the bond, serve upon the party giving the bond a notice that the party for whose benefit the bond is given objects to the amount of the bond or the sufficiency of the sureties. If the party for whose benefit the bond is given fails to object within the time allowed he is deemed to have waived all objection to the amount of bond and the sufficiency of the sureties.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notice of objections to the amount of bond and the sufficiency of sureties as provided in subsection (b) of this section shall be filed in the form of a motion for hearing on objections to the bond. Upon demand of the objecting party, each surety shall appear at the hearing of the motion and be subject to examination as to the surety's pecuniary responsibility or the validity of the execution of the bond. Upon hearing, the court shall approve or reject the bond as filed or require any amended, substitute or additional bond as the circumstances warrant. If the court rejects the bond or if the plaintiff fails within the time allowed to file any amended, substitute or additional bond required by the court, any property seized under the writ shall be returned to the defendant.</p>
                  <p>(d) The bond required by this section shall, in addition to other requirements, provide that each surety is subject to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as the agent of the surety upon whom any papers affecting the liability of the surety on the bond may be served, and that the liability of the surety may be enforced on motion and upon notice as the court may require without the necessity of an independent action.</p>

                  <p>(a) At any time, either before or after the execution of a writ of attachment, replevin or garnishment, the defendant may obtain a release of any property or a discharge of the writ as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) To secure a discharge of the attachment or garnishment the defendant shall furnish a bond, with sufficient sureties, in a sum of not less than double the amount claimed by the plaintiff, but not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) in amount. The conditions of the bond shall be to the effect that if the plaintiff recovers judgment, the defendant will pay the judgment together with interest and all costs assessed against him, not exceeding the sum specified in the bond;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To secure a release of property seized under a writ of attachment, replevin or garnishment, the defendant shall furnish a bond, with sufficient sureties, in a sum not less than the value of the property to be released, but in no case in an amount greater than necessary to obtain a discharge of the writ under paragraph (i) of this subsection. The conditions of the bond shall be to the effect that if the plaintiff recovers judgment, the defendant will pay the judgment, together with interest and all costs assessed against him, not exceeding the sum specified in the bond.</p>
                  <p>(b) The bond required by subsection (a) of this section shall be delivered to the sheriff at or before the time of service of the writ of attachment, replevin or garnishment. If the release or discharge is sought after the writ has been executed or the property seized, the defendant shall apply to the court, upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff, for an order releasing the property or discharging the writ.</p>
                  <p>(c) The bond required by subsection (a) of this section shall be filed with the court, and a copy of the bond served upon the plaintiff. Within five (5) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after the plaintiff is served with notice of the filing of the bond required by subsection (a) of this section the plaintiff may object to the amount of the bond or the sufficiency of defendant's sureties, by serving upon the defendant and filing with the court a motion for hearing on objection to bond.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon demand of the plaintiff, each surety shall appear at the hearing requested under subsection (c) of this section, and be subject to examination as to the surety's pecuniary responsibility or the validity of the execution of the bond. Upon hearing, the court shall approve or reject the bond as filed or require any amended, substitute or additional bond as the circumstances warrant.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon a discharge of the writ or release of the property under this section, all of the property released, if not sold, and the proceeds of any sale of the property, shall be delivered to the defendant. The release or discharge by the court shall not be effective until the time for plaintiff to object to the amount of the bond or the sufficiency of the defendant's sureties has expired.</p>
                  <p>(f) The bond required by this section shall, in addition to other requirements, provide that each surety is subject to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as his agent upon whom any papers affecting the liability of the surety on the bond may be served, and that his liability may be enforced on motion and upon notice as the court may require without the necessity of an independent action.</p>

                  <p>(a) Within five (5) days after the court receives the person's written request for a hearing, a person whose property is attached or whose property is in the possession of another person and is attached or garnished, and against whom no judgment has been entered, is entitled to a hearing on the attaching party's right to the property. The sheriff shall mail to the person a copy of the order of attachment or writ of garnishment and notice of the right to a hearing under this section, at the time the order of attachment is executed or the writ of garnishment is served on the garnishee. The papers shall be sent by first class United States mail with the postage prepaid and the envelopes furnished and properly addressed by the plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>(b) The notice required by this section shall inform the person of his right to request a hearing. The notice shall inform him that certain benefits and property cannot be taken to pay a debt and shall list the exempted benefits and property set forth in paragraphs (i) through (x) of this subsection. The notice shall also include a form for requesting a hearing and instructions that if the person believes he is entitled to retain or recover the property because it is exempt, or for any other reason, he should sign the form requesting a hearing and return or mail the form to the office of the clerk of court within ten (10) days after the date the notice was mailed to him. The request for hearing form shall set forth the following exemptions and provide a place for the person to designate which exemptions he claims:</p>
                  <p>(i) Social security benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 407 and supplemental security income;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Veteran's benefits;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Black lung benefits;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) payments;</p>
                  <p>(v) Federal civil service and state retirement system benefits as provided in 5 U.S.C. 8346 and W.S. 9-3-426, 9-3-620, 9-3-712 and 15-5-313;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Worker's compensation benefits;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Unemployment compensation benefits;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Earnings from personal services as defined by W.S. 1-15-102(a)(vi);</p>
                  <p>(ix) Homestead, personal articles and articles used for carrying on a trade or business to the extent provided by W.S. 1-20-101 through 1-20-111;</p>
                  <p>(x) Other exemptions as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(c) The notice shall state that there may be additional exemptions not listed which may be applicable. Failure by the person to claim an exemption on the request for hearing form does not preclude him from claiming other exemptions or defenses at a hearing on the matter. If a person fails to make a written request for a hearing and claim exemptions pursuant to this section within ten (10) days after the date the notice was mailed to him, the notice shall state he may waive or lose his rights under this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) The sheriff may withhold execution of the prejudgment writ of attachment or garnishment until the plaintiff either provides the person's last known address or a statement that the plaintiff has no knowledge of the person's last known address. The sheriff shall have no duty under this section if the plaintiff provides a statement that the plaintiff has no knowledge of the defendant's address.</p>
                  <p>(e) In the case of a post judgment writ of garnishment, procedures for notice and hearing on a claim of exemptions shall be as provided by W.S. 1-15-501 through 1-15-511 or 1-17-102.</p>

If there is no occupant of the property, a copy of the writ, together with the description and notice, shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the property. When filed, the county clerk shall index the attachment in the names of the defendant and of the person in whose name the real property is held;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Growing crops, which until severed, shall be deemed personal property not capable of manual delivery, or any interest therein belonging to the defendant, and growing upon real property held in the name of any other person, shall be attached in the same manner as crops growing upon real property held in the name of the defendant are attached under paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection. The notice of attachment shall state that the crops therein described or any interest of the defendant therein, held by, or standing upon the records of the county in the name of such other person, naming him, are attached pursuant to the writ.

The order shall be made only upon notice to the adverse party if the party has been personally served or has entered an appearance in the action.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>1-15-408. Garnishment of earnings for personal services.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A writ of post judgment garnishment attaching earnings for personal services shall attach that portion of the defendant's accrued and unpaid disposable earnings, specified in subsection (b) of this section. The writ shall direct the garnishee to withhold from the defendant's accrued disposable earnings the amount attached pursuant to the writ and to pay the exempted amount to the defendant at the time his earnings are normally paid. A defendant's disposable earnings shall remain exempt to the extent provided in subsection (b) of this section if the earnings were deposited in the defendant's account with a financial institution within twenty (20) calendar days prior to service of a writ of garnishment against the defendant's account with the financial institution, on the day of service of the writ or within ten (10) business days after service of the writ. This subsection does not create any obligation on the part of a financial institution to conduct an investigation of the defendant's account or otherwise make any determination about a judgment creditor's rights to funds in the account other than the financial institution's obligation to file with the court and serve on the defendant an answer to the writ of garnishment. A judgment creditor may request that the court issue writs of garnishment to a defendant's employer and the defendant's financial institution at the same time; provided, however, that should the judgment creditor successfully garnish earnings as shown on a defendant's pay advice, then the remaining proceeds from such pay advice deposited into an account with a financial institution shall be entirely exempt from execution, notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section. Earnings for personal services shall be deemed to accrue on the last day of the period in which they were earned or to which they relate.</p>
                  <p>If the writ is served before or on the date the defendant's earnings accrue and before the same have been paid to the defendant, the writ shall be deemed to have been served at the time the periodic earnings accrue. If more than one (1) writ is served, the writ first served shall have priority.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, an income withholding order for child support obtained pursuant to W.S. 20-6-201 through 20-6-222 shall have priority over any other garnishment.</p>
                  <p>(b) The maximum portion of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual which are subject to garnishment is the lesser of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Twenty-five percent (25%) of defendant's disposable earnings for that week; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The amount by which defendant's aggregate disposable earnings computed for that week exceeds thirty (30) times the federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1), in effect at the time the earnings are payable, or, in case of earnings for any pay period other than a week, any equivalent multiple thereof prescribed by the administrator of the Wyoming Uniform Consumer Credit Code in the manner provided by W.S. 40-14-505(b)(iii).</p>
                  <p>(c) Unless a garnishee is specifically informed by affidavit of the plaintiff that the defendant has other periodic earnings from sources other than from the garnishee and the amount thereof, the garnishee shall treat the defendant's earnings becoming due from the garnishee as the defendant's entire aggregate earnings for the purpose of computing the sum attached by the garnishment.</p>

                  <p>(a) The parties to the principal action who fail to reply to the answer of the garnishee shall be deemed to have accepted it as correct. If both parties to the principal action have accepted the answer, an appropriate judgment shall be entered. If the answer shows that the garnishment has attached personal property of any kind in the possession or under the control of the garnishee which belongs to and is due the defendant, the court shall enter judgment that the garnishee deliver the personal property to the sheriff. If the plaintiff has already recovered, or subsequently recovers judgment against the defendant in the action, the personal property or as much as may be necessary shall be sold upon execution and the proceeds applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment, together with the costs of the action and proceedings. Any surplus of the personal property or the proceeds thereof shall be returned to the defendant.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the answer shows that the garnishee is indebted to the defendant, and if the plaintiff has recovered, or subsequently recovers judgment against the defendant in the action, the court shall also enter judgment in favor of the defendant for the use of the plaintiff against the garnishee. The judgment shall be the amount attached as shown in the answer but shall not be for a greater sum than is necessary to satisfy the judgment against the defendant, together with costs. In no event shall the garnishee be chargeable with costs except under the provisions of W.S. 1-15-412 and 1-15-414.</p>

                  <p>If the garnishee has been duly served with a writ of prejudgment or post judgment garnishment and fails to answer as required by W.S. 1-15-407, the plaintiff may enter the default of the garnishee and proceed to prove the liability of the garnishee. The garnishee may be ordered to appear before the court or a master appointed by the court and be examined in the same manner as persons are examined under the discovery provisions of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure. The court may make provision for witness fees and mileage as is just, provided that if any garnishee has willfully failed to file any required answer, he may be required to pay the costs of any proceeding taken for the purpose of obtaining the information required to be furnished in the answer. Judgment shall be entered upon the evidence to the same effect as if the garnishee had answered. Costs shall be awarded to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.</p>

                  <p>(b) If the answer of the garnishee discloses that any person other than the defendant claims the indebtedness or property in his hands, the court may on motion order that the claimant be interpleaded as a defendant to the garnishee action. Notice in such form as the court shall direct, together with a copy of the order, shall be served upon the third-party claimant in the manner required for the service of a summons. The garnishee may pay or deliver to the court the indebtedness or property, which shall be a complete discharge from all liability to any party for the amount paid or property delivered. The third-party claimant shall be deemed a defendant to the garnishee action and shall answer within ten (10) days, setting forth his claim or defense.

                  <p>(a) In addition to garnishment proceedings otherwise available under the laws of this state, in any case in which a money judgment is obtained in a court of competent jurisdiction the judgment creditor or his assignees shall be entitled, in accordance with this article, to have the clerk of the court issue a writ for continuing garnishment against any garnishee who is an employer of the judgment debtor. Issuance of a writ of execution is not a prerequisite to issuance of a writ of continuing garnishment. To the extent that the earnings are not exempt from garnishment, the garnishment shall be a lien and continuing levy upon the earnings due or to become due to the judgment debtor at the time the writ of continuing garnishment is served on the garnishee.</p>
                  <p>(b) Subject to the provisions of W.S. 1-15-504, garnishment pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be a lien and continuing levy against said earnings due until such time as the employment relationship is terminated, the underlying judgment is vacated, modified or satisfied in full, the writ is dismissed, or ninety (90) days have expired since service of the writ, whichever is sooner. A continuing garnishment may be suspended for a specified period of time by the judgment creditor upon agreement with the judgment debtor. The agreement shall be in writing and filed by the judgment creditor with the clerk of the court in which the judgment was entered and a copy of the agreement shall be delivered by the judgment creditor to the garnishee.</p>
                  <p>(c) Continuing garnishment pursuant to this article shall apply only to proceedings against the earnings of a judgment debtor who is a natural person.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to the provisions of W.S. 1-15-504, any earnings owed by the garnishee to the judgment debtor at the time of service of the writ of continuing garnishment upon the garnishee and all earnings accruing from the garnishee to the judgment debtor from the date of service up to and including the ninetieth day thereafter is subject to the process of continuing garnishment.</p>

                  <p>(a) Only one (1) writ of continuing garnishment against earnings due the judgment debtor shall be satisfied at one (1) time. When more than one (1) writ of continuing garnishment has been issued against earnings due the same judgment debtor, they shall be satisfied in the order of service on the garnishee. When a writ of continuing garnishment is served upon a garnishee during the effective period of a prior writ of continuing garnishment, service of the subsequent writ shall be deemed effective from the time the liens of all prior writs have terminated. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a lien and continuing levy obtained pursuant to this article shall have priority over any subsequent garnishment lien or wage attachment. In any civil action, a judgment creditor shall serve no more than one (1) writ of continuing garnishment upon any one (1) garnishee for the same judgment debtor during any ninety (90) day period.</p>
                  <p>(b) Where a continuing garnishment has been suspended for a specific period of time by agreement of the parties pursuant to W.S. 1-15-502(b), the suspended continuing garnishment shall have priority over any writ of garnishment or continuing garnishment served on the garnishee after the suspension has expired. No suspension shall extend the running of the ninety (90) day effective period of the writ nor otherwise affect priorities.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an income withholding order for child support obtained pursuant to W.S. 20-6-201 through 20-6-222 shall have priority over any other continuing garnishment. If an income withholding order is served during the effective period of a writ of continuing garnishment, the effective period shall be tolled and all priorities preserved until the termination of the income withholding order.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any writ of garnishment or continuing garnishment served upon a garnishee while any previous writ of continuing garnishment is still in effect shall be answered by the garnishee with a statement that he has been served previously with one (1) or more writs of continuing garnishment against earnings due the judgment debtor and specifying the date on which all such liens are expected to terminate.</p>
                  <p>(e) Upon the termination of a lien and continuing levy obtained pursuant to this article, any other writ of garnishment or continuing garnishment which has been issued or which is issued subsequently against earnings due the judgment debtor shall have priority in the order of service on the garnishee. The person who serves a writ of continuing garnishment on a garnishee shall note the date and time of the service.</p>

                  <p>(b) Compliance with this section and W.S. 1-15-505 by the judgment creditor shall be deemed to give sufficient notice to the judgment debtor of the continuing garnishment proceedings against him, and no further notice shall be required under this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) The garnishee shall file with the court a verified answer to the writ of continuing garnishment no later than ten (10) days following the date the judgment debtor receives earnings for the first pay period affected by the writ, or forty (40) days following the date the writ was served upon the garnishee, whichever is earlier.

                  <p>(iii) The dates on which the judgment debtor will be paid during the ninety (90) day effective period of the writ;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The amount of the judgment debtor's regular gross pay and an itemization of deductions regularly withheld from the judgment debtor's gross pay by the garnishee; and</p>
                  <p>(v) Whether any other outstanding writ of continuing garnishment or income withholding order for child support relating to the judgment debtor has been served on the garnishee and if so the date on which each writ or order is expected to terminate.</p>

                  <p>When a judgment, including judgments rendered by a circuit court, a transcript of which has been filed in the district court for execution, becomes dormant, it may be revived by the allowance of the court of a motion for revival or by a conditional order of the court that the action be revived. If the order of revival is made by consent of the parties, the action shall be revived. If the order is not made by consent, the order shall be served on the adverse party. When either party to the dormant judgment, his agent or attorney, makes affidavit showing that the adverse party is a nonresident of the state and that the judgment remains unsatisfied in whole or in part and the amount owing thereon, service may be made by publication as in other cases. If sufficient cause is not shown to the contrary, the judgment shall stand revived for the amount which the court finds to be due and unsatisfied thereon. The lien of the judgment for the amount due shall be revived and shall operate from the time of the entry of the conditional order or the filing of the motion.</p>

                  <p>(a) The provisions of this act may not be waived by any payee.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any transfer agreement entered into on or after July 1, 2006 by a payee who resides in this state shall provide that disputes under the transfer agreement, including any claim that the payee has breached the agreement, shall be determined in and under the laws of this state. No transfer agreement shall authorize the transferee or any other party to confess judgment or consent to entry of judgment against the payee.</p>
                  <p>(c) No transfer of structured settlement payment rights shall extend to any payments that are life-contingent unless, prior to the date on which the payee signs the transfer agreement, the transferee has established and has agreed to maintain procedures reasonably satisfactory to the annuity issuer and the structured settlement obligor for:</p>
                  <p>(i) Periodically confirming the payee's survival; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Giving the annuity issuer and the structured settlement obligor prompt written notice in the event of the payee's death.</p>

                  <p>(e) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to authorize any transfer of structured settlement payment rights in contravention of any law or to imply that any transfer under a transfer agreement entered into prior to July 1, 2006 is valid or invalid.</p>
                  <p>(f) Compliance with the requirements of W.S. 1-16-603 and fulfillment of the conditions set forth in W.S. 1-16-604 shall be solely the responsibility of the transferee in any transfer of structured settlement payment rights, and neither the structured settlement obligor nor the annuity issuer shall bear any responsibility for, or any liability arising from, noncompliance with the requirements of W.S. 1-16-603 or failure to fulfill the conditions set forth in W.S. 1-16-604.</p>

                  <p>In order for a foreign judgment to have the same effect as a judgment of a district court of this state, a copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with an act of Congress or the statutes of this state shall be filed in the office of the clerk of any district court and any county clerk of this state. The clerk of court shall treat the foreign judgment as a judgment of the district court of this state notwithstanding the amount of the judgment or that the action giving rise to the judgment, if initiated in this state, would be within the jurisdiction of a minor court. A judgment so filed has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating or staying as a judgment of a district court of this state and may be so enforced or satisfied.</p>

                <p>(iii) The foreclosing mortgagee, judgment creditor, other foreclosing lienor or an authorized agent of the foreclosing party is present at the sale or has previously waived to the sheriff conducting the sale the right to appear and bid at the sale. The sheriff conducting the sale shall not be considered to be the authorized agent of the foreclosing party unless the foreclosing party has given the sheriff a specified opening bid to be presented by the sheriff on behalf of the foreclosing party and the sheriff actually presents the opening bid.

The notice shall state "The property being foreclosed upon may be subject to other liens and encumbrances that will not be extinguished at the sale and any prospective purchaser should research the status of title before submitting a bid." If any officer sells any lands or tenements by virtue of any execution or decree, otherwise than as provided, the officer so offending shall forfeit and pay five hundred dollars ($500.00) for every offense, to be recovered with costs in any court of record in this state by the person whose lands were advertised and sold.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as provided with respect to agricultural real estate, it is lawful for any person, his heirs, executors, administrators, assigns or guarantors whose real property has been sold by virtue of an execution, decree of foreclosure, or foreclosure by advertisement and sale within three (3) months from the date of sale, to redeem the real estate by paying to the purchaser, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, or to the sheriff or other officer who sold the property, for the benefit of the purchaser, the amount of the purchase price or the amount given or bid if purchased by the execution creditor or by the mortgagee under a mortgage, together with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of sale plus the amount of any assessments or taxes and the amount due on any prior lien which the purchaser paid after the purchase, with interest. On payment of this amount the sale and certificate granted are void and the sheriff or other officer shall issue a certificate of redemption.</p>
                <p>(b) In the case of any mortgage upon one (1) or more parcels of real estate any or all of which were agricultural real estate on the date of execution of the mortgage as stated in the mortgage, the period within which the owner, his heirs, executors, administrators, assigns or guarantors may redeem the premises sold is twelve (12) months from the date of the sale.</p>
                <p>(c) The term "agricultural real estate" means any single parcel of land in excess of eighty (80) acres lying outside the exterior boundaries of any incorporated city, town or recorded subdivision or any property that is used substantially for agricultural purposes, which, if combined with other property in the mortgage that is used substantially for agricultural purposes, equals eighty (80) acres or more in aggregate. If the mortgage recites that the real estate involved is agricultural real estate, it is presumed the parties to the mortgage, their heirs, executors, administrators, assigns, guarantors or successors in interest have agreed to and are bound by all the provisions of law relative to the twelve (12) month right of redemption provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>1-18-104. Redemption by judgment creditors and others; manner prescribed; subsequent redemptions; possession, rents and profits, common carriers excepted.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If no redemption is made within the redemption period provided in W.S. 1-18-103, any judgment creditor of the person whose real estate has been sold, or any grantee or mortgagee of the real estate or person holding a lien on the real estate sold is entitled to redeem the same on or before the thirtieth day after the expiration of the applicable redemption period provided in W.S. 1-18-103, by complying with subsections (b) and</p>
                <p>(c) of this section.</p>
                <p>(b) The redemptioner shall pay to the purchaser or to the officer conducting the sale, either an amount agreed upon by the purchaser and the redemptioner, or the amount bid with interest at ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of sale, and the amount of any assessments or taxes and the amount due on any prior lien which the purchaser may have paid after the purchase, with interest. If the purchaser also has a lien prior to that of the redemptioner, the redemptioner shall also pay the amount of the lien with interest.</p>
                <p>(c) The redemptioner must produce for the purchaser from whom redemption is sought or for the officer who conducted the sale:</p>
                <p>(i) A copy of the judgment under which the right of redemption is claimed, duly certified by the clerk of the court in which the judgment was entered, or if redemption is sought under a mortgage or other lien, a copy of the mortgage or other lien certified by the clerk of the county; or</p>
                <p>(ii) A copy of any assignment necessary to establish the claim; and</p>
                <p>(iii) An affidavit by himself or his agent showing the amount actually unpaid and due on the lien.</p>
                <p>(d) If the property is redeemed, another redemptioner may within thirty (30) days from the last redemption again redeem from the last redemptioner by paying the amount of the last redemption together with interest at ten percent (10%) per annum from the date thereof, and the amount of any assessment or taxes which the last redemptioner may have paid and the amount of any lien held by the last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest. The property may again, and as often as any redemptioner desires, be redeemed from any previous redemption within thirty (30) days from the last redemption. If no redemption is made within thirty (30) days after the applicable redemption period provided in W.S. 1-18-103, the purchaser or his assignee is entitled to a sheriff's deed to the property, or if so redeemed, whenever thirty (30) days has elapsed and no other redemption has been made, the last redemptioner or his assignee is entitled to a sheriff's deed.</p>
                <p>(e) The execution debtor in case of a sale on execution, and the mortgagor or owner in case of a mortgage foreclosure, is entitled to possession of the lands sold and to the rents and profits for a period of three (3) months after the sale unless the property is agricultural property in which case the entitlement to possession of the lands sold and to the rents and profits shall be for a period of twelve (12) months after the sale. At the expiration of three (3) months from sale of nonagricultural land and twelve (12) months from sale of agricultural land, the purchaser is entitled to possession and to the rents and profits of the lands until redemption is made from him, and each redemptioner until another redemption is made is likewise entitled to possession and to the rents and profits.</p>
                <p>(f) The parties to a mortgage may provide that the mortgagee is entitled to a receiver or to the rents and profits upon default, or upon the date of sale or at any time agreed upon. A court may appoint a receiver or award the rents and profits to the person entitled thereto for the prevention of waste, or the preservation of the property, or for any equitable cause.</p>
                <p>(g) This section does not apply when real and personal property of a common carrier is sold in its entirety at a judicial sale pursuant to an order of court. In such case, property may be sold without right of redemption unless otherwise directed by the order of sale.</p>

                <p>(a) When a mortgage is foreclosed a sale of the premises shall be ordered. The decree directing the sale is sufficient warrant for the sheriff or other officer to proceed to advertise and conduct the sale. An order of sale issued by the clerk of court or an appraisement of the real property to be sold is not necessary. When the premises to be sold are in one (1) or more tracts, the court may direct the officer who makes the sale to subdivide and sell the same in parcels, or to sell any one (1) of the tracts as a whole.</p>
                <p>(b) Upon the sale of the premises, a purchaser shall have a limited right of entry to ensure the property does not significantly deteriorate during the full redemption period. As used in this subsection, "limited right of entry" means entrance into the premises which is not occupied by a legal inhabitant.</p>

                <p>(a) For purposes of this section:</p>
                <p>(i) "Omitted party" means any person who:</p>
                <p>(A) Subsequent to the recording of a mortgage, deed of trust or other lien instrument pursuant to which a foreclosure sale has been conducted, has either acquired a record interest in the property subject to a mortgage foreclosure, deed of trust or execution sale, or has obtained a valid possessory interest and is in actual possession of the property; and</p>
                <p>(B) Is not included as a party defendant in a judicial foreclosure action or, if included, is entitled to notice, but was not served with process, or was not mailed notice of the execution sale or is not notified pursuant to W.S. 34-4-104 of a mortgage foreclosure sale.</p>
                <p>(ii) "Interested person" means any holder of a certificate of purchase or certificate of redemption issued pursuant to W.S. 1-18-102 and 1-18-106 or any owner of the property by virtue of a sheriff's or public trustee's deed or person claiming through such owner.</p>
                <p>(b) The interest of an omitted party in the property which is the subject of a mortgage foreclosure, execution or sheriff's or trustee's sale may be terminated in a civil action commenced by any interested person if the omitted party is afforded rights of redemption upon terms as the district court for the district in which the property is located may deem just under the circumstances, which terms shall not, however, be more favorable than the person's statutory rights had the person been provided notice of the sale.</p>
                <p>(c) For purposes of this section, the mortgage, judgment or other lien which is the subject of the sale shall not be extinguished by merger with the title to the property acquired upon issuance and delivery of the sheriff's deed until the interest of any omitted party has been terminated as provided in subsection (b) of this section or by operation of law.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>1-18-115. Rescission of foreclosure sale.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale may be rescinded in accordance with this section at any time after the sale but before the sheriff's deed has been recorded.</p>
                <p>(b) If the purchaser at the foreclosure sale was the foreclosing mortgagee, then the foreclosing mortgagee may rescind the sale for any reason by executing and recording a notice of foreclosure sale rescission in the office of the county clerk of the county where the real estate is located.</p>
                <p>(c) If the purchaser at the foreclosure sale was not the foreclosing mortgagee, then the foreclosing mortgagee and the certificate holder may agree to rescind the foreclosure sale for any reason. In order to rescind such a foreclosure sale, the foreclosing mortgagee shall refund to the certificate holder either an amount agreed upon by the foreclosing mortgagee and the certificate holder, or the foreclosure sale bid amount plus ten percent (10%) interest per annum, calculated daily. In addition, both the foreclosing mortgagee and the certificate holder shall execute a notice of foreclosure sale rescission which shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county where the real estate is located.</p>
                <p>(d) If the purchaser at the foreclosure sale was not the foreclosing mortgagee, and the certificate holder will not agree to rescind the foreclosure sale, then the foreclosing mortgagee may still rescind the sale if the statutory requirements for the foreclosure sale were not fulfilled or if the foreclosure sale did not comply with applicable federal or state law. In order to rescind such a foreclosure sale, the foreclosing mortgagee shall refund to the certificate holder the purchase price, plus ten percent (10%) interest per annum, calculated daily, and the foreclosing mortgagee shall execute and record a notice of foreclosure sale rescission in the office of the county clerk of the county where the real estate is located which shall recite that the foreclosure sale is being rescinded pursuant to this subsection. The refund of the certificate holder's bid amount, plus interest, shall be the certificate holder's only remedy notwithstanding any other provision of law.</p>
                <p>(e) Upon recording a notice of foreclosure sale rescission:</p>
                <p>(i) The mortgage and power of sale which are the subject of the rescinded sale are revived and the mortgage may be properly foreclosed in a subsequent foreclosure sale in compliance with applicable law, and all junior liens and rights of junior lienholders are revived with the same lien priority as if no foreclosure sale had taken place;</p>
                <p>(ii) The certificate of sale is rendered null and void as if no foreclosure sale had taken place; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The mortgagor's indebtedness to the foreclosing mortgagee and all evidence thereof are revived as of the date of the foreclosure sale and as if no certificate of sale had been issued, or as otherwise agreed to by the mortgagor and mortgagee.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the action is not continued, the place of trial changed or if neither party demands a jury, upon the return day of the summons the circuit court shall try the action. If the circuit court concludes that the complaint is not true, the court shall enter judgment against the plaintiff for costs. If the court finds the complaint true, it shall render a general judgment in favor of the plaintiff for restitution of the premises and costs. If the court finds the complaint true in part, it shall render judgment for restitution of that part only and the costs shall be taxed as deemed equitable.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the case is one based on failure to pay rent, the court shall further find the amount of rent due and payable at the time of the hearing, together with the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties in relation to the amount and time of payment of rent. If the trial is by jury the verdict shall contain a finding of these facts and the court shall recite such findings in the docket entry of proceedings. The court, upon these findings, in addition to entering judgment for the plaintiff to have restitution, shall render judgment in accordance with the findings for the amount of rent found due, together with costs and attorney's fees as provided by the lease, and shall issue execution separate from the writ of restitution for the rent found due and costs as in other actions.</p>

                  <p>(i) Not rent the residential rental unit unless it is reasonably safe, sanitary and fit for human occupancy;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Maintain common areas of the residential rental unit in a sanitary and reasonably safe condition;</p>

                  <p>(d) The owner may refuse to correct the condition of the residential rental unit and terminate the rental agreement if the costs of repairs exceeds an amount which would be reasonable in light of the rent charged, the nature of the rental property or rental agreement.

                  <p>(a) The remedies set forth in this section are available to a renter in compliance with all provisions of W.S. 1-21-1204 and 1-21-1205 when the rental agreement has not been lawfully terminated pursuant to W.S. 1-21-1203(d).</p>
                  <p>(b) If a reasonable time has elapsed after the renter has served written notice on the owner under W.S. 1-21-1203 and the owner has failed to respond or to correct the condition described in the notice, the renter may cause a "notice to repair or correct condition" to be prepared and served on the owner by certified mail or in the manner specified by W.S. 1-21-1003. This notice shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Recite the previous notice served under W.S. 1-21-1203(b);</p>
                  <p>(ii) State the number of days that have elapsed since the notice was served and that under the circumstances the period of time constitutes the reasonable time allowed under W.S. 1-21-1203(b);</p>
                  <p>(iii) State the conditions included in the previous notice which have not been corrected;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Demand that the uncorrected conditions be corrected; and</p>
                  <p>(v) State that if the owner fails to commence reasonable corrective action within three (3) days he will seek redress in the courts.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the owner has not corrected or used due diligence to correct the conditions following notice under this section, or if the owner has notified the renter that the claim is disputed, the renter may commence a civil action in circuit court. The court shall endorse on the summons the number of days within which the owner is required to appear and defend the action, which shall not be less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) days from the date of service. Upon a showing of an unreasonable refusal to correct or the failure to use due diligence to correct a condition described in this article, the renter may be awarded costs, damages and affirmative relief as determined by the court. Damages awarded to the renter may include rent improperly retained or collected. Affirmative relief may include a declaration terminating the rental agreement, or an order directing the owner to make reasonable repairs.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the court terminates the rental agreement pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the renter is entitled to receive a refund of the balance of the rent and the deposit on the rental unit within thirty (30) days of the date the agreement is ordered terminated. The renter shall be required to vacate the rental unit no sooner than ten (10) days nor later than twenty (20) days after termination of the rental agreement by a court.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon termination of the rental agreement, property or money held as a deposit may be applied by the owner or his agent to the payment of accrued rent, damages to the residential rental unit beyond reasonable wear and tear, the cost to clean the unit to the condition at the beginning of the rental agreement and to other costs provided by any contract. The balance of any deposit and prepaid rent and a written itemization of any deductions from the deposit together with reasons therefor, shall be delivered or mailed without interest to the renter within thirty (30) days after termination of the rental agreement or within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the renter's new mailing address, whichever is later. If there is damage to the residential rental unit, this period shall be extended by thirty (30) days. The renter shall within thirty (30) days of termination of the rental agreement, notify the owner or designated agent of the location where payment and notice may be made or mailed.</p>
                  <p>(b) After termination of the rental agreement, property or money held and separately identified as a utilities deposit shall be refunded by the owner to the renter within ten (10) days of a satisfactory showing that all utility charges incurred by the renter have been paid. Absent such showing within forty- five (45) days of termination, the owner shall within fifteen (15) days thereafter, apply the utilities deposit to the outstanding utility debt incurred by the renter. Any refund due to the renter shall be paid within seven (7) days after the utility deposit has been applied to the renter's utility debt, or within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the renter's new mailing address, whichever is later.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the owner of a residential rental unit or his agent unreasonably fails to comply with subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the renter may recover the full deposit and court costs. In an action by a renter pursuant to this section, if the owner is the prevailing party and the court finds the renter acted unreasonably in bringing the action, the owner may be awarded court costs in addition to any other relief available.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon regaining lawful possession of the rental unit following termination of the rental agreement, the owner may immediately dispose of any trash or property the owner reasonably believes to be hazardous, perishable or valueless and abandoned. Any property remaining within the rental unit after termination of the rental agreement shall be presumed to be both valueless and abandoned. Any valuable property may be removed from the residential rental unit and shall thereafter be disposed of as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The owner shall provide written notice to the renter in accordance with this paragraph, describing the property claimed to be abandoned and stating that the property shall be disposed of after seven (7) days from the date of service of the notice if the renter or his agent does not, within the seven (7) day period, take possession of the property or notify the owner in writing of the renter's intent to take possession of the property. The notice provided by the owner under this paragraph shall be deemed served:</p>
                  <p>(A) On the date the notice is mailed by certified mail to the renter at an address furnished to the owner by the renter in writing specifically for this purpose;</p>
                  <p>(B) On the date notice is served on the renter in accordance with Rule 4 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure provided a copy of the written notice is delivered to the individual renter personally; or</p>
                  <p>(C) On the date the notice is published in a newspaper published in the county or widely circulated in the county where the residential rental unit is located.</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the owner does not receive a written response from the renter within seven (7) days after service of notice under paragraph (i) of this subsection, the property shall be conclusively deemed abandoned and the owner may retain or dispose of the property;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the renter responds in writing to the owner on or before seven (7) days after service of notice under paragraph (i) of this subsection that he intends to take possession of the property, the property shall be held for an additional period of seven (7) days after the written response is received. If the renter fails to take possession of the property within the additional fifteen (15) day period, the property shall be conclusively deemed abandoned and the owner may retain or dispose of the property.</p>
                  <p>(b) The owner is entitled to payment of storage costs for the period the property remains in safekeeping plus the cost of removal of the property to the place of storage. An owner shall be allowed reasonable storage costs if he stores the property himself or actual storage costs if the property is stored commercially. Payment of storage costs shall be made before the renter removes the property.</p>
                  <p>(c) The owner is not responsible for any loss to the renter resulting from storage.</p>

                  <p>(a) In any action brought by a landlord against a tenant to recover rent for breach of lease, the tenant shall have an affirmative defense and not be liable for rent for the period after which a tenant vacates the premises owned by the landlord and covered by the lease, if by a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) At the time the tenant vacated the premises, the tenant or a member of the tenant's household was under a credible imminent threat of domestic abuse or sexual violence at the premises, as demonstrated by medical, court or police evidence of domestic abuse or sexual violence; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The tenant gave seven (7) days written notice to the landlord prior to vacating the premises stating that the reason for vacating the premises was because of a credible imminent threat of domestic abuse or sexual violence against the tenant or a member of the tenant's household.</p>
                  <p>(b) In any action brought by a landlord against a tenant to recover rent for breach of lease, the tenant shall have an affirmative defense and not be liable for rent for the period after which a tenant vacates the premises owned by the landlord and covered by the lease, if by a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The tenant or a member of the tenant's household was a victim of domestic abuse or sexual violence on the premises that are owned or controlled by the landlord and the tenant has vacated the premises as a result of the sexual violence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The tenant gave seven (7) days written notice to the landlord prior to vacating the premises stating that the reason for vacating the premises was because of the domestic abuse or sexual violence against the tenant or a member of the tenant's household, the date of the sexual violence, and that the tenant provided medical, court or police evidence of domestic abuse or sexual violence to the landlord supporting the claim of domestic abuse or sexual violence; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The domestic abuse or sexual violence occurred not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of giving the written notice to the landlord, or if circumstances are such that the tenant could not reasonably give notice within that time period because of reasons related to the domestic abuse or sexual violence, including, but not limited to, hospitalization or seeking assistance for shelter or counseling, then as soon thereafter as practicable.</p>
                  <p>(c) A landlord may not terminate a tenancy based solely on the tenant's or applicant's or a household member's status as a victim of domestic abuse or sexual violence. This subsection does not prohibit adverse housing decisions based upon other lawful factors within the landlord's knowledge.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing in this act shall be construed to be a defense against:</p>
                  <p>(i) An action for recovery of rent for the period of time before the tenant vacated the landlord's premises and gave notice to the landlord as required in this section; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Forcible entry and detainer for failure to pay rent before the tenant gave notice to the landlord as required in this section and vacated the premises.</p>

                  <p>(a) Prior to the hearing a copy of the petition to adopt a child and all orders to show cause shall be served on any persons whose consent to adoption is required by W.S. 1-22-109 and whose consent has not been filed with the petition to adopt. Service shall be made in the same manner as provided for by rule 4 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be accomplished so that a default judgment could be rendered at the hearing against the person served. Service by publication is specifically allowed where the defendant resides out of state, or his residence cannot, with reasonable diligence, be ascertained.</p>
                  <p>(b) The petition and orders to show cause need not be served upon parents or other persons whose rights to the child have been terminated in a prior judicial proceeding.</p>

The consent of persons awarded visitation rights to the adoption is not required. However, the court may exercise its discretion to allow those persons an opportunity to be heard if the court finds it to be in the best interest and welfare of the child.</p>

                  <p>(a) When the persons required to be served as provided in W.S. 1-22-107 have been served personally or by publication and do not appear at the hearing, a default shall be entered against them and they shall be bound by the findings and judgment of the court.</p>
                  <p>(b) When any person whose consent is required objects to the petition to adopt, he shall at least five (5) days before the hearing file his objections and serve them on all parties to the proceedings, including any person whose consent has been filed.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the putative father files and serves his objections to the petition to adopt as provided in subsection (b) of this section, and appears at the hearing to acknowledge his paternity of the child, the court shall hear the evidence in support of the petition to adopt and in support of the objection to the petition and shall then determine whether:</p>

                  <p>(ii) The putative father having knowledge of the birth or pending birth of the child has evidenced an interest in and responsibility for the child within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the pending birth or birth of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The putative father's objections to the petition to adopt are valid; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The best interests and welfare of the child will be served by granting the putative father's claim to paternity or by allowing the petition to adopt.</p>
                  <p>(d) The putative father has no right to assert paternity in adoption, dependency or termination of parental rights proceedings unless he is known and identified by the mother or agency, or unless he has lived with or married the mother after the birth of the child and prior to the filing of the petition to adopt, and unless prior to the interlocutory hearing of the adoption proceedings, he has acknowledged the child as his own by affirmatively asserting paternity as provided in this section or registered as a putative father under W.S. 1-22-117.</p>
                  <p>(e) Based upon its determination and findings after a hearing, the court may enter its order or decree in accordance with W.S. 1-22-111.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>1-22-203. Confidential intermediaries; confidential intermediary services.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any person who has completed a confidential intermediary training program which meets the standards set forth by the commission shall be responsible for notifying the commission that his name should be included on the list of confidential intermediaries to be maintained by the commission and made available to the judicial branch. The commission's rules shall specify when and under what conditions the name of a confidential intermediary shall be removed from the list available to the judicial branch. Once a person is included on such list, he shall be:</p>
                  <p>(i) Authorized to inspect confidential relinquishment and adoption records, as ordered by the court, upon motion to the court by an adult adoptee, adoptive parent, biological parent, biological sibling or biological grandparent;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Available, subject to time constraints, for appointment by the court to act as a confidential intermediary for an adult adoptee, adoptive parent, biological parent, biological sibling or biological grandparent.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any adult adoptee, adoptive parent, biological parent, biological sibling or biological grandparent who is eighteen (18) years of age or older may file a motion, with supporting affidavit, in the court where the adoption took place or in the court in which parental rights were terminated pursuant to W.S. 14-2-308 through 14-2-319, to appoint one (1) or more confidential intermediaries for the purpose of determining the whereabouts of the unknown biological relative or relatives, except that no one shall seek to determine the whereabouts of a relative who is a minor. The court may rule on the motion and affidavit without hearing and may appoint a confidential intermediary. Costs related to the proceeding and investigation shall be the responsibility of the party filing the motion for appointment and investigation.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any information obtained by the confidential intermediary during the course of his investigation shall be kept strictly confidential and shall be utilized only for the purpose of arranging a contact between the individual who initiated the search and the sought-after biological relative.</p>
                  <p>(d) When a sought-after biological relative is located by a confidential intermediary on behalf of the individual who initiated the search:</p>
                  <p>(i) Contact shall be made between the parties involved in the investigation only when written consent for such contact has been obtained from both parties and filed with the court;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If consent for personal communication is not obtained from both parties, all relinquishment and adoption records and any information obtained by any confidential intermediary during the course of his investigation shall be returned to the court and shall remain confidential.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any person acting as a confidential intermediary who knowingly fails to comply with the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall be subject to citation and punishment for contempt as provided by Rule 42, Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>1-26-504. Requirements to exercise eminent domain.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, the power of eminent domain may be exercised to acquire property for a proposed use only if all of the following are established:</p>
                  <p>(i) The public interest and necessity require the project or the use of eminent domain is authorized by the Wyoming Constitution;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The project is planned or located in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The property sought to be acquired is necessary for the project.</p>
                  <p>(b) Findings of the public service commission, the interstate commerce commission and other federal and state agencies with appropriate jurisdiction are prima facie valid relative to determinations under subsection (a) of this section if the findings were made in accordance with law with notice to condemnees who are parties to the condemnation action and are final with no appeals from the determinations pending.</p>
                  <p>(c) When a public entity determines that there is a reasonable probability of locating a particular public project on specifically identifiable private property and that the project is expected to be completed within two (2) years of that determination, the public entity shall provide written notice of the intention to consider the location and construction of the project to the owner as shown on the records of the county assessor. The notice shall include a description of the public interest and necessity of the proposed project. The public entity shall provide an opportunity for the private property owners to consult and confer with representatives of the public entity regarding the project.</p>
                  <p>(d) A condemnor shall prove each requirement of subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section by a preponderance of the evidence. Failure of the condemnor to prove any requirement of subsection (a) of this section shall result in dismissal of the condemnation action without prejudice.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a proposed use cannot be obtained under W.S. 1-26-813, any condemnor may exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property appropriated to public use if the proposed use will not unreasonably interfere with or impair the continuance of the public use as it then exists or may reasonably be expected to exist in the future. The burden of proving that a proposed use will not unreasonably interfere with or impair the continuance of the existing public use is on the prospective condemnor.</p>
                  <p>(b) Where property is taken under subsection (a) of this section, the parties shall attempt to make an agreement determining the conditions upon which the property is taken and the manner and extent of its use by each of the parties. Except as otherwise provided by law, if the parties are unable to agree, the court shall fix the terms and conditions upon which the property is taken and the manner and extent of its use by each of the parties.</p>

                  <p>(a) A condemnor and its agents and employees may enter upon real property and make surveys, examinations, photographs, tests, soundings, borings and samplings, or engage in other activities for the purpose of appraising the property or determining whether it is suitable and within the power of the condemnor to condemn if the entry is:</p>
                  <p>(i) Preceded by prior notice to the condemnee specifying the particular activity to be undertaken and the proposed use and potential recipient of the data thereby obtained and the condemnee has been given fifteen (15) days to grant written authorization;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Undertaken during reasonable hours, normally during daylight;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Accomplished peaceably and without inflicting substantial injury to land, crops, improvements, livestock or current business operations.</p>

                  <p>(a) If reasonable efforts to accomplish a lawful entry or to perform authorized activities upon real property under W.S. 1-26-506 have been obstructed or denied the condemnor may apply to the district court for an order permitting entry.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless after notice and hearing good cause to the contrary is shown, the court shall make its order permitting and describing the purpose of the entry and setting forth the nature and scope of activities the court determines are reasonably necessary and authorized to be made upon the property. In addition to requiring a deposit under subsection (c) of this section, the order shall include terms and conditions with respect to the time, place and manner of entry and authorized activities upon the property which will facilitate the purpose of the entry and minimize damage, hardship and burden to the parties.</p>
                  <p>(c) An order permitting entry under subsection (b) of this section shall include a determination by the court of the amount, if any, that will fairly compensate the owner or any other person in lawful possession or physical occupancy of the property for damages for physical injury to the property and for substantial interference with its possession or use, found likely to be caused by the entry and activities authorized by the order and shall require the condemnor to deposit cash or other security with the court before entry. The clerk of court shall invest any cash deposit in any legal interest bearing investment and the interest earnings shall accrue to the account of the condemnor. Unless sooner disbursed by court order, the cash or other security shall be retained on deposit for six (6) months following termination of the entry. The court for good cause may extend the period of retention.</p>
                  <p>(d) After notice and hearing the court may modify an order under subsection (c) of this section. If a deposit is required or the amount required to be deposited is increased by an order of modification, the court shall specify the time within which the required amount must be deposited and may direct that any further entry or specified activities or studies under the order modified be stayed until the required deposit has been made.</p>

                  <p>(a) A condemnor is liable for physical injury to, and for substantial interference with possession or use of, property caused by his entry and activities upon the property. This liability may be enforced in a civil action against the condemnor or by application to the court as provided by subsection (c) of this section unless voluntarily paid by the condemnor.</p>
                  <p>(b) In an action or other proceeding for recovery of damages under this section, the prevailing party shall be allowed his costs. In addition, the court shall award the condemnee his litigation expenses incurred in any proceeding under W.S. 1-26-507 if it finds that the condemnor:</p>
                  <p>(i) Entered the property unlawfully;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Entered upon the property lawfully but thereafter engaged in activities upon the property which caused significant damage to the property not reasonably necessary to the purposes of the entry; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Failed substantially to comply with an order made under W.S. 1-26-507.</p>
                  <p>(c) If funds are on deposit under W.S. 1-26-507, the owner or other person entitled to damages under subsection (a) of this section may apply to the court for an award of the amount he is entitled to recover. The court shall determine the amount and award it to the person entitled thereto and direct that its payment be made out of the money on deposit. If the amount on deposit is insufficient to pay the full amount, the court shall enter judgment against the condemnor for the unpaid portion.</p>

                  <p>(a) At the time of commencing an eminent domain proceeding the condemnor shall deposit in court an amount equal to the condemnor's last offer of settlement prior to the action. Upon motion of the condemnee and following a hearing if the amount originally deposited is clearly inadequate, the court shall order the condemnor to make an additional deposit. The clerk of court shall invest the deposit in any legal interest bearing investment and interest earnings shall accrue to the account of the condemnor.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court may waive the requirement of a deposit for a public entity if the public entity is financially or legally unable to post the deposit but the public entity may not obtain possession of the property prior to judgment until the appropriate deposit is made.</p>
                  <p>(c) The condemnee may withdraw any portion of the deposit prior to final judgment which the court determines is not subject to claims of mortgagees and other claimants. The amount withdrawn constitutes a lien against the property of the condemnee and the condemnee is liable to the condemnor for any amount withdrawn which exceeds the final judgment in the action. If the condemnee withdraws any portion of the deposit prior to judgment, he waives all defenses to the action except the right to contest the amount to be awarded and the condemnor is entitled to immediate possession of the property subject to the court's determination of a reasonable period during which the condemnee can remove improvements and take other actions authorized by the court.</p>

In cases not involving public entities, following determination of due compensation the court shall enter an order granting an easement to the condemnor which shall not include any claim, interest or property in or to the underlying minerals or mineral estate except for subsurface support.</p>

                  <p>(i) The fair market value of property for which there is a relevant market is the price which would be agreed to by an informed seller who is willing but not obligated to sell, and an informed buyer who is willing but not obligated to buy;</p>

                  <p>(A) The value determined by appraisal of the property performed by a certified appraiser;</p>

                  <p>(i) The property is devoted to and is needed by the owner in order to continue in good faith its actual use to perform a public function, or to render nonprofit educational, religious, charitable or eleemosynary services; and</p>

                  <p>(b) The compensation for an interest in improvements is the higher of the fair market value of the improvements, assuming their immediate removal from the property, or the amount by which the existence of the improvements enhances the fair market value of the property.</p>
                  <p>(c) If improvements are destroyed, removed or damaged by the condemnee after the date of valuation, the amount of compensation shall be adjusted to reflect the extent to which the fair market value of the property has thereby been reduced.</p>
                  <p>(d) Crops or improvements that are first placed upon the property after the date of valuation shall be excluded from consideration in determining the amount of the award, except that the award shall be adjusted to include the reasonable and necessary cost of providing improvements required by law and improvements necessary to protect life or property as authorized by the court.</p>

                  <p>(a) If all or part of the property taken includes a leasehold interest, the effect of the condemnation action upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the lease is governed by the provisions of the lease, and in the absence of applicable provisions in the lease, by this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) If there is a partial taking and the part of the property taken includes a leasehold interest that extends to the remainder, the court may determine that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The lease terminates as to the part of the property taken but remains in force as to the remainder, in which case the rent reserved in the lease is extinguished to the extent it is affected by the taking; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The lease terminates as to both the part taken and the remainder, if the part taken is essential to the purposes of the lease or the remainder is no longer suitable for the purpose of the lease.</p>
                  <p>(c) The termination or partial termination of a lease under this section shall occur at the earlier of the date on which, under an order of the court, the condemnor is permitted to take possession of the property, or the date on which title to the property is transferred to the condemnor.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section does not affect or impair a lessee's right to compensation if his leasehold interest is taken in whole or in part.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to fair market value determined under W.S. 1-26-704, the owner of a business conducted on the property taken, or on the remainder if there is a partial taking, shall be compensated for loss of goodwill only if the owner proves that the loss:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is caused by the taking of the property or the injury to the remainder;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Cannot reasonably be prevented by a relocation of the business or by taking steps and adopting procedures that a reasonably prudent person would take and adopt in preserving the goodwill;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Will not be included in relocation payments under W.S. 16-7-101 through 16-7-121; and</p>

                  <p>(i) Damages caused by the condemnor, its successors or its agents during entry prior to condemnation as authorized by W.S. 1-26-506 and 1-26-507;</p>

                  <p>(iii) Damages caused by the condemnor, its successors or its agents subsequent to the construction and during the use of the property during the time of the condemnor's possession;</p>

                  <p>(a) The state or any county or municipal corporation may purchase or acquire by condemnation any real estate including streets, alleys or public highways, as sites for public buildings or for any other necessary public purpose. Proceedings in condemnation shall be conducted in the name of the state, county or municipal corporation and by the attorney general when for the state, the county attorney when for the county and the municipal attorney when for a municipal corporation.</p>
                  <p>(b) In carrying out responsibilities under P.L. 95-604, the state may purchase or acquire by condemnation any real estate or radioactive materials if determined necessary to stabilize and control uranium mill tailings in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Proceedings in condemnation shall be as provided by this act.</p>
                  <p>(c) As used in and for purposes of this section only, "public purpose" means the possession, occupation and enjoyment of the land by a public entity. "Public purpose" shall not include the taking of private property by a public entity for the purpose of transferring the property to another private individual or private entity except in the case of condemnation for the purpose of protecting the public health and safety, in which event the public entity may transfer the condemned property for value to a private individual or entity. However, nothing in this section shall restrict or impair the right or authority of the Wyoming energy authority to transfer property condemned by the authority to another public or private entity insofar as the transfer is consistent with the statutory purposes or duties of the authority.</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed by Laws 2019, ch. 34, § 4.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 2019, ch. 34, § 4.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a public entity acquires property in fee simple title under this chapter but fails to make substantial use of the property for a period of ten (10) years, there is a presumption that the property is no longer needed for a public purpose and the previous owner or his successor may apply to the court to request that the property be returned to the previous owner or his successor upon repayment of the amount originally received for the property in the condemnation action. A public entity may rebut the presumption created under this subsection by showing good cause for the delay in using the property.</p>

                <p>(i) The award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;</p>
                <p>(ii) There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption of any of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;</p>
                <p>(iii) The arbitrators exceeded their powers;</p>
                <p>(iv) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown, refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise conducted the hearing as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or</p>
                <p>(v) There was no arbitration agreement, the issue was not adversely determined by a court as provided by law and the applicant did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection. The fact that the relief was such that it could not or would not be granted by a court of law or equity is not a ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.</p>
                <p>(b) An application for vacating an award shall be made within ninety (90) days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant, or if predicated upon corruption, fraud or other undue means it shall be made within ninety (90) days after the grounds are known or should have been known.</p>
                <p>(c) In vacating the award on grounds other than stated in paragraph (a)(v) of this section the court may order a rehearing before new arbitrators chosen as provided in the agreement or by the court in accordance with W.S. 1-36-105. If the award is vacated on grounds set forth in paragraph (a)(iii) or (iv) of this section the court may order a rehearing before the arbitrators who made the award or their successors appointed in accordance with W.S. 1-36-105. The time within which the agreement requires the award to be made is applicable to the rehearing and commences from the date of the order.</p>
                <p>(d) If the application to vacate is denied and no motion to modify or correct the award is pending, the court shall confirm the award.</p>

                <p>(a) The state of Wyoming upon the relation of the attorney general may institute an action to have determined in a general adjudication the nature, extent, and relative priority of the water rights of all persons in any river system and all other sources, provided:</p>
                <p>(i) For the purposes of this section:</p>
                <p>(A) The term "general adjudication" shall mean the judicial determination or establishment of the extent and priority of the rights to use water of all persons on any river system and all other sources within the state of Wyoming. The court conducting such a general adjudication shall:</p>
                <p>(I) Certify to the state board of control those legal and factual issues which the court deems appropriate for the board to determine. Upon such certification, the board shall exercise those powers and follow those procedures set forth in Rule 53 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure;</p>
                <p>(II) Confirm those rights evidenced by previous court decrees, or by certificates of appropriation, or by certificates of construction heretofore issued by the Wyoming state board of control;</p>
                <p>(III) Determine the status of all uncancelled permits to acquire the right to the use of the water of the state of Wyoming and adjudicate all perfected rights thereunder not theretofore adjudicated under W.S. 41-4-511;</p>
                <p>(IV) Determine the extent and priority date of and adjudicate any interest in or right to use the water of the river system and all other sources not otherwise represented by the aforedescribed decrees, certificates, or permits;</p>
                <p>(V) Establish, in whatever form determined to be most appropriate by the court, one or more tabulations or lists of all water rights and their relative priorities on the river system and all other sources.</p>
                <p>(B) The word "person" shall be construed to mean an individual, a partnership, a corporation, a municipality, the state of Wyoming, the United States of America, or any other legal entity, public or private.</p>
                <p>(ii) When the potential defendants number one thousand (1,000) or more, personal service of a summons and complaint shall not be required and (A) the court shall order that the clerk obtain service on known potential defendants by mailing a court-approved notice of the action by certified mail, return receipt requested, and (B) the court shall order that the clerk obtain service on all unknown parties by publication of said notice for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in each of the counties within which interests in and rights to the use of water may be affected by the adjudication.</p>
                <p>If there is no newspaper in one (1) or more of said counties, then publication for such counties shall be in one (1) or more newspapers published in the state, and of general circulation within said counties. If publication is in a daily newspaper, one (1) insertion a week shall be sufficient;</p>
                <p>(iii) The complaint for such a general adjudication shall be captioned: "In re the General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the .... River System and All Other Sources, State of Wyoming";</p>
                <p>(iv) When the water rights to be determined are located in more than one (1) county, the general adjudication may be brought in any of the counties.</p>

                <p>(c) The appointment of the wrongful death representative is a procedural device intended to provide a representative to investigate and bring an action under W.S. 1-38-101. Irregularities in the manner or method of appointment are not jurisdictional.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>1-39-102. Purpose.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The Wyoming legislature recognizes the inherently unfair and inequitable results which occur in the strict application of the doctrine of governmental immunity and is cognizant of the Wyoming Supreme Court decision of Oroz v. Board of County Commissioners 575 P. 2d 1155 (1978). It is further recognized that the state and its political subdivisions as trustees of public revenues are constituted to serve the inhabitants of the state of Wyoming and furnish certain services not available through private parties and, in the case of the state, state revenues may only be expended upon legislative appropriation. This act is adopted by the legislature to balance the respective equities between persons injured by governmental actions and the taxpayers of the state of Wyoming whose revenues are utilized by governmental entities on behalf of those taxpayers. This act is intended to retain any common law defenses which a defendant may have by virtue of decisions from this or other jurisdictions.</p>
                <p>(b) In the case of the state, this act abolishes all judicially created categories such as "governmental" or "proprietary" functions and "discretionary" or "ministerial" acts previously used by the courts to determine immunity or liability. This act does not impose nor allow the imposition of strict liability for acts of governmental entities or public employees.</p>

There is no obligation on the state legislature or the local governing body to make any appropriation for payment of property damage claims;</p>
                <p>(iv) If the director of the department of administration and information or the local government official determines there may be insufficient monies to pay all of the claims made during the year, then the director or official may delay paying the claims until close of the year at which time available monies shall be prorated among those entitled to payment at an amount less than one hundred percent (100%);</p>
                <p>(v) The decisions of the director of the department of administration and information or of the local government official are final and are not subject to administrative or judicial review.</p>

                  <p>(a) The victim or his dependent is entitled to compensation under this act if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The victim suffered personal injury as a result of a criminal act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 1989, ch. 233, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The injury to or death of the victim was not attributable to his own wrongful act;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The appropriate law enforcement authorities were notified of the criminal act allegedly causing the injury to or death of the victim as soon as practical under the circumstance after perpetration of the offense and the claimant cooperates with appropriate law enforcement authorities with respect to the crime for which compensation is sought;</p>

                  <p>(viii) Releases authorizing the surrender to the division of all reports, medical records and other information relating to the claim and crime; and</p>
                  <p>(ix) Any other information the division reasonably requires.</p>
                  <p>(b) The division may require that materials substantiating the facts stated in the application be submitted with the application. If the division finds that an application does not contain the required information or that the facts stated therein have not been substantiated, it shall notify the applicant in writing of the specific additional items or information or materials required and that the applicant has thirty (30) days from the date of the notice in which to furnish those items to the division. The division shall reject the application of an applicant who although notified fails to file the requested information or substantiating materials within the time specified unless he requests, and the division grants, an extension of time in which to furnish that information.</p>
                  <p>(c) An applicant may file an amended application or additional substantiating materials to correct inadvertent errors or omissions at any time before the division disposes of the original application.

                  <p>(a) Hearings shall be held on the application and are open to the public unless the division determines that a closed hearing is necessary because:</p>
                  <p>(i) The alleged assailant or offender has not been brought to trial and a public hearing would adversely affect either his apprehension or his trial;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The victim or alleged assailant is a minor;</p>
                  <p>(iii) An open hearing would cause trauma for the victim;</p>
                  <p>(iv) A public hearing would frustrate rather than further the interest of justice.</p>
                  <p>(b) A record shall be kept of the proceedings of hearings held before the division and shall include the division's findings of fact and conclusions of the amount of compensation, if any, to which the applicant and persons dependent on a deceased victim are entitled. No part of the record of any hearing before the division may be used for any purpose in a criminal proceeding except in the prosecution of a person alleged to have perjured himself in his testimony before the division.</p>
                  <p>(c) At the conclusion of the hearing, the division shall enter an order stating:</p>
                  <p>(i) Its findings of fact;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Its decision as to whether or not compensation is due under this act and the amount of compensation due, if any;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether disbursement of the compensation awarded is to be made in a lump sum or in periodic payments; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The person or persons to whom the compensation should be paid.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the division finds, in the case of an application made by a person dependent for his support on a deceased victim, that persons other than the applicant were also dependent on that victim for their support, it shall also:</p>
                  <p>(i) Name those persons in its order;</p>
                  <p>(ii) State the percentage share of the total compensation award and the dollar amount to which each is entitled; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Order that those amounts be paid to those persons directly or, in the case of a minor or incompetent, to his guardian or conservator, as the case may be.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the division may promulgate rules providing for an expedited claims process for applications in which eligibility is clear and all information has been verified.</p>

                  <p>(a) For the purpose of determining the amount of compensation payable pursuant to this act, the division, insofar as practicable, shall formulate standards for uniform application of this act and shall take into consideration rates and amounts of compensation payable for injuries and death under other laws of this state and of the United States and the availability of funds under this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) Loss of earnings and loss of future earnings shall be determined on the basis of the victim's average monthly earnings for the six (6) months immediately preceding the date of the injury, or the current federal minimum wage, whichever is less.</p>
                  <p>(c) Loss of support shall be determined on the basis of the victim's or defendant's average monthly earnings for the six (6) months immediately preceding the date of the injury, or the current federal minimum wage, whichever is less.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the maximum individual award of compensation paid to any victim or dependent shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00). Compensation shall only be awarded for economic losses occurring within a twenty-four (24) month period from the date of the injury or discovery of the crime. However, the division may extend the twenty-four (24) month period to allow compensation for mental health counseling and care occurring within an additional twelve (12) month period for a total of thirty-six (36) months.</p>
                  <p>(e) In addition to the maximum award authorized in subsection (d) of this section, in the case of catastrophic injury the division may award an additional amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to the victim to cover future lost wages, special medical needs and any other special assistance needed as a result of the injury. The additional award may be made only for economic losses occurring within twenty-four (24) months after the date of the injury or discovery of the crime.</p>

                  <p>(a) If a person is injured or killed by a criminal act, the division may order the payment of compensation in accordance with this act for:</p>
                  <p>(i) Expenses actually and reasonably incurred as a result of the personal injury or death of the victim, by the victim, his dependent, or any person responsible for the victim's maintenance;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Loss of earning power as a result of the victim's total or partial incapacity;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Economic loss to the deceased victim's dependents; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any other loss resulting from the personal injury or death of the victim which the division determines to be reasonable.</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining whether to award compensation under this act, the division shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) All circumstances surrounding the victim's conduct determined to be relevant which directly contributed to the victim's injury or death;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Need for financial aid; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any other relevant matters.</p>
                  <p>(c) The division shall not consider whether the alleged assailant has been apprehended, prosecuted or convicted, nor the result of any criminal proceedings against him.</p>
                  <p>(d) The crime victims compensation account is not a state health program and is not intended to be used as a primary payor to other health care assistance programs, but is a public, quasi-charitable fund whose fundamental purpose is to assist victims of violent crimes through a period of financial hardship as a payor of last resort. Payment made in accordance with this section shall be considered payment of last resort that follows all other sources and is provided subsequent to all other benefits. Accordingly, in determining the amount of compensation to be allowed by order, the division shall consider amounts received or receivable from any other source or sources by the victim or his dependents as a result of the incident or offense giving rise to the application. The division shall not deny compensation solely because the applicant is entitled to income from a collateral source.</p>

                  <p>(b) The amount of the emergency award shall be dependent on the applicant's immediate and verifiable needs as a result of loss of income or support, for emergency medical treatment, or for funeral and burial expenses. The amount of an emergency award to an applicant shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(c) Any emergency award granted under this section shall be deducted from the final compensation award made to the applicant.

                  <p>(i) In making payment of the debt a condition of probation or parole, the court or state board of parole shall set the schedule or amounts of payments, subject to modification based on change of circumstances;</p>

                <p>The legislature recognizes that certain liability insurance policies of the state of Wyoming have been cancelled, that no responsive bids have been received and that there exists a need to develop a method to handle claims brought under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act and arising under federal law. The legislature declares that the appropriate remedy is to create an account for self-insurance of the state and to provide for a loss prevention program. It is the intent of the legislature that the self-insurance account shall be operated on an actuarially sound basis. The legislature further declares that its intent is that the availability of commercial liability insurance coverage shall be explored considering the possibility that the insurance industry can provide coverage in the future that is less expensive than the costs of providing a loss prevention program and paying for claims out of the self-insurance account.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>1-42-202. Local government self-insurance program; creation; authorized payments.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) There is created the local government self-insurance program to provide a mechanism for local governments to pool resources to handle claims brought against local governments under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act and arising under federal law. It is the intent of the legislature that the local government self-insurance program shall be operated by a joint powers board formed by local governments participating in the program and administered in accordance with the provisions of this act. The program shall provide for assessments by participating local governments, which together with all income from investments of the program and payments by insurance or reinsurance companies are actuarially sufficient to meet anticipated claims against participating local governments and all associated administrative expenses.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon approval of the board, expenditures shall be made by the program for the following claims which have been settled or reduced to final judgment:</p>
                  <p>(i) Claims brought against participating local governments, other than eligible senior citizen centers or their public employees, other than peace officers, under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Claims against participating local governments or their judicial officers or public employees, other than peace officers, arising under 42 U.S.C. 1983 or other federal statutes subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Claims brought against participating eligible senior citizen centers, including its directors, officers, employees and volunteers, arising from acts within the scope of their activities in rendering any service that a senior citizen center may lawfully render;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Claims against contract physicians, physician assistants, nurses, optometrists or dentists brought under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act or federal law, provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) The contract physician, physician assistant, nurse, optometrist or dentist is unable to procure medical malpractice insurance coverage up to the limits specified in W.S. 1-39-110(b) or 1-39-118(a) as applicable;</p>
                  <p>(B) The liability of the county shall not exceed limits specified in W.S. 1-39-118(a) except as the limitation may be increased by W.S. 1-39-110(b) both reduced by the amount of the contract physician's, physician assistant's, nurse's, optometrist's or dentist's malpractice insurance coverage applicable to such claim; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The claim arises from the services performed by the physician, physician assistant, nurse, optometrist or dentist for a county jail.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon approval of the board, expenditures may also be made from the program for expenses related to claims under subsection (b) of this section, administrative expenses, insurance and services procured in accordance with W.S. 1-42-203.</p>
                  <p>(d) Claims against participating local governments and their public employees, or a judicial officer exercising the authority vested in him, arising under 42 U.S.C. 1983 or other federal statutes, shall be defended and indemnification paid subject to the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Public employees of participating local governments, other than peace officers, shall be defended and, to the extent provided by paragraph (v) of this subsection, indemnified against any claim or demand, whether groundless or otherwise, arising out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the scope of duty;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any civil action, suit or proceeding which is brought against any public employee which on its face falls within the provisions of paragraph (i) of this subsection, or which the public employee, other than peace officers, asserts is based on an alleged act or omission in the scope of duty, shall be defended under the program with an automatic reservation of right by the board to reject the claim unless the act or omission is determined to be within the scope of duty. Any public employee against whom a claim within the scope of this subsection is made shall cooperate fully in the defense of the claim. If the board determines that the public employee has not cooperated or has otherwise acted to prejudice defense of the claim, the defense of the claim may be rejected at any time;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Unless the act or omission upon which a claim is based is determined by the court or jury to be within the public employee's scope of duty, no funds shall be expended from the program in payment of the final judgment against the public employee;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Increase the limits of liability under W.S. 1-39-118 for claims brought under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act;</p>
                  <p>(B) Affect the liability of a participating local government or of any of its public employees on any claim arising out of the same accident or occurrence; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Waive the protection of a local government or its public employees from liability where immunity has not been specifically waived.</p>
                  <p>(e) The program shall be limited in liability to payment of no more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) for any one (1) occurrence plus loss adjustment expenses. Participating local governments shall be responsible for the amount of any adjudicated claims and expenses in excess of this amount.</p>
                  <p>(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, no expenditure shall be made from the program in any action to pay any claim or final judgment for exemplary or punitive damages.</p>
