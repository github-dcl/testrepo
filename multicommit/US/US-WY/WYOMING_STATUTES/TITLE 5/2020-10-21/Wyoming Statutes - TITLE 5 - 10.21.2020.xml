                <p><shortTitle>5-1-106. Retirement of judges of the supreme court or district courts; pension; assignment of retired judges.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A judge of the supreme court or district courts shall retire when he attains the age of seventy (70) years. A judge is eligible for retirement when he has served as a judge of the supreme court, a district court or both for:</p>
                <p>(i) Not less than eighteen (18) years;</p>
                <p>(ii) Not less than fifteen (15) years and is sixty-five (65) years of age or more;</p>
                <p>(iii) Not less than twelve (12) years and is seventy (70) years of age or more;</p>
                <p>(iv) Not less than six (6) consecutive years and is sixty-five (65) years of age or more;</p>
                <p>(v) Less than six (6) years but continuously from the date of appointment to the age of seventy (70) years;</p>
                <p>(vi) Not less than twelve (12) years and is fifty-five (55) years of age or more;</p>
                <p>(vii) Not less than six (6) years and dies in office or is retired by the supreme court for disability.</p>
                <p>(b) Retired judges shall receive a maximum lifetime annual pension of fifty percent (50%) of the salary currently authorized by law for judges of the court from which they retired. The pension of a judge retiring under paragraph (a)(iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of this section shall be that proportion of the maximum allowable pension which the aggregate number of years of his judicial service bears to eighteen (18) years. The pension shall increase or diminish proportionately as salaries of judges of the respective courts change. The pension of any judge who retires under paragraph (a)(iv) of this section at the age of seventy (70) with not less than six (6) but less than twelve (12) years service shall be that proportion of the maximum allowable pension which the aggregate number of years of judicial service bears to twelve (12) years.</p>
                <p>(c) To retire and receive a pension, a judge shall notify in writing the governor and the state auditor the date he elects to retire and shall furnish with the notice an affidavit showing the date and place of his birth and his service as a judge entitling him to a pension, provided, that a judge whose service is terminated by expiration of the term for which he is elected or appointed and whose service is such as to otherwise entitle him to receive the pension herein provided, shall be deemed to have retired.</p>
                <p>(d) This section shall apply to judges who were appointed prior to July 1, 1998 and to judges who have retired and are receiving benefits under this section. Judicial retirement for justices and judges appointed to the bench on or after July 1, 1998 is provided pursuant to W.S. 9-3-701 through 9-3-713.</p>
                <p>(e) Any judge who is otherwise eligible to receive a pension may receive the benefits accorded by this section if he retires on the day of attainment of the age of seventy (70) years, or prior thereto, provided that if he is a judge on the effective date of this act, he may complete the present term for which he was elected or appointed without the loss of any pension benefits accorded by this section.</p>
                <p>(f) Any justice of the supreme court or district court judge of this state, who has retired pursuant to the provisions of this section, and who is not practicing law, may, notwithstanding his retirement, be called upon, with his consent, at the request of a district court judge, with the consent of the chief justice, or by the chief justice, and assigned to service on any court. A retired justice or judge shall receive as a salary during any period of assignment an amount equal to the current compensation of a judge of the court to which he is assigned. The salary received by a retired justice or judge during any period of assignment shall not affect the receipt of any retirement allowance received by the retired justice or judge during the period of assignment. Assignments of retired justices or judges under this section shall only be made in a manner that does not jeopardize the qualified status of state retirement plans established by the Wyoming legislature. When called to serve, a retired judge or justice shall receive the same per diem and travel allowances as allowed active judges or justices. Per diem, allowances and compensation shall be paid from the contingent fund of the court to which the judge or justice is assigned.</p>
                <p>(g) In lieu of the service retirement allowances provided in subsection (b) of this section, any judge specified in subsection (a) of this section may elect one (1) of the following forms of retirement benefits which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the allowance to which he would otherwise be entitled as determined by the actuary for the state retirement system:</p>
                <p>(i) A full joint and survivor benefit which provides reduced monthly service retirement benefit payments during the retired member's life and upon his death after retirement continues payments in the same reduced amount to a designated beneficiary during the life of that beneficiary;</p>
                <p>(ii) A half joint and survivor benefit which provides reduced monthly service retirement benefit payments during the retired member's life and upon his death after retirement continues payments, in the amount of one-half (1/2) of such reduced amount, to the designated beneficiary during the life of that beneficiary.</p>
                <p>(h) A judge who is eligible for retirement may elect one (1) of the retirement benefit forms in subsection (g) of this section during the time the judge is serving in office. Payment of the pension or survivor benefit shall commence upon the retirement of the judge or upon the death of the judge while serving in office, based on the years of service at retirement or death in office. If a survivor benefit was elected as provided in paragraph (g) of this section by a judge who is no longer in active service and dies before retirement, the survivor benefit shall commence upon the earliest date the judge would have been eligible to retire unless the designated beneficiary elects a later date.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>5-2-122. Indigent civil legal services program created; purposes.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) An indigent civil legal services program is created to be operated in accordance with the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The supreme court shall develop a comprehensive plan for funding a statewide program of civil legal services to the indigent from the account. By November 1, 2010 and again by May 1, 2011, the court shall submit to the joint appropriations interim committee and the joint judiciary interim committee reports on the plan of operation for the program;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The supreme court may operate the program directly, or contract with a nonprofit organization to operate the program;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The court shall adopt rules and regulations for the program prior to implementation subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) In adopting rules and regulations governing the program the court shall set the following priorities, which are not intended to be exclusive, but to provide direction on the management and operation of the program:</p>
                  <p>(I) Cases in which an indigent individual is a defendant in a lawsuit;</p>
                  <p>(II) Cases in which an indigent individual is seeking to enforce a court order;</p>
                  <p>(III) Cases involving domestic relations and family law;</p>
                  <p>(IV) Matters involving general legal advice to indigent individuals.</p>
                  <p>(B) In adopting rules and regulations governing the program, the court shall prohibit the program from providing legal representation in the following areas:</p>

                  <p>(II) Criminal defense;</p>
                  <p>(III) Cases against public agencies or political subdivisions seeking to change or overturn existing rules, regulations and policies. This prohibition shall not limit the program's ability to represent indigent individuals who are seeking benefits that may be owed them by public entities.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The rules shall establish eligibility standards for the receipt of services. The eligibility standards shall require that civil legal services be funded from the account only for individuals whose total household income does not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the federal poverty level;</p>
                  <p>(v) The program shall be operated in coordination with other publicly or privately funded programs providing civil legal services to the indigent with a goal of developing an integrated system for the delivery of indigent civil legal services on a statewide basis by July 1, 2011;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The program shall be coordinated with the Wyoming state bar and other entities on private attorney involvement, pro bono civil legal services and educational programs;</p>
                  <p>(vii) For funding under the program, the program shall establish a statewide single point of entry for indigent civil legal services or establish other operations that allow for simplified and easily available access to the program;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The program may grant funds to existing eligible programs to assist in providing civil legal services and may be used to enhance the civil legal services that the existing programs are providing;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The program may receive grants and donations which shall be deposited to the account;</p>
                  <p>(x) The program shall establish uniform standards for the delivery of civil legal services and operate programmatic and fiscal management programs to ensure accountability for all funds.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding W.S. 7-13-302 through 7-13-305, when imposing a fine for breach of an ordinance that is punishable by fine only, a municipal judge may suspend all or part of the fine for a specified period, not to exceed six (6) months, during which the defendant must meet specified conditions. The conditions imposed shall only require the defendant to conform his conduct to the requirements of the ordinance and shall not prohibit lawful conduct. When suspending a fine, a municipal judge must:</p>
                  <p>(i) Specify the amount of the fine to be suspended; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Specify the conditions the defendant must meet to avoid imposition of the suspended portion of the fine, including the date by which the conditions must be met.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a defendant fails to comply with the conditions specified, the municipality may commence proceedings to impose the suspended portion of the fine during the period of suspension or within thirty (30) days thereafter. If after notice and a hearing the court determines the defendant failed to comply with the conditions of the suspended fine, the court may proceed to deal with the case as if no suspension of fine had been ordered.</p>

                  <p>(a) The judges of the circuit courts may hold court for each other and shall do so when required by law. The expenses of any judge of a circuit court holding court in any circuit other than his own or in any district court pursuant to assignment under W.S. 5-3-112, including travel expenses and his expenses while holding court, shall be charged to the contingent fund of the circuit court in whose circuit he is holding court or to the contingent fund of the district court in whose district he is holding court pursuant to assignment under W.S. 5-3-112.</p>
                  <p>(b) A party to any action in circuit court may disqualify a circuit judge as provided by rules adopted by the supreme court for disqualification. Upon disqualification, or inability for any reason to fulfill his duties, the circuit judge shall appoint another circuit judge from his own or a different circuit or a district judge from his own or a different district, or a magistrate from the county in which the case is to be tried if no other circuit judge is available, to try the action.</p>

During any period of assignment, a retired circuit court judge shall receive as compensation an amount equal to the current compensation of a judge of the court to which he is assigned. The compensation received by a retired circuit court judge during any period of assignment shall not affect the receipt of any retirement allowance of the retired circuit court judge during the period of assignment. Assignments of retired circuit court judges under this section shall only be made in a manner that does not jeopardize the qualified status of state retirement plans established by the Wyoming legislature. When called to serve, a retired circuit court judge shall receive the same per diem and travel allowance as allowed active circuit court judges. Per diem allowances and compensation shall be paid from the contingent fund of the court to which the retired judge is assigned.</p>
