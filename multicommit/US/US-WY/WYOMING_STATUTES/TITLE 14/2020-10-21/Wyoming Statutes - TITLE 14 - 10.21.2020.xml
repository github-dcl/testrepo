                  <p>(a) Any property owner is entitled to recover damages from the parents of any minor under the age of seventeen (17) years and over the age of ten (10) years who maliciously and willfully damages or destroys his property. The recovery is limited to the actual damages in an amount not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) in addition to taxable court costs. This section does not apply to parents whose parental custody and control of the child had been terminated by court order prior to the destructive act.</p>

The purpose of this section is to authorize recovery from parents in situations where they would not otherwise be liable.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person legally responsible for the support of a child who abandons, deserts, neglects or unjustifiably fails to support the child is liable for support of the child. It is no defense that the child was not or is not in destitute circumstances. For purposes of this section, a parent's legal obligation for the support of his or her children, whether natural or adopted, continues past the age of majority in cases where the children are:</p>
                  <p>(i) Mentally or physically disabled and thereby incapable of self support; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2000, Ch. 1, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Between the age of majority and twenty (20) years and attending high school or an equivalent program as full-time participants.</p>
                  <p>(b) Either of the parents of the child, the department of family services or any other person, agency or institution furnishing the physical care or support of the child may commence civil action for past and future child and medical support.</p>
                  <p>(c) The petition or complaint shall be filed in the district court of the county where the defendant resides, is found or has assets subject to attachment or execution. Service of process shall be as provided by the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
                  <p>(d) The measure of recovery from the defendant is the reasonable value of the care or support, including medical support furnished to the child by the petitioner and the child support ordered pursuant to W.S. 20-2-303, 20-2-304, 20-2-307 and 20-2-311. In addition, the court may make other suitable order for future care or support of the child. These remedies are cumulative and in addition to other remedies provided by law. Payments of future support shall be paid to the clerk of the district court.</p>

                  <p>(a) It is the responsibility of one (1) or both parents, and the guardian or custodian of an unemancipated minor, if applicable, to appear with the minor before any court of this state in any proceeding in which the minor is required to appear and is alleged to have committed a criminal offense or to have violated a municipal ordinance. It shall be the responsibility of the court to afford any parent, guardian or custodian appearing with a minor pursuant to this subsection a reasonable opportunity to address the court.</p>
                  <p>(b) In any proceeding in juvenile court, attendance of one or both parents, and the guardian or custodian of the minor, if applicable, shall be compelled as provided by W.S. 14-6-215.</p>
                  <p>(c) In a proceeding in a court other than the juvenile court, the presiding judge may require the presence of one or both parents, and the guardian or custodian of the minor, if applicable, at any hearing by causing an order to appear to be served in the manner provided by W.S. 14-6-214.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any person served with an order to appear under subsection (c) of this section who without reasonable cause fails to appear, is liable for contempt of court and the court may issue a bench warrant to cause the person to be brought before the court.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>14-2-309. Grounds for termination of parent-child relationship; clear and convincing evidence.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The parent-child legal relationship may be terminated if any one (1) or more of the following facts is established by clear and convincing evidence:</p>
                  <p>(i) The child has been left in the care of another person without provision for the child's support and without communication from the absent parent for a period of at least one (1) year. In making the above determination, the court may disregard occasional contributions, or incidental contacts and communications. For purposes of this paragraph, a court order of custody shall not preclude a finding that a child has been left in the care of another person;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The child has been abandoned with no means of identification for at least three (3) months and efforts to locate the parent have been unsuccessful;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The child has been abused or neglected by the parent and reasonable efforts by an authorized agency or mental health professional have been unsuccessful in rehabilitating the family or the family has refused rehabilitative treatment, and it is shown that the child's health and safety would be seriously jeopardized by remaining with or returning to the parent;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The parent is incarcerated due to the conviction of a felony and a showing that the parent is unfit to have the custody and control of the child;</p>
                  <p>(v) The child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the state of Wyoming for fifteen (15) of the most recent twenty-two (22) months, and a showing that the parent is unfit to have custody and control of the child;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The child is abandoned at less than one (1) year of age and has been abandoned for at least six (6) months;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The child was relinquished to a safe haven provider in accordance with W.S. 14-11-101 through 14-11-109, and neither parent has affirmatively sought the return of the child within three (3) months from the date of relinquishment;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The parent is convicted of murder or homicide of the other parent of the child under W.S. 6-2-101 through 6-2-104;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The parent committed sexual assault and the child was conceived as a result of the sexual assault. For the purposes of this paragraph, the following shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(A) A person committed sexual assault if the person was convicted of an offense under W.S. 6-2-302, 6-2-303, 6-2-314 through 6-2-316 or other similar law of another jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(B) Reasonable effort to reunify the family is not required to terminate parental rights;</p>
                  <p>(C) This paragraph shall not apply if the parent seeking termination was married to or cohabiting with the parent committing the sexual assault resulting in the birth of the child for not less than two (2) years immediately after the birth of the child. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as limiting a parent from seeking termination under another provision of this section or from seeking sole custody under title 20, chapter 5 of the Wyoming statutes.</p>
                  <p>(b) Proof by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of any of the following crimes may constitute grounds that the parent is unfit to have custody or control of any child and may be grounds for terminating the parent-child relationship as to any child with no requirement that reasonable efforts be made to reunify the family:</p>
                  <p>(i) Murder or voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent or aiding and abetting, attempting, conspiring to commit or soliciting such a crime; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Commission of a felony assault which results in serious bodily injury to a child of the parent. As used in this paragraph "serious bodily injury" means as defined by W.S. 6-1-104.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, evidence that reasonable efforts have been made to preserve and reunify the family is not required in any case in which the court determines any one (1) or more of the following by clear and convincing evidence:</p>
                  <p>(i) The parental rights of the parent to any other child have been terminated involuntarily;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The parent abandoned, chronically abused, tortured or sexually abused the child;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The parent has been convicted of committing one (1) or more of the following crimes against the child or another child of that parent:</p>
                  <p>(A) Sexual assault under W.S. 6-2-302 through 6-2-304; (B) Sexual battery under W.S. 6-2-313;</p>
                  <p>(C) Sexual abuse of a minor under W.S. 6-2-314 through 6-2-317.</p>
                  <p>(iv) The parent is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to W.S. 7-19-302 if the offense involved the child or another child of that parent. This shall not apply if the parent is only required to register for conviction under W.S. 6-2-201;</p>
                  <p>(v) Other aggravating circumstances exist indicating that there is little likelihood that services to the family will result in successful reunification.</p>

                  <p>(a) An acknowledgment of paternity shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Be in a record;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be signed, or otherwise authenticated, under penalty for false swearing by the mother and by the man seeking to establish his paternity;</p>

                  <p>(A) Does not have a presumed father, or has a presumed father whose full name is stated; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Does not have another acknowledged or adjudicated father.</p>
                  <p>(iv) State whether there has been genetic testing and, if so, that the acknowledging man's claim of paternity is consistent with the results of the testing; and</p>
                  <p>(v) State that the signatories understand that the acknowledgment is the equivalent of a judicial adjudication of paternity of the child and that a challenge to the acknowledgment is permitted only under limited circumstances and is barred after two (2) years.</p>
                  <p>(b) An acknowledgment of paternity is void if it:</p>
                  <p>(i) States that another man is a presumed father, unless a denial of paternity signed or otherwise authenticated by the presumed father or a court order rebutting the presumption is filed with the state office of vital records;</p>

                  <p>(c) Subject to subsection (a) of this section, an acknowledgment of paternity or denial of paternity takes effect on the birth of the child or the filing of the document with the state office of vital records, whichever occurs later.</p>
                  <p>(d) An acknowledgment of paternity or denial of paternity signed by a minor and a legal guardian of the minor is valid if it is otherwise in compliance with this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Genetic testing shall be of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory accredited by:</p>
                  <p>(i) The American Association of Blood Banks, or a successor to its functions;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics, or a successor to its functions; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) An accrediting body designated by the United States secretary of health and human services.</p>
                  <p>(b) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one (1) or more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the testing is not required to be of the same kind for each individual undergoing genetic testing.</p>
                  <p>(c) Based on the ethnic or racial group of an individual, the testing laboratory shall determine the databases from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the probability of paternity. If there is disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) The individual objecting may require the testing laboratory, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the report of the test, to recalculate the probability of paternity using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the laboratory.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The individual objecting to the testing laboratory's initial choice shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) If the frequencies are not available to the testing laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Engage another testing laboratory to perform the calculations.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The testing laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question regarding which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. If available, the testing laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics for any other ethnic or racial group requested.</p>
                  <p>(d) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic testing does not rebuttably identify a man as the father of a child under W.S. 14-2-605, an individual who has been tested may be required to submit to additional genetic testing.</p>

                  <p>(a) Under this act, a man is rebuttably identified as the father of a child if the genetic testing complies with this article and the results disclose that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The man has at least a ninety-nine percent (99%) probability of paternity, using a prior probability of one-half (1/2), as calculated by using the combined paternity index obtained in the testing; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) A combined paternity index of at least one hundred (100) to one (1).</p>
                  <p>(b) A man identified under subsection (a) of this section as the father of the child may rebut the genetic testing results only by other genetic testing satisfying the requirements of this article which:</p>
                  <p>(i) Excludes the man as a genetic father of the child; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Identifies another man as the possible father of the child.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 14-2-710, if more than one (1) man is identified by genetic testing as the possible father of the child, the court shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to identify the genetic father.</p>

                  <p>(a) In all cases where paternity testing is undertaken, all genetic information, including genetic material and test results, shall be maintained only as long as an accreditation body specified in W.S. 14-2-703 requires such materials to be maintained for accreditation purposes. Thereafter, all materials shall be destroyed or returned to the individual from whom the information was obtained.</p>
                  <p>(b) No testing shall be conducted on any identifiable genetic material for purposes other than paternity determination without the written consent of the individual from whom the genetic material is obtained.</p>
                  <p>(c) All information obtained from identifiable genetic material submitted or used for determination of paternity shall be confidential and used solely for the purposes of determining paternity, unless individual identifiers are removed from the data used for purposes other than establishing paternity.</p>
                  <p>(d) For purposes of this section, "genetic information" means any information about genes, gene products or inherited characteristics that may derive from the individual or a family member, including, but not limited to, information:</p>
                  <p>(i) Regarding carrier status;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Regarding an increased likelihood of future disease or increased sensitivity to any substance;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Derived from laboratory tests that identify mutations in specific genes or chromosomes, physical medical examinations, family histories, requests for genetic services or counseling, tests of gene products and direct analysis of genes or chromosomes.</p>
                  <p>(e) Release of any information obtained in paternity testing without the written consent of the individual from whom the genetic material is obtained to anyone not directly involved in the paternity determination shall be a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both fine and imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>(f) An individual who intentionally releases an identifiable specimen of another individual for any purpose other than that relevant to the proceeding regarding parentage without a court order or the written permission of the individual who furnished the specimen commits a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both fine and imprisonment.</p>

                  <p>(a) In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a presumed father or to challenge the paternity of a child having an acknowledged father, the court may deny a motion seeking an order for genetic testing of the mother, the child and the presumed or acknowledged father if the court determines that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The conduct of the mother or the presumed or acknowledged father estops that party from denying parentage; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) It would be inequitable to disprove the father- child relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged father.</p>
                  <p>(b) In determining whether to deny a motion seeking an order for genetic testing under this section, the court shall consider the best interest of the child, including the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) The length of time between the proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the time that the presumed or acknowledged father was placed on notice that he might not be the genetic father;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The length of time during which the presumed or acknowledged father has assumed the role of father of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The facts surrounding the presumed or acknowledged father's discovery of his possible nonpaternity;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The nature of the relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged father;</p>
                  <p>(v) The age of the child;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The harm that may result to the child if presumed or acknowledged paternity is successfully disproved;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The nature of the relationship between the child and any alleged father;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The extent to which the passage of time reduces the chances of establishing the paternity of another man and a child support obligation in favor of the child; and</p>
                  <p>(ix) Other factors that may affect the equities arising from the disruption of the father-child relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged father or the chance of other harm to the child.</p>
                  <p>(c) In a proceeding involving the application of this section, a minor or incapacitated child shall be represented by a guardian ad litem.</p>
                  <p>(d) Denial of a motion seeking an order for genetic testing shall be based on clear and convincing evidence.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, a record of a genetic testing expert is admissible as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the report unless a party objects to its admission within fourteen (14) days after its receipt by the objecting party and cites specific grounds for exclusion. The admissibility of the report is not affected by whether the testing was performed:</p>
                  <p>(i) Voluntarily or pursuant to an order of the court or a child support enforcement agency; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Before or after the commencement of the proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(b) A party objecting to the results of genetic testing may call one (1) or more genetic testing experts to testify in person or by telephone, videoconference, deposition or another method approved by the court. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the party offering the testimony bears the expense for the expert testifying.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a child has a presumed, acknowledged or adjudicated father, the results of genetic testing are inadmissible to adjudicate parentage unless performed:</p>
                  <p>(i) With the consent of both the mother and the presumed, acknowledged or adjudicated father; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Pursuant to an order of the court under W.S. 14-2-702.</p>
                  <p>(d) Copies of bills for genetic testing and for prenatal and postnatal health care for the mother and child which are furnished to the adverse party not less than ten (10) days before the date of a hearing are admissible to establish:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount of the charges billed; and</p>

                  <p>(b) If an individual whose paternity is being determined declines to submit to genetic testing ordered by the court, the court for that reason may adjudicate parentage contrary to the position of that individual.</p>
                  <p>(c) Genetic testing of the mother of a child is not a condition precedent to testing the child and a man whose paternity is being determined.

                  <p>(a) The court shall apply the following rules to adjudicate the paternity of a child:</p>
                  <p>(i) The paternity of a child having a presumed, acknowledged or adjudicated father may be disproved only by admissible results of genetic testing excluding that man as the father of the child or identifying another man as the father of the child;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Unless the results of genetic testing are admitted to rebut other results of genetic testing, a man identified as the father of a child under W.S. 14-2-705 shall be adjudicated the father of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the court finds that genetic testing under W.S. 14-2-705 neither identifies nor excludes a man as the father of a child, the court may not dismiss the proceeding. In that event, the results of genetic testing, and other evidence, are admissible to adjudicate the issue of paternity;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Unless the results of genetic testing are admitted to rebut other results of genetic testing, a man excluded as the father of a child by genetic testing shall be adjudicated not to be the father of the child.</p>

                  <p>(b) An order adjudicating parentage shall identify the child by name and date of birth.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, the court may assess filing fees, reasonable attorney's fees, fees for genetic testing, necessary travel and other reasonable expenses incurred in a proceeding under this article.

                  <p>(d) The court may not assess fees, costs or expenses against the child support enforcement agency of this state or another state, except as provided by other law.</p>

Failure of the department to make a sufficient showing under this subsection shall not preclude the department from subsequently seeking recovery in any other manner authorized by law.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a determination of parentage is binding on:</p>
                  <p>(i) All signatories to an acknowledgement or denial of paternity as provided in article 5 of this act; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) All parties to an adjudication by a court acting under circumstances that satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of W.S. 20-4-142.</p>
                  <p>(b) A child is not bound by a determination of parentage under this act unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The determination was based on an unrescinded acknowledgment of paternity and the acknowledgement is consistent with the results of genetic testing;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The adjudication of parentage was based on a finding consistent with the results of genetic testing and the consistency is declared in the determination or is otherwise shown; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The child was a party or was represented in the proceeding determining parentage by an attorney representing the child's best interest.</p>
                  <p>(c) In a proceeding to dissolve a marriage, the court is deemed to have made an adjudication of the parentage of a child if the court acts under circumstances that satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of W.S. 20-4-142, and the final order:</p>
                  <p>(i) Expressly identifies a child as a "child of the marriage," "issue of the marriage," or similar words indicating that the husband is the father of the child; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provides for support of the child by the husband unless paternity is specifically disclaimed in the order.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a determination of parentage may be a defense in a subsequent proceeding seeking to adjudicate parentage by an individual who was not a party to the earlier proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(e) An adjudication of the paternity of a child issued by a court of this state or by the filing of an acknowledgment of paternity pursuant to W.S. 14-2-605 without the benefit of genetic testing, may be challenged by a party to the adjudication only if post-adjudication genetic testing proves that the adjudicated father is not the biological father of the child pursuant to W.S. 14-2-817. This section does not apply to any of the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) A paternity determination made in or by a foreign jurisdiction or a paternity determination which has been made in or by a foreign jurisdiction and registered in this state in accordance with the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A paternity determination based upon a court or administrative order of this state if the order was entered based upon blood or genetic test results which demonstrate that the alleged father was not excluded and that the probability of the alleged father's paternity was ninety-nine percent (99%) or higher.</p>
                  <p>(f) A petition for disestablishment of paternity shall be filed:</p>
                  <p>(i) In the district court in which the paternity order is filed;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In the case of an adjudication as a result of the filing of an acknowledgment of paternity pursuant to W.S. 14-2-605, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the petition shall be filed within the earlier of two (2) years after the petitioner knew or should have known that the paternity of the child was at issue or as provided in W.S. 14-2-809(b);</p>
                  <p>(iii) In the case of an adjudication issued by a court of this state, the petition shall be filed only by the mother of the child, the adjudicated father of the child, the child, if the child was a party to the adjudication, or the legal representative of any of these parties. A petition filed by an individual who is not a party to the adjudication shall be filed pursuant to W.S. 14-2-809. The petition under this paragraph shall be filed no later than two (2) years after the petitioner knew or should have known that the paternity of the child was at issue.</p>
                  <p>(g) The court shall appoint an attorney to represent the best interests of a child if the court finds that the best interests of the child is not adequately represented. In cases concerning an adjudication of paternity pursuant to subsection</p>
                  <p>(c) of this section, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the best interests of the child. In determining the best interests of the child, the court shall consider the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) The length of time between the proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the time that the adjudicated father was placed on notice that he might not be the genetic father;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The length of time during which the adjudicated father has assumed the role of the father of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The facts surrounding the adjudicated father's discovery of his possible nonpaternity;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The nature of the relationship between the child and the adjudicated father;</p>
                  <p>(v) The age of the child;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The harm that may result to the child if adjudicated paternity is successfully disproved;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The nature of the relationship between the child and any alleged father;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The extent to which the passage of time reduces the chances of establishing the paternity of another man and a child support obligation in favor of the child; and</p>
                  <p>(ix) Other factors that may affect the equities arising from the disruption of the father-child relationship between the child and the adjudicated father or the chance of other harm to the child.</p>
                  <p>(h) The court may order genetic testing pursuant to article 7 of this chapter.</p>

                  <p>(iv) That the birth records agency shall amend the child's birth certificate by removing the adjudicated father's name, if it appears thereon, and issue a new birth certificate for the child;</p>
                  <p>(v) That the adjudicated father is relieved of any and all future support obligations owed on behalf of the child from the date that the order determining that the established father is not the biological father is filed;</p>
                  <p>(vi) That any unpaid support due prior to the date the order determining that the adjudicated father is not the biological father is filed, is due and owing;</p>
                  <p>(vii) That the adjudicated father has no right to reimbursement of past child support paid to the mother, the state of Wyoming or any other assignee of child support.</p>
                  <p>(n) Participation of the Title IV-D agency in an action brought under this section shall be limited as follows:</p>

                  <p>(o) The costs of genetic testing, the fee of any guardian ad litem and all court costs shall be paid by the person bringing the action to overcome paternity unless otherwise provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(p) A man presumed to be the father of a child without adjudication of paternity may bring a proceeding to adjudicate paternity pursuant to W.S. 14-2-807.</p>

The parent or legal guardian must repeat the written consent process annually until the minor reaches the age of majority;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Present" means being physically present at the facility at which the tanning device is being used, but does not require the presence in the tanning room or booth being used;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Ultraviolet tanning device" means equipment that emits electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the air between two hundred (200) and four hundred (400) nanometers used for tanning of the skin, including, but not limited to, a sunlamp, tanning booth or tanning bed, but does not include equipment that emits ultraviolet radiation used by a health care professional in the treatment of disease or used pursuant to a prescription.</p>

                  <p>(i) Repealed by Laws 2017, ch. 179, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Receive, assess, investigate or arrange for investigation and coordinate investigation or assessment of all reports of known or suspected child abuse or neglect;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Within twenty-four (24) hours after notification of a suspected case of child abuse or neglect, initiate an investigation or assessment to verify every report. The representative of the child protective agency shall, at the initial time of contact with the individual subject to a child abuse and neglect investigation or assessment, advise the individual of the specific complaints or allegations made against the individual. A thorough investigation or assessment and report of child abuse or neglect shall be made in the manner and time prescribed by the state agency pursuant to rules and regulations adopted in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. If the child protective agency is denied reasonable access to a child by a parent or other persons and the agency deems that the best interest of the child so requires, it shall seek an appropriate court order by ex parte proceedings or other appropriate proceedings to see the child. The child protective agency shall assign a report:</p>
                  <p>(A) For investigation when allegations contained in the report indicate:</p>
                  <p>(I) That criminal charges could be filed, the child appears to be in imminent danger and it is likely the child will need to be removed from the home; or</p>
                  <p>(II) A child fatality, major injury or sexual abuse has occurred.</p>
                  <p>(B) For assessment when the report does not meet the criteria of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(iv) If the investigation or assessment discloses that abuse or neglect is present, initiate services with the family of the abused or neglected child to assist in resolving problems that lead to or caused the child abuse or neglect;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the child protective agency is able through investigation to substantiate a case of abuse or neglect, it shall notify the person suspected of causing the abuse or neglect by first class mail to his last known address of his right to request a hearing on the agency's determination for a final determination before the office of administrative hearings pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Make reasonable efforts to contact the noncustodial parent of the child and inform the parent of substantiated abuse or neglect in high risk or moderate risk cases as determined pursuant to rules and regulations of the state agency and inform the parent of any proposed action to be taken;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Cooperate, coordinate and assist with the prosecution and law enforcement agencies;</p>
                  <p>(viii) When the best interest of the child requires court action, contact the county and prosecuting attorney to initiate legal proceedings and assist the county and prosecuting attorney during the proceedings. If the county attorney elects not to bring court action the local child protective agency may petition the court for appointment of a guardian ad litem who shall act in the best interest of the child and who may petition the court to direct the county attorney to show cause why an action should not be commenced under W.S. 14-3-401 through 14-3-439;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Refer a child receiving department services who is under the age of six (6) years to the department of health, division of developmental disabilities preschool program for educational and developmental screening and assessment; and</p>
                  <p>(x) Make reasonable efforts to determine if the person responsible for the welfare of a child in a suspected case of child abuse or neglect is a member of the armed forces or if the child is enrolled in the defense enrollment eligibility reporting system of the United States department of defense.</p>
                  <p>(b) The local child protective agency may appeal an adverse determination of the office of administrative hearings.</p>

The fact a child, who is at least sixteen (16) years of age, is homeless as defined in W.S. 14-1-102(d) shall not, in and of itself, constitute a sufficient basis for reporting neglect. Female genital mutilation under W.S. 6-2-502(a)(v) when the victim is a minor shall be considered child abuse for mandatory reporting under this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a person reporting child abuse or neglect is a member of the staff of a medical or other public or private institution, school, facility or agency, he shall notify the person in charge or his designated agent as soon as possible, who is thereupon also responsible to make the report or cause the report to be made. Nothing in this subsection is intended to relieve individuals of their obligation to report on their own behalf unless a report has already been made or will be made.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any employer, public or private, who discharges, suspends, disciplines or penalizes an employee solely for making a report of neglect or abuse under W.S. 14-3-201 through 14-3-215 is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, a fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), or both.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any person who knowingly and intentionally makes a false report of child abuse or neglect, or who encourages or coerces another person to make a false report of child abuse or neglect, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, a fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), or both.</p>

                  <p>(c) Any person investigating, examining or treating suspected child abuse or neglect may document evidence of child abuse or neglect to the extent allowed by law by having photographs taken or causing x-rays to be made of the areas of trauma visible on a child who is the subject of the report or who is subject to a report. The reasonable cost of the photographs or x-rays shall be reimbursed by the appropriate local child protective agency. All photographs, x-rays or copies thereof shall be sent to the local child protective agency, admissible as evidence in any civil proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect, and shall state:</p>

Any protective order granting disclosure shall include appropriate protections against further dissemination in any form. The court may conduct an in camera review of a recorded interview prior to issuing a protective order and may impose such conditions as may be appropriate under the circumstances of the proceeding to prevent further dissemination of the recorded interview.</p>
                  <p>(j) Any person may request a central registry screen and summary report on themselves as provided by subsection (f) of this section upon payment of the fee required by subsection (f) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) A child, or any other child residing in the same household, may be taken into custody by a law enforcement officer without a warrant or court order and without the consent of the parents, guardians or others exercising temporary or permanent control over the child when:</p>
                  <p>(i) There are reasonable grounds to believe a child is abandoned, lost, suffering from illness or injury or seriously endangered by the child's surroundings and immediate custody appears to be necessary for his protection;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The child's conduct or behavior seriously endangers himself and immediate custody appears necessary; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The child is as evidenced by an examination being abused or neglected by a parent, guardian or legal custodian, a member of the parent's, guardian's or legal custodian's household or any other person known to the parent, guardian or legal custodian.</p>
                  <p>(b) A child may be taken into temporary protective custody by a physician, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner without a warrant or court order and without the consent of the parents, guardians or others exercising temporary or permanent control over the child when the physician, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner treating the child, or a hospital in which the child is being treated, finds that there is reasonable cause to believe an imminent danger to the child's life, health or safety exists unless the child is taken into protective custody, whether or not additional medical treatment is required, and there is not time to apply for a court order.</p>
                  <p>(c) A district attorney may file an emergency petition, or the department of family services, a local law enforcement officer, an administrator of a hospital in which a child reasonably believed to have been abused or neglected is being treated, or any physician, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner who treated the child may request the court for a protective order. After considering the emergency petition or request, the judge or commissioner, upon finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a child has been abused or neglected and that the child, by continuing in his place of residence or in the care and custody of the person responsible for his health, safety and welfare, would be in imminent danger of his life, health or safety, may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Issue an ex parte order or search warrant. The order shall place the child in the temporary protective custody of the local child protection agency;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Issue an emergency order or search warrant upon application and hearing, authorizing ordinary or emergency care of the child or authorizing a forensic examination to collect evidence.</p>
                  <p>(d) Temporary protective custody shall not exceed forty- eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays.</p>
                  <p>(e) When necessary for the best interest or welfare of the child in temporary protective custody, a court may order medical or other necessary health care, including mental health and substance abuse care, notwithstanding the absence of a prior finding of child abuse or neglect.</p>

                  <p>(b) Any person taking a child into temporary protective custody under this act shall as soon as possible notify the child's parent, guardian or custodian. Unless the child's shelter care is authorized by court order or required for one (1) of the reasons in subsection (a) of this section, the child shall be released to the care of his parent, guardian, custodian or other responsible adult upon that person's written promise to present the child before the court upon request.</p>

                  <p>(a) When a child is taken into temporary protective custody without a court order or under an ex parte emergency order, a petition as provided in W.S. 14-3-412 shall be promptly filed and presented to the court. A shelter care hearing shall be held as soon as reasonably possible not later than forty- eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays, after the child is taken into temporary protective custody to determine if further shelter care is required pending further court action. Written notice stating the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be given to the child and to his parents, guardian or custodian.</p>
                  <p>(b) At the commencement of the hearing the judge shall advise the child and his parents, guardian or custodian of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The contents of the petition and the nature of the allegations contained therein;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Their right to counsel as provided in W.S. 14-3-422;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses or to present witnesses and evidence in their own behalf and the right to issuance of process by the court to compel the appearance of witnesses and the production of evidence;</p>
                  <p>and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The right to a jury trial as provided in W.S. 14-3-423;</p>
                  <p>(v) The right to appeal as provided in W.S. 14-3-432;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The state's obligation, pursuant to W.S. 14-3-431(d), to file a petition to terminate parental rights when a child has been placed in foster care under the responsibility of the state for fifteen (15) months of the most recent twenty-two (22) months unless the court finds that one (1) of the exceptions listed in W.S. 14-3-431(m) applies.</p>
                  <p>(c) An initial hearing may be held in conjunction with a shelter care hearing, provided the requirements of W.S. 14-3-413, 14-3-414 and 14-3-426 have been met. The court shall set a time not to exceed sixty (60) days for an adjudicatory hearing, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing. In no case shall the court hold the adjudicatory hearing more than ninety (90) days after the date the petition is filed.</p>
                  <p>(d) The court shall determine whether or not the child's full-time shelter care is required to protect the child's welfare pending further proceedings. If the court determines that returning the child to the home is contrary to the welfare of the child, the court shall enter the finding on the record and order the child placed in the legal custody of the department of family services. If the court finds that full-time shelter care is not required, the court shall order the child released and may impose one (1) or more of the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Place the child in the custody and supervision of his parents, guardian or custodian, under the supervision of the department of family services or under the protective supervision of any individual or organization approved by the court that agrees to supervise the child; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Impose any other terms and conditions of release deemed reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the child at subsequent proceedings or necessary to his protection from harm.</p>
                  <p>(e) All relevant and material evidence helpful in determining the need for shelter care may be admitted by the court even though not competent in an adjudicatory hearing on the allegations of the petition.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a child is not released after a shelter care hearing and it appears by sworn statement of the parents, guardian or custodian that they did not receive notice and did not waive notice and appearance at the hearing, the court shall rehear the matter without delay.</p>

                  <p>(b) Within the state, service of order to appear is made by personally delivering a copy of the order together with a copy of the petition to the person ordered to appear, provided that parents of a child may both be served by personally delivering to either parent two (2) copies of the order and petition, one (1) copy for each parent. A child under the age of fourteen (14) years is served by delivering a copy of the order together with a copy of the petition to the child's parents, guardian, custodian or other adult having the actual physical custody and control of the child or to a guardian ad litem or attorney appointed for the child.</p>

The state agency having custody of the child shall also file an affidavit with the court explaining the efforts made to locate the missing parent when the address of the child's parents, guardian or custodian is unknown and cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained, and the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child and to receive service of process.</p>
                  <p>(d) Service by certified mail is complete on the date the clerk receives the return receipt signed by addressee. Personal service either within or outside the state is complete on the date when copies of the order to appear and petition are delivered to the person to be served.</p>
                  <p>(e) When personal service of order to appear is made within the state, service shall be completed not less than two (2) days before the hearing and when made outside the state, service shall be completed not less than five (5) days before the hearing. However, notwithstanding any provision within this act, the court may order that a child be taken into custody as provided in W.S. 14-3-413 or that a child be held in shelter care pending further proceedings as provided in W.S. 14-3-409, even though service of order to appear on the parents, guardian or custodian of the child is not complete at the time of making the order.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the person's residence is unknown, service may be had by constructive service or by publication as provided in the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

                  <p>(a) There shall be an initial hearing. The initial hearing may be held in conjunction with the shelter care hearing provided the requirements of W.S. 14-3-413, 14-3-414 and 14-3-426 have been met. The initial hearing may also be held after a shelter care hearing or a transfer hearing. At the initial hearing, the child and his parents, guardian or custodian shall be advised by the court of their rights under law and as provided in this act. They shall also be advised of the specific allegations in the petition and given an opportunity to admit or deny them. They shall also be advised of the possible liability for costs of treatment or services pursuant to this act. It is not necessary at the initial hearing for the district attorney to establish probable cause to believe the allegations in the petition are true. If the allegations are admitted, the court shall make the appropriate adjudication and may proceed immediately to a disposition of the case, provided the court has the predisposition report and multidisciplinary team recommendations, in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 14-3-429, except that a commissioner acting in the absence or incapacity of the judge may take testimony to establish a factual basis and accept an admission and perform all other requirements of the initial hearing but shall not proceed to disposition.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the allegations of the petition are denied, the court may, with consent of the parties, proceed immediately to hear evidence on the petition or it may set a later time not to exceed sixty (60) days for an adjudicatory hearing, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing. In no case shall the court hold the adjudicatory hearing more than ninety (90) days after the date the petition is filed. Only competent, relevant and material evidence shall be admissible at an adjudicatory hearing to determine the truth of the allegations in the petition. If after an adjudicatory hearing the court finds that the allegations in the petition are not established as required by this act, it shall dismiss the petition and order the child released from any shelter care.</p>
                  <p>(c) If after an adjudicatory hearing or a valid admission or confession the court or jury finds that a child is neglected, it shall enter a decree to that effect stating the jurisdictional facts upon which the decree is based. It may then proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing within sixty (60) days to make proper disposition of the child.</p>
                  <p>(d) In shelter care hearings or disposition hearings, all material and relevant evidence helpful in determining questions may be received by the court and relied upon for probative value. The parties or their counsel may examine and controvert written reports received as evidence and cross-examine persons making the reports.</p>
                  <p>(e) On motion of any party or on its own motion, the court may continue a disposition hearing for a reasonable time not to exceed sixty (60) days to receive reports and other evidence bearing on the disposition to be made. The court shall make an appropriate order for shelter care of the child or for his release from shelter care subject to any terms and conditions the court deems necessary during the period of continuance.</p>
                  <p>(f) At any time prior to disposition under W.S. 14-3-429, the court, on motion of any party or on its own motion, may reconsider its order regarding shelter care or conditions of release made under W.S. 14-3-409 or 14-3-414.</p>
                  <p>(g) In the absence or incapacity of the judge, the initial hearing may be conducted by a district court commissioner.</p>

For cause, which shall be set forth with specificity, the multidisciplinary team may adjust its recommendations to the court with respect to the goals or objectives in the plan to effect the return of the child to the home or to close the case. In formulating recommendations, the multidisciplinary team shall give consideration to the best interest of the child, the best interest of the family, the most appropriate and least restrictive case planning options available as well as costs of care. After each multidisciplinary team meeting, the coordinator shall prepare for submission to each member of the team and to the court a summary of the multidisciplinary team meeting specifically describing the recommendations for the court and the goals and objectives which should be met to return the child to the home or to close the case. If the recommendations for the case plan have been changed, the summary shall include a detailed explanation of the change in the recommendations and the reasons for the change.</p>
                  <p>(g) All records, reports and case planning recommendations of the multidisciplinary team are confidential except as provided by this section. Any person who willfully violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00).</p>
                  <p>(h) The court shall not consider any report or recommendation under this section prior to adjudication of the allegations in the petition without the consent of the child and the child's parents, guardian or custodian.</p>
                  <p>(j) Any member of a multidisciplinary team who cannot attend team meetings in person or by telephone may submit written reports and recommendations to the other team members and to the court. Individuals who are not members of the multidisciplinary team but have knowledge pertinent to the team's decisions may be asked to provide information to the multidisciplinary team. The individuals shall be bound by the confidentiality provisions of subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) The department shall develop a case plan for a child when there is a recommendation to place the child outside the home. If a parent chooses not to comply with or participate in the case plan developed by the department, that parent is prohibited from later objecting to or complaining about the services that were provided to the child and family.</p>
                  <p>(m) If the child is placed outside the home, the multidisciplinary team shall meet quarterly to review the child's and the family's progress toward meeting the goals or expectations in the case plan and the multidisciplinary team shall provide a written report with recommendations to the court prior to each review hearing.</p>
                  <p>(n) No later than five (5) business days prior to the dispositional hearing, the multidisciplinary team shall file with the court the multidisciplinary team report which shall include the multidisciplinary team's recommendations and the department case plan in a standard format established by the department.</p>
                  <p>(o) Five (5) business days prior to each review hearing, the multidisciplinary team shall file with the court a report updating the multidisciplinary team report, the multidisciplinary team's recommendations and the department case plan.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>14-3-428. Abeyance of proceedings by consent decree; term of decree; reinstatement of proceedings; effect of discharge or completing term.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) At any time after the filing of a petition alleging a child to be neglected and before adjudication, the court may issue a consent decree ordering further proceedings held in abeyance. The placement of the child is subject to the terms, conditions and stipulations agreed to by the parties affected in accordance with W.S. 14-3-429. The consent decree shall not be entered without the consent of the district attorney, the child's guardian ad litem and the parents. Modifications to an existing consent decree may be allowed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The consent decree shall be in writing and copies given to all parties. The decree shall include the case plan for the family.</p>
                  <p>(c) A consent decree, if the child remains within the home, shall be in force for the period agreed upon by the parties unless sooner terminated by the court.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the child is placed outside the home, a consent decree shall be in force for the period agreed upon by the parties but not longer than six (6) months unless sooner terminated by the court. For good cause the court may grant one (1) extension of the consent decree for no longer than six (6) months.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a consent decree is in effect and the child is in placement, the court shall hold review hearings as provided by W.S. 14-3-431.</p>
                  <p>(f) If prior to discharge by the court or expiration of the consent decree, the parents or guardian of a child alleged to be neglected fail to fulfill the terms and conditions of the decree or a new petition is filed alleging the child to be neglected, the original petition and proceeding may be reinstated upon order of the court after hearing, and the court may proceed as though the consent decree had never been entered. If, as part of the consent decree, the parents or guardian made an admission to any of the allegations contained in the original petition, that admission shall be entered only if the court orders that the original petition and proceeding be reinstated and the admissions, if any, be entered. If the admission is entered, the court may proceed to disposition pursuant to W.S. 14-3-426.</p>
                  <p>(g) Parties discharged by the court under a consent decree without reinstatement of the original petition and proceeding shall not thereafter be proceeded against in any court for the same misconduct alleged in the original petition except concurrent criminal allegations or charges against a person accused to have abused or neglected a child shall not be affected by a consent decree.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>14-3-429. Decree where child adjudged neglected; dispositions; terms and conditions; legal custody.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) In determining the disposition to be made under this act in regard to any child:</p>
                  <p>(i) The court shall review the predisposition report, the recommendations, if any, of the multidisciplinary team, the case plan and other reports or evaluations ordered by the court and indicate on the record what materials were considered in reaching the disposition;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the court does not place the child in accordance with the recommendations of the predisposition report or multidisciplinary team, the court shall enter on the record specific findings of fact relied upon to support its decision to deviate from the recommended disposition;</p>
                  <p>(iii) When a child is adjudged by the court to be neglected the court shall enter its decree to that effect and make a disposition as provided in this section that places the child in the least restrictive environment consistent with what is best suited to the public interest of preserving families and the physical, mental and moral welfare of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iv) When a child is adjudged to be neglected the court shall ensure that reasonable efforts were made by the department of family services to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home or to make it possible for the child to return to the child's home. Before placing a child outside of the home, the court shall find by clear and convincing evidence that to return the child to the child's home would not be in the best interest of the child despite efforts that have been made;</p>
                  <p>(v) The court shall not order an out-of-state placement unless:</p>
                  <p>(A) Evidence has been presented to the court regarding the costs of the out-of-state placement being ordered together with evidence of the comparative costs of any suitable alternative in-state treatment program or facility, as determined by the department of family services pursuant to W.S. 21-13-315(d)(vii), whether or not placement in the in-state program or facility is currently available;</p>
                  <p>(B) The court makes an affirmative finding on the record that no placement can be made in a Wyoming institution or in a private residential treatment facility or group home located in Wyoming that can provide adequate treatment or services for the child; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The court states on the record why no in-state placement is available.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the child is found to be neglected the court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Permit the child to remain in the legal custody of his parents, guardian or custodian without protective supervision, subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the court;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Place the child under protective supervision;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Transfer temporary legal custody to a relative or other suitable adult the court finds qualified to receive and care for the child, with or without supervision, subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the court;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Transfer temporary legal custody to the department of family services or a state or local public agency responsible for the care and placement of neglected children, provided the child shall not be committed to the Wyoming boys' school, the Wyoming girls' school or the Wyoming state hospital.</p>
                  <p>(c) In cases where a child is ordered removed from the child's home:</p>
                  <p>(i) If a child is committed or transferred to an agency or institution under this section, at least every three (3) months the agency or institution shall recommend to the court if the order should be continued;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The court shall order the parents or other legally obligated person to pay a reasonable sum for the support and treatment of the child as required by W.S. 14-3-435, or shall state on the record the reasons why an order for support was not entered;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In cases where the child is placed in custody of the department, support shall be established by the department through a separate civil action;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Any order regarding potential placement at a psychiatric residential treatment facility shall not specify a particular psychiatric residential treatment facility or level of care for the placement of the child;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the child is placed in a qualified residential treatment program:</p>
                  <p>(A) Within thirty (30) days of the placement a qualified individual shall conduct an assessment to determine whether the child's needs can be met through placement with family members or in a foster family home, or if the placement in a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment consistent with short-term and long-term goals of the child and the child's permanency plan;</p>
                  <p>(B) Within sixty (60) days of the placement the court shall:</p>
                  <p>(I) Consider the assessment completed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(II) Determine whether the child's needs can be met through placement in a foster family home or whether the placement in a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment;</p>
                  <p>(III) Determine whether the placement is consistent with short-term and long-term goals of the child, as specified in the child's permanency plan;</p>
                  <p>(IV) Approve or disapprove the placement.</p>
                  <p>(d) As a part of any order of disposition and the terms and conditions thereof, the court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Impose any demands, requirements, limitations, restrictions or restraints on the child, and do all things with regard to the child that his parents might reasonably and lawfully do under similar circumstances;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Order the child, or his parents, or both, to undergo evaluation and indicated treatment or another program designed to address problems which contributed to the adjudication. A parent who willfully violates or neglects or refuses to comply with any order of the court may be found in contempt and punished as provided by W.S. 14-3-438;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Require the child's parents or guardian to attend a parenting class or other appropriate education or treatment designed to address problems which contributed to the adjudication and to pay all or part of the cost of the class, education or treatment in accordance with the court's determination of their ability to pay;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Require the child's parents or guardian and the child to participate in a court supervised treatment program qualified under W.S. 7-13-1601 through 7-13-1615, provided the court supervised treatment program accepts the child's parents or guardian and the child for participation in its program.</p>
                  <p>(e) An institution, organization or agency vested with legal custody of a child by court order shall have the right to determine where and with whom the child shall live, provided that placement of the child does not remove him from the state of Wyoming without court authorization. An individual vested with legal custody of a child by court order shall personally exercise custodial rights and responsibilities unless otherwise authorized by the court.</p>
                  <p>(f) Whenever the court vests legal custody of a child in an institution, organization or agency it shall transmit with the order copies of all clinical reports, social studies and other information pertinent to the care and treatment of the child. The institution, organization or agency receiving legal custody of a child shall provide the court with any information concerning the child that the court may request.</p>
                  <p>(g) In placing a child in the custody of an individual or a private agency or institution, the court shall give primary consideration to the needs and welfare of the child. Where a choice of equivalent services exists, the court shall, whenever practicable, select a person or an agency or institution governed by persons of the same religion as that of the parents of the child. In case of a difference in the religious faith of the parents, then the court shall select the person, agency or institution governed by persons of the religious faith of the child, or if the religious faith of the child is not ascertainable, then of the faith of either parent.</p>
                  <p>(h) Absent a specific provision in the placement order requiring prior court approval for any change in placement, a department of state government vested with temporary legal custody of a child by court order under this section has authority to place the child in a residential facility or other out-of-home placement of similar or less restrictive confinement provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) At least ten (10) days prior to the change in placement written notice of the proposed placement is served upon the child, the child's parents, the child's representative, the current placement provider and the office of the district attorney of original jurisdiction, personally or by certified mail to the recipient's last known address; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) None of the parties within ten (10) days after notice is filed with the juvenile court having jurisdiction, makes a written objection to the proposed change in placement.</p>
                  <p>(j) If a placement order vesting a department of state government with temporary legal custody of a child under this section includes a provision that court approval shall be required prior to any change in placement, the department may proceed to place the child in a residential facility or other out-of-home placement of similar or less restrictive confinement, and the court shall be deemed to have approved such change in placement, if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The conditions of paragraphs (h)(i) and (ii) of this section are met; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The court on its own motion does not set the matter for hearing within fifteen (15) days after notice of the proposed change in placement is filed with the juvenile court.</p>

                  <p>(a) On application of any party to the proceedings or on its own motion the court may make an order of protection in support of the decree and order of disposition, restraining or otherwise controlling the conduct of the child's parents, guardian or custodian or any party to the proceeding whom the court finds to be encouraging, causing or contributing to the acts or conditions which bring the child within the provisions of this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The order of protection may require the person against whom it is directed to do or to refrain from doing any acts required or forbidden by law and necessary for the welfare of the child and the enforcement of the order of disposition, including the following requirements to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Perform any legal obligation of support;</p>

                  <p>(a) An order of disposition shall remain in force for an indefinite period until terminated by the court whenever it appears the purpose of the order has been achieved and it is in the child's best interest that he be discharged from further court jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless sooner terminated by court order, all orders issued under this act shall terminate with respect to a child adjudicated neglected, when he reaches eighteen (18) years of age unless the court has ordered care or services to continue beyond that time. The court shall conduct a review hearing at least six (6) months before the child reaches eighteen (18) years of age to determine whether care or transitional services should continue and for what period of time prior to the individual reaching the age of twenty-one (21) years.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court shall conduct a review hearing six (6) months from the date of the child's removal from the home and every six (6) months thereafter.

                  <p>(ii) The continuing necessity for the placement;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The appropriateness of the current placement;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The reasonableness of efforts made to reunify the family and the consistency of those efforts with the case plan;</p>
                  <p>(v) The appropriateness of the case plan and the extent of compliance with the case plan including the permanent placement of the child;</p>

                  <p>(d) The court shall conduct a permanency hearing no later than twelve (12) months from the date of the child's removal from the home and not less than once every twelve (12) months thereafter if the child remains in out-of-home placement or more frequently as deemed necessary by the court.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the court determines as provided in W.S. 14-2-309(a)(vi), (b) or (c) that reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify the family are not required, a permanency hearing shall be held for the child within thirty (30) days after the determination.</p>

                  <p>(h) The permanency hearing may be combined with a hearing required by other sections of this chapter if the hearing is held within twelve (12) months from the date of the child's removal from the home. If a permanency hearing is combined with another hearing, the requirements of the court related to the disposition of the other hearing shall be met in addition to the requirements of this section.</p>

                  <p>(A) Information to show that ongoing assessment of the child's strengths and needs continues to support the determination that placement in a qualified residential treatment program provides the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment consistent with the short-term and long-term goals of the child and the child's permanency plan;</p>
                  <p>(B) The specific treatment needs that will be met for the child in the placement;</p>

                  <p>(i) Determine whether the permanency plan is in the best interest of the child and whether the department of family services has made reasonable efforts to finalize the plan;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Order the department of family services to take any additional steps necessary to effectuate the terms of the permanency plan;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Ask the child about his desired permanency outcome if it is determined that the child should be present at the hearing;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Ask the child's guardian ad litem or other legal representative about the child's desired permanency outcome if it is determined inappropriate for the child to be present at the hearing;</p>

                  <p>(A) Make a judicial determination and explain why, as of the date of the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Provide reasons why it continues not to be in the best interest of the child to return home or be placed for adoption or with a legal guardian or a fit and willing relative for purposes of guardianship or adoption.</p>
                  <p>(vi) Require that the child be provided, to the greatest extent possible, the opportunity to participate in age appropriate or developmentally appropriate activities and experiences as defined in W.S. 14-13-101(a)(i) to promote healthy child and adolescent development consistent with W.S. 14-13-101 through 14-13-104.</p>
                  <p>(m) When a child has been placed in foster care under the responsibility of the state for fifteen (15) of the most recent twenty-two (22) months the state shall file a petition to terminate parental rights or seek to be joined as a party to the petition if a petition has been filed by another party, unless:</p>

                  <p>(a) When legal custody of a child, other than temporary guardianship, is vested by court order in an individual, agency, institution or organization other than the child's parents, the court shall in the same or any subsequent proceeding inquire into the financial condition of the child's parents or any other person who may be legally obligated to support the child. After due notice and hearing the court shall order the parents or any other legally obligated person to pay a reasonable sum for the support and treatment of the child during the time that a dispositional order is in force. The requirements of W.S. 20-2-101 through 20-2-406 apply to this section. The amount of support shall be determined in accordance with the presumptive child support established by W.S. 20-2-304. In any case where the court has deviated from the presumptive child support, the reasons therefor shall be specifically set forth in the order. The amount ordered to be paid shall be paid to the clerk of the juvenile court for transmission to the person, institution or agency having legal custody of the child or to whom compensation is due. The clerk of court is authorized to receive periodic payments payable in the name or for the benefit of the child, including but not limited to social security, veteran's administration benefits or insurance annuities, and apply the payments as the court directs. An order for support under this subsection shall include a statement of the addresses and social security numbers if known, of each obligor, the names and addresses of each obligor's employer and the names and birth dates of each child to whom the order relates. The court shall order each obligor to notify the clerk of court in writing within fifteen (15) days of any change in address or employment. If any person who is legally obligated to support the child does not have full time employment, the court may require that person to seek full time employment and may require community service work in lieu of payment until full time employment is obtained.</p>
                  <p>(b) An order for the payment of money entered against a parent or other person legally obligated to support a child under the provisions of W.S. 14-3-434, 20-2-101 through 20-2-406 or this section shall be entered separately from the decree of disposition under W.S. 14-3-429 and shall not be treated as a part of the confidential court record under W.S. 14-3-437. The order may be filed in the district court of any county in the state. From the time of filing, the order shall have the same effect as a judgment or decree of the district court in a civil action and may be enforced by the district attorney, or the department of family services in the same manner and with the same powers as in other child support cases under W.S. 20-2-303, 20-2-304, 20-2-307, 20-2-311, 20-2-401 through 20-2-406 and 20-6-101 through 20-6-222, or in any manner provided by law for enforcement of a civil judgment for money.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>14-5-101. Compact provisions generally.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in form substantially as follows:</p>
                <p>Article I</p>
                <p>Definitions</p>
                <p>As used in this compact:</p>
                <p>(a) "Child" means a person who, by reason of minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship or similar control.</p>
                <p>(b) "Sending agency" means a party state, or officer or employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association, charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings, or causes to be sent or brought any child to another party state.</p>
                <p>(c) "Receiving state" means the state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for placement with state or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or persons.</p>
                <p>(d) "Placement" means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character, or a hospital or other medical facility.</p>
                <p>Article II</p>
                <p>Conditions for Placement</p>
                <p>(a) No sending state shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.</p>
                <p>(b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:</p>
                <p>(1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.</p>
                <p>(2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.</p>
                <p>(3) The name and address of the person, agency or institutions to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring, or place the child.</p>
                <p>(4) A full statement of the reasons for such proposed action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is proposed to be made.</p>
                <p>(c) Any public officer or agency in a receiving state which is in receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this article may request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or agency of or in the sending agency's state, and shall be entitled to receive therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it may deem necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose and policy of this compact.</p>
                <p>(d) The child shall not be sent, brought or caused to be sent or brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state shall notify the sending agency, in writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child, or in violation of the law of the receiving state.</p>
                <p>Article III</p>
                <p>Penalty for Illegal Placement</p>
                <p>The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.</p>
                <p>Article IV</p>
                <p>Retention of Jurisdiction</p>
                <p>(a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency's state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.</p>
                <p>(b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.</p>
                <p>(c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.</p>
                <p>Article V</p>
                <p>Institutional Care of Delinquent Children</p>
                <p>A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to his being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that:</p>
                <p>1. Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency's jurisdiction; and 2. Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.</p>
                <p>Article VI.</p>
                <p>Compact Administrator.</p>
                <p>The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this compact shall designate an officer who shall be general coordinator of activities under this compact in his jurisdiction and who, acting jointly with like officers or other party jurisdictions, shall have power to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.</p>
                <p>Article VII</p>
                <p>Limitations</p>
                <p>This compact shall not apply to:</p>
                <p>(a) The sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state by his parents, step-parent, grandparent, adult brother or sister, adult uncle or aunt, or his guardian or the leaving of the child with any such relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state.</p>
                <p>(b) Any placement, sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which both the state from which the child is sent or brought and the receiving state are party, or to any other agreement between said states which has the force of law.</p>
                <p>Article VIII</p>
                <p>Enactment and Withdrawal</p>
                <p>This compact shall be open to joinder by any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and with the consent of congress, the government of Canada or any province thereof. It shall become effective with respect to any such jurisdiction when such jurisdiction has enacted the same into law. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until two (2) years after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a party state shall not affect the rights, duties and obligations under this compact of any sending agency therein with respect to a placement made prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
                <p>Article IX</p>
                <p>Construction and Severability</p>
                <p>The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>14-6-102. Interstate Compact for Juveniles; compact provisions generally.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I PURPOSE</p>
                  <p>(a) The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</p>
                  <p>(b) It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;</p>
                  <p>(v) Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;</p>
                  <p>(x) Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.</p>

The commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, and any additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) The interstate commission shall consist of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state and in consultation with the state council for interstate juvenile supervision created hereunder.

                  <p>(c) In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the interstate commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners, but who are members of interested organizations. The noncommissioner members shall include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general, Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials and crime victims.

                  <p>ARTICLE VI</p>
                  <p>RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</p>
                  <p>(a) The interstate commission shall promulgate and publish rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. The rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the "Model State Administrative Procedures Act," 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000), or another administrative procedures act, as the interstate commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the United States Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) When promulgating a rule, the interstate commission shall, at a minimum:</p>
                  <p>(i) Publish the proposed rule's entire text stating the reason for that proposed rule;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Allow and invite any person to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be added to the record and be made publicly available;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide an opportunity for an informal hearing if petitioned by ten (10) or more persons; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on input from state or local officials or interested parties.</p>
                  <p>(d) Allow, not later than sixty (60) days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person to file a petition in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district court where the interstate commission's principal office is located for judicial review of the rule. If the court finds that the interstate commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that the rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</p>
                  <p>(f) The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superceded by this act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first meeting of the interstate commission created hereunder.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon determination by the interstate commission that a state-of-emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the emergency rule.</p>

The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall be received by all the judges, public officers, commissions and departments of the state government as evidence of the authorized statute and administrative rules. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission, it shall be entitled to receive all service of process in the proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.</p>

                  <p>(b) The interstate commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff which shall be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, taking into consideration the population of each compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of juveniles in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs the assessment.</p>
                  <p>(c) The interstate commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the interstate commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.

                  <p>ARTICLE IX THE STATE COUNCIL Each member state shall create a state council for interstate juvenile supervision.

                  <p>The board of judicial policy and administration shall appoint one (1) member.

The state council shall appoint the compact administrator and may appoint a deputy compact administrator who shall be members of the council and whose terms shall be concurrent with the council members. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator or deputy compact administrator. Each state council will advise and may exercise oversight and advocacy concerning that state's participation in interstate commission activities and other duties as may be determined by that state, including but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE X</p>

Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the interstate commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.</p>
                  <p>(c) The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XI</p>
                  <p>WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT</p>
                  <p>Section A. Withdrawal</p>
                  <p>(a) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each compacting state, provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.</p>
                  <p>(b) The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.</p>
                  <p>(c) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof.</p>
                  <p>(d) The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>(e) Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon a later date as determined by the interstate commission.</p>
                  <p>Section B. Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination and Default</p>
                  <p>(a) If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or duly promulgated rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:</p>
                  <p>(i) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Alternative dispute resolution;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Fines, fees and costs in amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the interstate commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or the chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform the obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state shall cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council of the termination.</p>
                  <p>(c) The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
                  <p>(d) The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
                  <p>(e) Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.</p>
                  <p>Section C. Judicial Enforcement The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees.</p>
                  <p>Section D. Dissolution of Compact</p>
                  <p>(a) The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting states, which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XII SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION</p>
                  <p>(a) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.</p>
                  <p>(b) The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE XIII</p>
                  <p>BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS</p>
                  <p>Section A. Other Laws</p>
                  <p>(a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.</p>
                  <p>(b) All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</p>
                  <p>Section B. Binding Effect of the Compact</p>
                  <p>(a) All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.</p>
                  <p>(b) All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation.</p>
                  <p>(d) In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by the provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.</p>

                  <p>(B) To remove, where appropriate, the taint of criminality from children committing certain unlawful acts; and</p>
                  <p>(C) To provide treatment, training and rehabilitation that emphasizes the accountability and responsibility of both the parent and the child for the child's conduct, reduces recidivism and helps children to become functioning and contributing adults.</p>

                  <p>(vi) To provide a simple judicial procedure through which the provisions of this act are executed and enforced and in which the parties are assured a fair and timely hearing and their constitutional and other legal rights recognized and enforced.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>14-6-209. Taking of child into custody; informal hearing where no court order; conditional release; evidence; rehearing.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) When a child is placed in detention or shelter care without a court order, a petition as provided in W.S. 14-6-212 shall be promptly filed and presented to the court. An informal detention or shelter care hearing shall be held as soon as reasonably possible not later than forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays, after the child is taken into custody to determine if further detention or shelter care is required pending further court action. The child shall be interviewed by the department or its designee prior to the detention or shelter care hearing, but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours, excluding weekends and legal holidays, after the child is taken into custody. The department or its designee shall submit a written report of the interview to the court, including an assessment of the immediate needs of the child and a recommendation for the most appropriate placement for the child pending disposition of the violation. Written notice stating the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be given to the child and to his parents, guardian or custodian.</p>
                  <p>(b) At the commencement of the hearing the judge shall advise the child and his parents, guardian or custodian of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The contents of the petition and the nature of the charges or allegations contained therein;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Their right to counsel as provided in W.S. 14-6-222;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The child's right to remain silent with respect to any allegations of a delinquent act;</p>

                  <p>(v) The right to a jury trial as provided in W.S. 14-6-223;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The right to appeal as provided in W.S. 14-6-233; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) All other rights afforded a criminal defendant.</p>
                  <p>(c) The child shall be given an opportunity to admit or deny the allegations in the petition. If the allegations are admitted, the court shall make the appropriate adjudication and may proceed immediately to a disposition of the case, provided the court has the predisposition report and multidisciplinary team recommendations, in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 14-6-229, except that a commissioner acting in the absence or incapacity of the judge may take testimony to establish a factual basis and accept an admission and perform all other requirements of the initial hearing but shall not proceed to disposition. If denied, the court shall set a time not to exceed sixty (60) days for an adjudicatory hearing or a transfer hearing, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing. In no case shall the court hold the adjudicatory hearing more than ninety (90) days after the date the petition is filed.</p>
                  <p>(d) Regardless of whether the allegations in the petition are admitted or denied, the court shall determine whether or not the child's full-time detention or shelter care is required pending further proceedings. If the court finds that returning the child to the home is contrary to the welfare of the child, the court shall enter the finding on the record and order the child placed in the legal custody of the department. The court shall explain the terms of the court order to the child, his parents or legal guardian and any other person the court deems necessary. If the court finds that full-time detention or shelter care is not required, the court shall order the child released and may impose one (1) or more of the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(i) Place the child in the custody and supervision of his parents, guardian or custodian, under the protective supervision of the department or a county or state probation officer or under the supervision of any individual or organization approved by the court that agrees to supervise the child;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Place restrictions on the child's travel, associates, activities or place of abode during the period of his release, including a requirement that the child return to the physical custody of his parents, guardian or custodian at specified hours; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Impose any other terms and conditions of release deemed reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the child at subsequent proceedings.</p>
                  <p>(e) All relevant and material evidence helpful in determining the need for detention or shelter care may be admitted by the court even though not competent in an adjudicatory hearing on the allegations of the petition.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a child is not released after a detention or shelter care hearing and it appears by sworn statement of the parents, guardian or custodian that they did not receive notice and did not waive notice and appearance at the hearing, the court shall rehear the matter without delay.</p>

The hearing shall be conducted in the presence of counsel and guardian ad litem, if so appointed. The commissioner may also appoint counsel, appoint a guardian ad litem, order a predisposition report, appoint a multidisciplinary team, issue subpoenas or search warrants, order physical or medical examinations and authorize emergency medical, surgical or dental treatment all as provided in this act.

                  <p>(a) In proceedings under this act, service of order to appear or other process within the state shall be made by the sheriff of the county where service is made, by his undersheriff or deputy or by any law enforcement officer or responsible adult not a party to the proceeding and appointed by the clerk.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within the state, service of order to appear is made by personally delivering a copy of the order together with a copy of the petition to the person ordered to appear, provided that parents of a child may both be served by personally delivering to either parent two (2) copies of the order and petition, one (1) copy for each parent. A child under the age of fourteen (14) years is served by delivering a copy of the order together with a copy of the petition to the child's parents, guardian, custodian or other adult having the actual physical custody and control of the child or to a guardian ad litem or attorney appointed for the child.</p>
                  <p>(c) If it appears to the court by affidavit that the parents, guardian or custodian of the child cannot be found within the state, the court may order personal service outside the state or service by certified mail with return receipt requested signed by addressee only. If the address of the child's parents, guardian or custodian is unknown and cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child and to receive service of process.</p>
                  <p>(d) Service by certified mail is complete on the date the clerk receives the return receipt signed by addressee. Personal service either within or outside the state is complete on the date when copies of the order to appear and petition are delivered to the person to be served.</p>
                  <p>(e) When personal service of order to appear is made within the state, service shall be completed not less than two (2) days before the hearing and when made outside the state, service shall be completed not less than five (5) days before the hearing. However, notwithstanding any provision within this act, the court may order that a child be taken into custody as provided in W.S. 14-6-213 or that a child be held in detention or shelter care pending further proceedings as provided in W.S. 14-6-209, even though service of order to appear on the parents, guardian or custodian of the child is not complete at the time of making the order.</p>

                  <p>(a) The court or a commissioner may issue a search warrant within the court's jurisdiction if it appears by application supported by affidavit of one (1) or more adults that there is probable cause to believe a child has committed a delinquent act and the child is in hiding to avoid service of process or being taken into custody, or it appears by application supported by affidavit of one (1) or more adults that there is probable cause to believe a child has committed a delinquent act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The affidavit shall be in writing, signed and affirmed by the affiant. The affidavit shall set forth:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and age of the child sought, provided that if the name or age of the child is unknown the affidavit shall set forth a description of the child sufficient to identify him with reasonable certainty and a statement that the affiant believes the child is of age to come within the provisions of this act; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The affiant's belief that the child sought has committed a delinquent act and is in hiding to avoid service of process or being taken into custody, and a statement of the facts upon which the belief is based.</p>

                  <p>(c) The warrant may be directed to any law enforcement officer of the county or municipality in which the place or premises to be searched is located. The warrant shall:</p>

                  <p>(a) Any time after the filing of a petition, on motion of the district attorney or the child's parents, guardian, custodian or attorney or on motion of the court, the court may order the child to be examined by a licensed and qualified physician, surgeon, psychiatrist or psychologist designated by the court to aid in determining the physical and mental condition of the child. The examination shall be conducted on an outpatient basis, but the court may commit the child to a suitable medical facility or institution for examination if deemed necessary. Commitment for examination shall not exceed fifteen (15) days. Any time after the filing of a petition, the court on its own motion or motion of the district attorney or the child's parents, guardian, custodian or attorney, may order the child's parents, guardians or other custodial members of the child's family to undergo a substance abuse assessment at the expense of the child's parents, guardians or other custodial members of the child's family and to fully comply with all findings and recommendations set forth in the assessment. Failure to comply may result in contempt proceedings as set forth in W.S. 14-6-242.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a child has been committed to a medical facility or institution for mental examination prior to adjudication of the petition and if it appears to the court from the mental examination that the child is competent to participate in further proceedings and is not suffering from mental illness or intellectual disability to a degree rendering the child subject to involuntary commitment to the Wyoming state hospital or the Wyoming life resource center, the court shall order the child returned to the court without delay.</p>
                  <p>(c) If it appears to the court by mental examination conducted before adjudication of the petition that a child alleged to be delinquent is incompetent to participate in further proceedings by reason of mental illness or intellectual disability to a degree rendering the child subject to involuntary commitment to the Wyoming state hospital or the Wyoming life resource center, the court shall hold further proceedings under this act in abeyance. The district attorney shall then commence proceedings in the district court for commitment of the child to the appropriate institution as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(d) The juvenile court shall retain jurisdiction of the child on the petition pending final determination of the commitment proceedings in the district court. If proceedings in the district court commit the child to the Wyoming state hospital, the Wyoming life resource center or any other facility or institution for treatment and care of people with a mental illness or an intellectual disability, the petition shall be dismissed and further proceedings under this act terminate. If proceedings in the district court determine the child does not have a mental illness or an intellectual disability to a degree rendering him subject to involuntary commitment, the court shall proceed to a final adjudication of the petition and disposition of the child under the provisions of this act.</p>

                  <p>(b) The court shall upon request appoint counsel who may be the guardian ad litem to represent the child if the child, his parents, guardian, custodian or other person responsible for the child's support are unable to obtain counsel. If appointment of counsel is requested, the court shall require the child and his parents, guardian, custodian or other person legally responsible for the child's support to verify their financial condition under oath, either by written affidavit signed and sworn to by the parties or by sworn testimony made a part of the record of the proceedings. The affidavit or sworn testimony shall state they are without sufficient money, property, assets or credit to employ counsel in their own behalf. The court may require further verification of financial condition if it deems necessary. If the child requests counsel and his parents, guardian, custodian or other person responsible for the child's support is able but unwilling to obtain counsel for the child, the court shall appoint counsel to represent the child and may direct reimbursement of counsel fees under W.S. 14-6-235(c).</p>
                  <p>(c) The court may appoint counsel for any party when necessary in the interest of justice.</p>

                  <p>(a) At their initial hearing, which may be held after a detention or shelter care hearing or a transfer hearing, the child and his parents, guardian or custodian shall be advised by the court of their rights under law and as provided in this act. They shall also be advised of the specific allegations in the petition and given an opportunity to admit or deny them, unless motion is made to the court to transfer the allegations of delinquency against the minor to another court. They shall also be advised of the possible liability for costs of treatment or services pursuant to this act or W.S. 25-11-101 through 25-11-108. It is not necessary at the initial appearance for the district attorney to establish probable cause to believe the allegations in the petition are true. When a detention or shelter care hearing is held in accordance with W.S. 14-6-209, a separate initial hearing is not required if the child and his parents, guardian or custodian were present at the detention or shelter care hearing and advised by the court as provided in this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the allegations of the petition are denied, the court may, with consent of the parties, proceed immediately to hear evidence on the petition or it may set a later time not to exceed sixty (60) days for an adjudicatory or a transfer hearing, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing. In no case shall the court hold the adjudicatory hearing more than ninety (90) days after the date the petition is filed. Only competent, relevant and material evidence shall be admissible at an adjudicatory hearing to determine the truth of the allegations in the petition. If after an adjudicatory hearing the court finds that the allegations in the petition are not established as required by this act, it shall dismiss the petition and order the child released from any detention or shelter care.</p>
                  <p>(c) If after an adjudicatory hearing or a valid admission or confession the court or jury finds that a child committed the acts alleging him delinquent, it shall enter a decree to that effect stating the jurisdictional facts upon which the decree is based. It may then proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing within sixty (60) days to make proper disposition of the child, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(d) In detention or shelter care hearings, disposition hearings or transfer hearings, all material and relevant evidence helpful in determining questions may be received by the court and relied upon for probative value. The parties or their counsel may examine and controvert written reports received as evidence and cross-examine persons making the reports.</p>
                  <p>(e) On motion of any party or on its own motion, the court may continue a disposition hearing for a reasonable time not to exceed sixty (60) days to receive reports and other evidence bearing on the disposition to be made. The court shall make an appropriate order for detention or shelter care of the child or for his release from detention or shelter care subject to any terms and conditions the court deems necessary during the period of continuance.</p>
                  <p>(f) At any time prior to disposition under W.S. 14-6-229, the court, on motion of any party or on its own motion, may reconsider its order regarding detention, shelter care or conditions of release made under W.S. 14-6-209(d) or 14-6-214(e).</p>

                  <p>(a) At any time after the filing of a petition alleging a child delinquent and before adjudication, the court may issue a consent decree ordering further proceedings held in abeyance and place a delinquent child under the supervision of a probation officer. The placement of the child is subject to the terms, conditions and stipulations agreed to by the parties affected. The consent decree shall not be entered without the consent of the district attorney, the child's attorney, where applicable, and the child and the notification of the parents. Modifications to an existing consent decree may be allowed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The consent decree shall be in writing and copies given to each of the parties. The decree shall include the case plan for the child.</p>
                  <p>(c) A consent decree shall be in force for the period agreed upon by the parties but not longer than one (1) year unless the child is sooner discharged by the court.</p>
                  <p>(d) If prior to discharge by the court or expiration of the consent decree, a child alleged to be delinquent fails to fulfill the terms and conditions of the decree or a new petition is filed alleging the child delinquent because of misconduct occurring during the term of the consent decree, the original petition and proceedings may be reinstated upon order of the court after hearing and the matter may proceed as though the consent decree had never been entered. If, as part of the consent decree, the child made an admission to any of the allegations contained in the original petition, that admission shall be entered only if the court orders that the original petition and proceeding be reinstated and the admissions, if any, be entered. If the admission is entered, the court may proceed to disposition pursuant to W.S. 14-6-226.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a consent decree is in effect and the child is in placement, the court shall hold a six (6) month and twelve (12) month review under W.S. 14-6-229.</p>
                  <p>(f) A child discharged by the court under a consent decree without reinstatement of the original petition and proceeding shall not thereafter be proceeded against in any court for the same offense or misconduct alleged in the original petition.</p>

                  <p>(ii) If the court does not place the child in accordance with the recommendations of the predisposition report or multidisciplinary team, the court shall enter on the record specific findings of fact relied upon to support its decision to deviate from the recommended disposition;</p>
                  <p>(iii) When a child is adjudged by the court to be delinquent, the court shall enter its decree to that effect and make a disposition consistent with the purposes of this act;</p>

                  <p>(B) The court makes an affirmative finding on the record that no placement can be made in a Wyoming institution or in a private residential treatment facility or group home located in Wyoming that can provide adequate treatment or services for the child; and</p>

                  <p>(a) There is no fee for filing a petition under this act nor shall any state, county or local law enforcement officer charge a fee for service of process under this act. Witness fees, juror fees and travel expenses in the amounts allowable by law may be paid to persons other than the parties who are subpoenaed or required to appear at any hearing pursuant to this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The following costs and expenses, when approved and certified by the court to the county treasurer, shall be a charge upon the funds of the county where the proceedings are held and shall be paid by the board of county commissioners of that county:</p>

                  <p>(v) Reasonable compensation for services and costs of counsel appointed by the court;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Reasonable compensation for services and costs of a guardian ad litem appointed by the court, unless the county participates in the guardian ad litem program pursuant to W.S. 14-12-101 through 14-12-104 and the program was appointed to provide the guardian ad litem; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Any other costs of the proceedings which would be assessable as costs in the district court.</p>
                  <p>(c) Legal services rendered to a child for his benefit and protection are necessities which the child's parents or any person obligated by law for the child's support may be held responsible. In every case in which a guardian ad litem has been appointed to represent the child under W.S. 14-6-216 or in which counsel has been appointed under W.S. 14-6-222 to represent the child, the child's parents, guardian or other person responsible for the child's support, the court shall determine whether the child, the child's parents, guardian or other person responsible for the child's support is able to pay part or all of the costs of representation and shall enter specific findings on the record. If the court determines that any of the parties is able to pay any amount as reimbursement for costs of representation, the court shall order reimbursement or shall state on the record the reasons why reimbursement was not ordered. The court may also in any case order that all or any part of the costs and expenses enumerated in paragraphs (b)(i), (iii), (iv) and (vii) of this section, be reimbursed to the county by the child, his parents or any person legally obligated for his support, or any of them jointly and severally, upon terms the court may direct. An order for reimbursement of costs made pursuant to this subsection may be enforced as provided in W.S. 14-6-236. Any reimbursement ordered for guardian ad litem services provided pursuant to W.S. 14-12-101 through 14-12-104 shall be apportioned between the county and the guardian ad litem program in accordance with payments made for those services.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department of family services shall promulgate rules and regulations establishing a standard fee schedule for probation services provided under this act. In every case in which a child has been placed on probation under W.S. 14-6-229(d), the court shall determine whether the child, the child's parents, guardian or other person legally obligated for the child's support is able to pay part or all of the expenses of probation determined in accordance with the department's fee schedule and shall enter specific findings on the record. If the court determines that any of the parties is able to pay any amount as reimbursement for expenses of probation, the court shall order reimbursement by any or all of the parties, jointly and severally, or shall state on the record the reasons why reimbursement was not ordered. An order for reimbursement of expenses made pursuant to this subsection may be enforced as provided in W.S. 14-6-236.</p>

                  <p>(a) When legal custody of a child, other than temporary guardianship, is vested by court order in an individual, agency, institution or organization other than the child's parents, the court shall in the same proceeding inquire into the financial condition of the child's parents or any other person who may be legally obligated to support the child. After due notice and hearing the court shall order the parents or any other legally obligated person to pay a reasonable sum for the support and treatment of the child during the time that a dispositional order is in force. The requirements of W.S. 20-2-101 through 20-2-406 apply to this section. The amount of support shall be determined in accordance with the presumptive child support established by W.S. 20-2-304. In any case where the court has deviated from the presumptive child support, the reasons therefor shall be specifically set forth in the order. The amount ordered to be paid shall be paid to the clerk of the district court for transmission to the person, institution or agency having legal custody of the child or to whom compensation is due. The clerk of court is authorized to receive periodic payments payable in the name or for the benefit of the child, including but not limited to social security, veteran's administration benefits or insurance annuities, and apply the payments as the court directs. An order for support under this subsection shall include a statement of the addresses and social security numbers if known, of each obligor, the names and addresses of each obligor's employer and the names and birthdates of each child to whom the order relates. The court shall order each obligor to notify the clerk of court in writing within fifteen (15) days of any change in address or employment. If any person who is legally obligated to support the child does not have full time employment, the court may require that person to seek full time employment and may require community service work in lieu of payment until full time employment is obtained.</p>
                  <p>(b) An order for the payment of money entered against a parent or other person legally obligated to support a child under the provisions of W.S. 14-6-235, 20-2-101 through 20-2-406 or this section shall be entered separately from the decree of disposition under W.S. 14-6-229 and shall not be treated as a part of the confidential court record under W.S. 14-6-239. The order may be filed in the district court of any county in the state. From the time of filing, the order shall have the same effect as a judgment or decree of the district court in a civil action and may be enforced by the district attorney, or the department of family services in the same manner and with the same powers as in other child support cases under W.S. 20-2-303, 20-2-304, 20-2-307, 20-2-311, 20-2-401 through 20-2-406 and 20-6-101 through 20-6-222, or in any manner provided by law for enforcement of a civil judgment for money.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>14-6-237. Transfer hearing; transfer of proceedings commenced in district court or in municipal or circuit court.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) After a petition alleging a child has committed a delinquent act is filed, the court may, on its own motion or that of any party any time prior to the adjudicatory hearing, order a transfer hearing to determine if the matter should be transferred to another court having jurisdiction of the offense charged for criminal prosecution as provided by law. Notice in writing of the time, place and purpose of the transfer hearing shall be given to the child and his parents, guardian or custodian at least three (3) days before the hearing. The transfer hearing shall be conducted in conformity with W.S. 14-6-222 through 14-6-224 except there shall be no jury.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court shall order the matter transferred to the appropriate court for prosecution if after the transfer hearing it finds that proper reason therefor exists. The determinative factors to be considered by the judge in deciding whether the juvenile court's jurisdiction over such offenses will be waived are the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the protection of the community required waiver;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated or willful manner;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons especially if personal injury resulted;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense in one (1) court when the juvenile's associates in the alleged offense are adults who will be charged with a crime;</p>
                  <p>(v) The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined by consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude and pattern of living;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The record and previous history of the juvenile, including previous contacts with the law enforcement agencies, juvenile courts and other jurisdictions, prior periods of probation to this court, or prior commitments to juvenile institutions;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The prospects for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is found to have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services and facilities currently available to the juvenile court.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the court orders the matter transferred under subsection (b) of this section, the court shall state on the record its basis for the decision.</p>
                  <p>(d) The court may make any necessary orders for the detention of the child until the court to which the matter is transferred has acquired jurisdiction, at which time jurisdiction of the juvenile court with respect to the alleged delinquent act terminates.</p>
                  <p>(e) Statements made by the child at a transfer hearing are not admissible against him over objection in a criminal proceeding following the transfer.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the case is not transferred, the judge who conducted the hearing shall not, over objection of an interested party, preside at the adjudicatory hearing on the petition. If the case is transferred to a court of which the judge who conducted the transfer hearing is also a judge, he may be disqualified from presiding at the criminal proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(g) If any proceeding commenced in the district court is within the concurrent jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the district court may on motion of any party or on its own motion order any proceeding transferred to the juvenile court. The district court judge may, after notice and hearing, find the matter more properly suited to disposition under the provisions of this act. The order of transfer confers upon the juvenile court full jurisdiction in the matter as if originally commenced in the juvenile court.</p>
                  <p>(h) No court other than the district court shall order the transfer of a case to juvenile court. At any time after a proceeding over which the juvenile court has concurrent jurisdiction is commenced in municipal or circuit court, the judge of the court in which the proceeding is commenced may on the court's own motion, or on the motion of any party, suspend further proceedings and refer the case to the office of the district attorney to determine whether a petition should be filed in the juvenile court to commence a proceeding under this act. If a petition is filed under this act, the original proceeding commenced in the municipal or circuit court shall be dismissed. If the district attorney determines not to file a petition under this act, the district attorney shall immediately notify the municipal or circuit court and the proceeding commenced in that court may continue.</p>

                  <p>(ii) A petition has been filed in juvenile court alleging the child with having committed a delinquent act which would constitute a felony;</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person adjudicated delinquent as a result of having committed a delinquent act other than a violent felony as defined by W.S. 6-1-104(a)(xii), under the provisions of this act may petition the court for the expungement of his record in the juvenile court upon reaching the age of majority. Any petition filed under this section shall be verified by the petitioner, served upon and reviewed by the prosecuting attorney, and no order granting expungement shall be issued prior to the expiration of twenty (20) days after service was made. The prosecuting attorney shall file with the court, an objection, if any, to the petition within twenty (20) days after service. If an objection is filed, the court shall set the matter for hearing. If an objection is filed and after investigation the court finds that the petitioner has not been convicted of a felony since adjudication, that no proceeding involving a felony is pending or being instituted against the petitioner and the rehabilitation of the petitioner has been attained to the satisfaction of the court or the prosecuting attorney, it shall order expunged all records in any format including electronic records in the custody of the court or any agency or official, pertaining to the petitioner's case. If no objection is filed, the court may summarily enter an order if the court finds that the petitioner is otherwise eligible for relief under this subsection. Copies of the order shall be sent to each agency or official named in the order. The prosecuting attorney, to the extent practicable and if the state filed the petition for expungement as authorized by W.S. 7-13-1401, shall inform the juvenile of the order of expungement and of the practical effects of the expungement. Upon entry of an order the proceedings in the petitioner's case are deemed never to have occurred and the petitioner may reply accordingly upon any inquiry in the matter.</p>
                  <p>(b) The record of a minor convicted of a violation of a municipal ordinance may be expunged in the same manner as provided in subsection (a) of this section by petition to the municipal court.</p>
                  <p>(c) The record of a minor convicted of a misdemeanor in circuit court may be expunged in the same manner as provided in subsection (a) of this section by petition to the circuit court.</p>
                  <p>(d) The record of a minor admitted to a diversion program or granted a deferral pursuant to Wyoming statute may be expunged in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as provided in subsection (a) of this section by petition to the court ordering the diversion program or deferral.</p>
                  <p>(e) A record of arrest, charges or disposition of a minor resulting in dismissal, declined prosecution or otherwise not resulting in a conviction or an adjudication of delinquency or an adjudication of being a child in need of supervision may be expunged in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as provided in subsection (a) of this section by petition to the court.</p>
                  <p>(f) For purposes of this section, "expungement" means to permanently destroy or delete all records, including physical and electronic records, documents and images of documents. If a minor's name appears on a court list, index or other compilation containing other information not subject to expungement, "expungement" means to redact by obliterating the minor's name from the record.</p>
                  <p>(g) After an order of expungement issued under this section, no record of the minor's identification may be retained by any law enforcement agency, the juvenile court, or by any municipal court, circuit court or any state agency or department except as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) An agency may retain records to comply with federal reporting requirements. Records kept under this paragraph shall not be otherwise disclosed or released except for the federal reporting purposes and shall be expunged within ten (10) years of the completion of the initial court case;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Expungement of electronic records in a backup database may be completed upon restoration of the backup database, provided that the backup database is not accessible until restored. Any law enforcement agency, court or state agency subject to this paragraph shall implement policies and procedures to ensure expungement of records following restoration of a backup database.</p>
                  <p>(h) The state or municipality may petition the court for the expungement of a record in the juvenile court, circuit court or municipal court pursuant to subsections (a) through (c) of this section, upon the person who was adjudicated delinquent or convicted reaching the age of majority.</p>
                  <p>(j) No filing fee shall be required for a petition for the expungement of a juvenile record under this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) A parent or guardian having custody of a child shall exercise such parental control and authority over the child as is reasonably necessary to prevent the child from engaging in delinquent acts.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the court finds at the hearing of a juvenile petition that the parent or guardian having custody of the child has failed or neglected to subject the juvenile to reasonable parental control and authority, and that such failure or neglect is the proximate cause of the act or acts of the juvenile upon which a finding of delinquency is based, the court may, if the child is placed on probation, require the parent or guardian to furnish a cash deposit or bond in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), conditioned upon the faithful discharge of the conditions of the child's probation.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court may declare all or part of a cash deposit or bond posted under subsection (b) of this section forfeited if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The juvenile commits a subsequent delinquent act or is found to be in contempt of court or to have violated the terms of his probation; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The court, after hearing, finds that the child's act was proximately caused by the failure or neglect of the parent or guardian to subject the juvenile to reasonable parental control and authority, including, but not limited to, enforcement of curfew, home detention, school attendance, or other conditions of probation.</p>
                  <p>(d) Funds received upon forfeiture of a cash deposit or bond under subsection (c) of this section shall be applied in payment of damages, if any, which may have been caused by the juvenile. The balance of the proceeds shall be retained by the court to apply to any future damages resulting from the act or acts of the juvenile until the juvenile reaches eighteen (18) years of age at which time any remaining proceeds shall be returned to the parent or guardian.</p>
                  <p>(e) The provisions of this section as it relates to the failure or neglect of a parent or guardian to subject a child to reasonable parental control and authority, are in addition to and not in substitution for any other requirements of law.

                  <p>(a) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, when a child is adjudicated as a delinquent the juvenile court may, in a disposition hearing, assign the child one (1) of the following sanction levels according to the child's conduct:</p>
                  <p>(i) For a misdemeanor punishable under the Wyoming Criminal Code by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, the sanction level is one;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For a misdemeanor punishable under the Wyoming Criminal Code by imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, the sanction level is two;</p>
                  <p>(iii) For a felony, other than a violent felony as defined by W.S. 6-1-104(a)(xii), the sanction level is three;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For a violent felony as defined by W.S. 6-1-104(a)(xii), other than a felony punishable by life, life without parole or death, the sanction level is four;</p>

                  <p>(b) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if the child's subsequent adjudication of delinquent conduct involves a violation of the Wyoming Criminal Code that is the same level of seriousness as the child's previous conduct, the juvenile court may assign the child a sanction level that is one (1) level higher than the previously assigned sanction level, unless the child's previously assigned sanction level is five.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the court determines that a child assigned a sanction level of one through four has violated a condition imposed under that sanction level, the court shall conduct a new disposition hearing and may assign the child a sanction level that is one (1) level higher than the previously assigned sanction level.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the juvenile court deviates from the guidelines under this section it shall state in writing its reasons for the deviation and enter the statement into the record.

                  <p>(c) The child shall be given an opportunity to admit or deny the allegations in the petition. If the allegations are admitted, the court shall make the appropriate adjudication and may proceed immediately to a disposition of the case, provided the court has the predisposition report and multidisciplinary recommendations, in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 14-6-429, except that a commissioner acting in the absence or incapacity of the judge may take testimony to establish a factual basis and accept an admission and perform all other requirements of the initial hearing but shall not proceed to disposition. If denied, the court shall set a time not to exceed sixty (60) days for an adjudicatory hearing, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing.

                  <p>(i) Place the child in the custody and supervision of his parents, guardian or custodian, under the protective supervision of the department of family services or under the supervision of any individual or organization approved by the court that agrees to supervise the child;</p>

                  <p>(iii) Impose any other terms and conditions of release deemed reasonably necessary to assure the appearance of the child at subsequent proceedings or necessary to his protection from harm.</p>
                  <p>(e) All relevant and material evidence helpful in determining the need for detention or shelter care may be admitted by the court even though not competent in an adjudicatory hearing on the allegations of the petition.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a child is not released after a detention or shelter care hearing and it appears by sworn statement of the parents, guardian or custodian that they did not receive notice and did not waive notice and appearance at the hearing, the court shall rehear the matter without delay.</p>

                  <p>(a) In proceedings under this act, service of order to appear or other process within the state shall be made by the sheriff of the county where service is made, by his undersheriff or deputy or by any law enforcement officer or responsible adult not a party to the proceeding and appointed by the clerk.</p>
                  <p>(b) Within the state, service of order to appear is made by personally delivering a copy of the order together with a copy of the petition to the person ordered to appear, provided that parents of a child may both be served by personally delivering to either parent two (2) copies of the order and petition, one (1) copy for each parent. A child under the age of fourteen (14) years is served by delivering a copy of the order together with a copy of the petition to the child's parents, guardian, custodian or other adult having the actual physical custody and control of the child or to a guardian ad litem or attorney appointed for the child.</p>
                  <p>(c) If it appears to the court by affidavit that the parents, guardian or custodian of the child cannot be found within the state, the court may order personal service outside the state or service by certified mail with return receipt requested signed by addressee only.

                  <p>(d) Service by certified mail is complete on the date the clerk receives the return receipt signed by addressee. Personal service either within or outside the state is complete on the date when copies of the order to appear and petition are delivered to the person to be served.</p>
                  <p>(e) When personal service of order to appear is made within the state, service shall be completed not less than two (2) days before the hearing and when made outside the state, service shall be completed not less than five (5) days before the hearing. However, notwithstanding any provision within this act, the court may order that a child be taken into custody as provided in W.S. 14-6-413 or that a child be held in detention or shelter care pending further proceedings as provided in W.S. 14-6-409, even though service of order to appear on the parents, guardian or custodian of the child is not complete at the time of making the order.</p>

                  <p>(b) The affidavit shall be in writing, signed and affirmed by the affiant. The affidavit shall set forth:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and age of the child sought, provided that if the name or age of the child is unknown the affidavit shall set forth a description of the child sufficient to identify him with reasonable certainty and a statement that the affiant believes the child is of age to come within the provisions of this act; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The affiant's belief that the child sought is in need of supervision and is in hiding to avoid service of process or being taken into custody, and a statement of the facts upon which the belief is based.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any time after the filing of a petition, on motion of the district attorney or the child's parents, guardian, custodian or attorney or on motion of the court, the court may order the child to be examined by a licensed and qualified physician, surgeon, psychiatrist, psychologist or licensed mental health professional designated by the court to aid in determining the physical and mental condition of the child. The examination shall be conducted on an outpatient basis, but the court may commit the child to a suitable medical facility or institution for examination if deemed necessary. Commitment for examination shall not exceed fifteen (15) days. Any time after the filing of a petition, the court on its own motion or on motion of the district attorney or the child's parents, guardian, custodian or attorney, may order the child's parents, guardians or other custodial members of the child's family to undergo a substance abuse assessment at the expense of the child's parents, guardians or other custodial members of the child's family and to fully comply with all findings and recommendations set forth in the assessment. Failure to comply may result in contempt proceedings as set forth in W.S. 14-6-438.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a child has been committed to a medical facility or institution for mental examination prior to adjudication of the petition and if it appears to the court from the mental examination that the child is competent to participate in further proceedings and is not mentally ill or intellectually disabled to a degree rendering the child subject to involuntary commitment to a residential treatment facility, the court shall order the child returned to the court without delay.</p>
                  <p>(c) If it appears to the court by mental examination conducted before adjudication of the petition that a child alleged to be in need of supervision is incompetent to participate in further proceedings by reason of mental illness or intellectual disability to a degree rendering the child subject to involuntary commitment to a residential treatment facility, the court shall hold further proceedings under this act in abeyance. The district attorney shall then commence proceedings in the district court for commitment of the child to the appropriate institution as provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(d) The juvenile court shall retain jurisdiction of the child on the petition pending final determination of the commitment proceedings in the district court. If proceedings in the district court commit the child to a facility or institution for treatment and care of people with mental illness or intellectual disability, the petition shall be dismissed and further proceedings under this act terminate. If proceedings in the district court determine the child does not have a mental illness or an intellectual disability to a degree rendering him subject to involuntary commitment, the court shall proceed to a final adjudication of the petition and disposition of the child under the provisions of this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) At their first appearance before the court the child and his parents, guardian or custodian shall be advised by the court of the child's right to be represented by counsel at every stage of the proceedings including appeal, and to employ counsel of their own choice.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court shall upon request appoint counsel to represent the child if the child, his parents, guardian or custodian are unable to obtain counsel. If appointment of counsel is requested, the court shall require the child and his parents, guardian or custodian to verify their financial condition under oath, either by written affidavit signed and sworn to by the parties or by sworn testimony made a part of the record of the proceedings. The affidavit or sworn testimony shall state they are without sufficient money, property, assets or credit to employ counsel. The court may require further verification of financial condition if it deems necessary. If the child requests counsel and his parents, guardian, custodian or other person responsible for the child's support is able but unwilling to obtain counsel for the child, the court shall appoint counsel to represent the child and may direct reimbursement of counsel fees under W.S. 14-6-434.</p>

                  <p>(a) At their initial hearing, which may be held after a detention or shelter care hearing, the child and his parents, guardian or custodian shall be advised by the court of their rights under law and as provided in this act. They shall also be advised of the specific allegations in the petition and the child shall be given an opportunity to admit or deny them. They shall also be advised of the possible liability for costs of treatment or services pursuant to this act. It is not necessary at the initial appearance for the district attorney to establish probable cause to believe the allegations in the petition are true. When a detention or shelter care hearing is held in accordance with W.S. 14-6-409, a separate initial hearing is not required if the child and his parents, guardian or custodian were present at the detention or shelter care hearing and advised by the court as provided in this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the allegations of the petition are denied, the court may, with consent of the parties, proceed immediately to hear evidence on the petition or it may set a later time not to exceed sixty (60) days for an adjudicatory hearing, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing. In no case shall the court hold the adjudicatory hearing more than ninety (90) days after the date the petition is filed. Only competent, relevant and material evidence shall be admissible at an adjudicatory hearing to determine the truth of the allegations in the petition. If after an adjudicatory hearing the court finds that the allegations in the petition are not established as required by this act, it shall dismiss the petition and order the child released from any detention or shelter care.</p>
                  <p>(c) If after an adjudicatory hearing or a valid admission or confession the court or jury finds that a child is in need of supervision, it shall enter a decree to that effect stating the jurisdictional facts upon which the decree is based. It may then proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing within sixty (60) days to make proper disposition of the child, unless the court finds good cause to delay or postpone the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(d) In detention or shelter care hearings or disposition hearings, all material and relevant evidence helpful in determining questions may be received by the court and relied upon for probative value. The parties or their counsel may examine and controvert written reports received as evidence and cross-examine persons making the reports.</p>
                  <p>(e) On motion of any party or on its own motion, the court may continue a disposition hearing for a reasonable time not to exceed sixty (60) days to receive reports and other evidence bearing on the disposition to be made. The court shall make an appropriate order for detention or shelter care of the child or for his release from detention or shelter care subject to any terms and conditions the court deems necessary during the period of continuance.</p>
                  <p>(f) At any time prior to disposition under W.S. 14-6-429, the court, on motion of any party or on its own motion, may reconsider its order regarding detention or shelter care or conditions of release made under W.S. 14-6-409 or 14-6-414.</p>

The multidisciplinary team shall, as quickly as reasonably possible, review the child's personal and family history, school, mental health and department of family services records and any other pertinent information, for the purpose of making case planning recommendations.

                  <p>(j) Any member of a multidisciplinary team who cannot attend team meetings in person or by telephone may submit written reports and recommendations to the other team members and to the court. Individuals who are not members of the multidisciplinary team but have knowledge pertinent to the team's decisions may be asked to provide information to the multidisciplinary team. The individuals shall be bound by the confidentiality provisions of subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) The department shall develop a case plan for a juvenile when there is a recommendation to place the child outside the home.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>14-6-428. Abeyance of proceedings by consent decree; term of decree; reinstatement of proceedings; effect of discharge or completing term.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) At any time after the filing of a petition alleging a child to be in need of supervision and before adjudication, the court may issue a consent decree ordering further proceedings held in abeyance and place a child in need of supervision under the supervision of the department of family services or any other qualified person the court may designate. The placement of the child is subject to the terms, conditions and stipulations agreed to by the parties affected. The consent decree shall not be entered without the consent of the district attorney, the child's legal representative, where applicable, and the child and the notification of the parents. Modifications to an existing consent decree may be allowed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The consent decree agreement shall be in writing and copies given to each of the parties. It shall include the case plan for the child or his family.</p>
                  <p>(c) A consent decree shall be in force for the period agreed upon by the parties but not longer than one (1) year unless sooner terminated by the court. If prior to discharge by the court or expiration of the consent decree, a child alleged to be in need of supervision fails to fulfill the terms and conditions of the decree or a new petition is filed alleging the child to be in need of supervision because of misconduct occurring during the term of the consent decree, the original petition and proceedings may be reinstated upon order of the court after hearing and the matter may proceed as though the consent decree had never been entered. If, as part of the consent decree, the child made an admission to any of the allegations contained in the original petition, that admission shall be entered only if the court orders that the original petition and proceeding be reinstated and the admissions, if any, be entered. If the admission is entered, the court may proceed to disposition pursuant to W.S. 14-6-426.</p>
                  <p>(d) If a consent decree is in effect and the child is in placement, the court shall hold a six (6) month review and twelve (12) month review as provided under W.S. 14-6-429.</p>
                  <p>(e) A child discharged by the court under a consent decree without reinstatement of the original petition and proceeding shall not thereafter be proceeded against in any court for the same misconduct alleged in the original petition.</p>

                  <p>(a) In determining the disposition to be made under this act in regard to any child:</p>
                  <p>(i) The court shall review the predisposition report, the recommendations, if any, of the multidisciplinary team, the case plan and other reports or evaluations ordered by the court and indicate on the record what materials were considered in reaching the disposition;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the court does not place the child in accordance with the recommendations of the predisposition report or multidisciplinary team, the court shall enter on the record specific findings of fact relied upon to support its decision to deviate from the recommended disposition;</p>
                  <p>(iii) When a child is adjudged by the court to be in need of supervision the court shall enter its decree to that effect and make a disposition as provided in this section that places the child in the least restrictive environment consistent with what is best suited to the public interest of preserving families, the physical, mental and moral welfare of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iv) When a child is adjudged to be in need of supervision the court shall ensure that reasonable efforts were made by the department of family services to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home or to make it possible for the child to return to the child's home. Before placing a child outside of the home, the court shall find by clear and convincing evidence that to return the child to the child's home would not be in the best interest of the child despite efforts that have been made;</p>
                  <p>(v) The court shall not order an out-of-state placement unless:</p>
                  <p>(A) Evidence has been presented to the court regarding the costs of the out-of-state placement being ordered together with evidence of the comparative costs of any suitable alternative in-state treatment program or facility, as determined by the department of family services pursuant to W.S. 21-13-315(d)(vii), whether or not placement in the in-state program or facility is currently available;</p>
                  <p>(B) The court makes an affirmative finding on the record that no placement can be made in a Wyoming institution or in a private residential treatment facility or group home located in Wyoming that can provide adequate treatment or services for the child; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The court states on the record why no in-state placement is available.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the child is found to be in need of supervision the court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Permit the child to remain in the custody of his parents, guardian or custodian under protective supervision, subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the court;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Transfer temporary legal custody to a relative or other suitable adult the court finds qualified to receive and care for the child, with supervision, subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the court;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Transfer temporary legal custody to a state or local public agency responsible for the care and placement of children in need of supervision, provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) The child shall not be committed to the Wyoming boys' school or the Wyoming girls' school unless the child has attained the age of twelve (12) years and is also found delinquent;</p>
                  <p>(B) The court may not transfer the temporary legal custody to a state agency for out-of-community placement unless the child or the child's family has failed to perform under a court supervised consent decree or the department of family services has certified that a community treatment plan has proven unsuccessful.</p>
                  <p>(c) In cases where a child is ordered removed from the child's home:</p>
                  <p>(i) If a child is committed or transferred to an agency or institution under this section:</p>
                  <p>(A) At least every three (3) months the agency or institution shall recommend to the court if the order should be continued;</p>
                  <p>(B) Not less than once every six (6) months, the court of jurisdiction shall conduct a formal review to assess and determine the appropriateness of the current placement, the reasonable efforts made to reunify the family, the safety of the child and the permanency plan for the child. During this review:</p>
                  <p>(I) The department of family services shall present to the court:</p>
                  <p>(1) If the permanency plan is classified as another planned permanent living arrangement, documentation of the ongoing and unsuccessful efforts to return the child home or place the child for adoption or with a legal guardian or a fit and willing relative for purposes of guardianship or adoption, including evidence of efforts to use social media or other search technology to find biological family members for the child;</p>

                  <p>b. The specific treatment needs that will be met for the child in the placement;</p>

                  <p>(e) An institution, organization or agency vested with legal custody of a child by court order shall with court approval, have the right to determine where and with whom the child shall live, provided that placement of the child does not remove him from the state of Wyoming without court authorization.

                  <p>(a) When legal custody of a child, other than temporary guardianship, is vested by court order in an individual, agency, institution or organization other than the child's parents, the court shall in the same or any subsequent proceeding inquire into the financial condition of the child's parents or any other person who may be legally obligated to support the child. After due notice and hearing the court shall order the parents or any other legally obligated person to pay a reasonable sum for the support and treatment of the child during the time that a dispositional order is in force. The requirements of W.S. 20-2-101 through 20-2-406 apply to this section. The amount of support shall be determined in accordance with the presumptive child support established by W.S. 20-2-304. In any case where the court has deviated from the presumptive child support, the reasons therefor shall be specifically set forth in the order. The amount ordered to be paid shall be paid to the clerk of the juvenile court for transmission to the person, institution or agency having legal custody of the child or to whom compensation is due. The clerk of court is authorized to receive periodic payments payable in the name or for the benefit of the child, including but not limited to social security, veteran's administration benefits or insurance annuities, and apply the payments as the court directs. An order for support under this subsection shall include a statement of the addresses and social security numbers if known, of each obligor, the names and addresses of each obligor's employer and the names and birth dates of each child to whom the order relates. The court shall order each obligor to notify the clerk of court in writing within fifteen (15) days of any change in address or employment. If any person who is legally obligated to support the child does not have full time employment, the court may require that person to seek full time employment and may require community service work in lieu of payment until full time employment is obtained.</p>
                  <p>(b) An order for the payment of money entered against a parent or other person legally obligated to support a child under the provisions of W.S. 14-6-434, 20-2-101 through 20-2-406 or this section shall be entered separately from the decree of disposition under W.S. 14-6-429 and shall not be treated as a part of the confidential court record under W.S. 14-6-437. The order may be filed in the district court of any county in the state. From the time of filing, the order shall have the same effect as a judgment or decree of the district court in a civil action and may be enforced by the district attorney, or the department of family services in the same manner and with the same powers as in other child support cases under W.S. 20-2-303, 20-2-304, 20-2-307, 20-2-311, 20-2-401 through 20-2-406 and 20-6-101 through 20-6-222, or in any manner provided by law for enforcement of a civil judgment for money.</p>

                  <p>(a) The office of guardian ad litem shall enter into agreements with each county participating in the program. Agreements shall require counties to comply with all program rules and policies. The agreement shall establish the compensation rate within the county for attorneys providing legal representation as guardians ad litem in program cases and the reimbursement requirements. A county may agree with an attorney providing services under the program to pay a rate in excess of the rate set for payment by the program. If a county agrees to do so, it shall enter into a separate contract with the attorney providing services and shall be responsible and obligated to reimburse the program for one hundred percent (100%) of the excess amount. The county shall enter into a separate agreement with the office setting out the agreement, the excess rate and the responsibilities and obligations of all parties.</p>
                  <p>(b) The program shall pay from the guardian ad litem account one hundred percent (100%) of the fees for the legal representation of children by attorneys as guardians ad litem in program cases. Participating counties shall reimburse the program an amount equal to not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the agreed program fees, not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the program's administrative cost prorated by program funds expended in each county and one hundred percent (100%) of excess rate fees. The program shall invoice the county for its proportionate share. In the event a county does not make payments within ninety (90) days, the state treasurer may deduct the amount from sales tax revenues due to the county from the state and shall credit the amount to the program account.</p>
                  <p>(c) There is created a guardian ad litem account. All reimbursements received under the program shall be deposited to the account. Funds within the account are continuously appropriated to the office of guardian ad litem for expenditure for the sole purpose of the guardian ad litem program.</p>
                  <p>(d) Agreements entered into under this section shall include provision for each county, in which guardians ad litem employed by or under contract with the program are located, to provide adequate space and utility services, other than telephone service, for the use of the program’s guardians ad litem. If suitable office space for all guardians ad litem cannot be provided, the county shall provide, based upon a proportional share, a monthly stipend to all program guardians ad litem housed in private facilities. The proportional share shall be determined by the program, based upon the counties served by each guardian ad litem not provided suitable office space. The stipend shall be paid directly by the county to the program guardian ad litem.</p>
                  <p>(e) A county which does not participate in the program, shall be responsible for the full cost of guardians ad litem legal fees as provided by W.S. 14-2-318(b)(i), 14-3-434(b)(vi), 14-6-235(b)(vi) and 14-6-434(b)(vi).</p>
                  <p>(f) The office shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the department of family services under which a guardian ad litem will be provided for cases in which the department is required by law or court order to provide guardian ad litem services in any of the cases or actions specified in W.S. 14-12-101(a). The department shall reimburse the program an amount equal to not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the agreed program fees paid to guardians ad litem in actions under this subsection.</p>
