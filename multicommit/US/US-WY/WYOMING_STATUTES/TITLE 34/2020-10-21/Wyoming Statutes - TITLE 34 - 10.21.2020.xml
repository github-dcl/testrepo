                  <p>(d) As used in this section "mortgagee" means the mortgagee named in the original mortgage or, if assigned, the current holder of the mortgage or the servicing agent for the current holder of the mortgage.</p>

                  <p>(a) The creation of fees tail is not permitted. The use in an otherwise effective conveyance of property of language appropriate to create a fee tail, creates a fee simple in the person who would have taken a fee tail. Any future interest limited upon such an interest is a limitation upon the fee simple and its validity is determined accordingly.</p>
                  <p>(b) The doctrine of worthier title is abolished as a rule of law and as a rule of construction. Language in a will, trust agreement, beneficiary designation or other governing instrument describing the beneficiaries of a disposition as "heirs," "heirs at law," "next of kin," "distributees," "relatives" or "family" or language of similar import, does not create or presumptively create a reversionary interest in the transferor.</p>

                  <p>(a) No interest in real property shall be valid unless it must vest not later than twenty-one (21) years after some life in being at the creation of the interest and any period of gestation involved in the situation to which the limitation applies.

                  <p>(viii) Repealed By Laws 2012, Ch. 45, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(b) A buyer may waive disclosure of the information required under subsections (a) and (e) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) No transfer subject to this section shall be invalidated solely because of the failure to comply with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. However, any person who willfully or negligently violates or fails to perform the duties prescribed by subsection (a) of this section shall be liable in the amount of actual damages suffered by the buyer.</p>
                  <p>(d) For purposes of this section, "vacant land" means land:</p>
                  <p>(i) With no habitable dwelling;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Not within the boundaries of a platted subdivision, or city or town; and</p>

                  <p>(a) The ownership of all pore space in all strata below the surface lands and waters of this state is declared to be vested in the several owners of the surface above the strata.</p>
                  <p>(b) A conveyance of the surface ownership of real property shall be a conveyance of the pore space in all strata below the surface of such real property unless the ownership interest in such pore space previously has been severed from the surface ownership or is explicitly excluded in the conveyance. The ownership of pore space in strata may be conveyed in the manner provided by law for the transfer of mineral interests in real property. No agreement conveying mineral or other interests underlying the surface shall act to convey ownership of any pore space in the stratum unless the agreement explicitly conveys that ownership interest.</p>
                  <p>(c) No provision of law, including a lawfully adopted rule or regulation, requiring notice to be given to a surface owner, to an owner of the mineral interest, or to both, shall be construed to require notice to persons holding ownership interest in any pore space in the underlying strata unless the law specifies notice to such persons is required.</p>
                  <p>(d) As used in this section, the term "pore space" is defined to mean subsurface space which can be used as storage space for carbon dioxide or other substances.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to change or alter the common law as of July 1, 2008, as it relates to the rights belonging to, or the dominance of, the mineral estate. For the purpose of determining the priority of subsurface uses between a severed mineral estate and pore space as defined in subsection (d) of this section, the severed mineral estate is dominant regardless of whether ownership of the pore space is vested in the several owners of the surface or is owned separately from the surface.</p>
                  <p>(f) All instruments which transfer the rights to pore space under this section shall describe the scope of any right to use the surface estate. The owner of any pore space right shall have no right to use the surface estate beyond that set out in a properly recorded instrument.</p>
                  <p>(g) Transfers of pore space rights made after July 1, 2008 are null and void at the option of the owner of the surface estate if the transfer instrument does not contain a specific description of the location of the pore space being transferred. The description may include but is not limited to a subsurface geologic or seismic survey or a metes and bounds description of the surface lying over the transferred pore space. In the event a description of the surface is used, the transfer shall be deemed to include pore space at all depths underlying the described surface area unless specifically excluded. The validity of pore space rights under this subsection shall not affect the respective liabilities of any party and such liabilities shall operate in the same manner as if the pore space transfer were valid.</p>
                  <p>(h) Nothing in this section shall alter, amend, diminish or invalidate rights to the use of subsurface pore space that were acquired by contract or lease prior to July 1, 2008.</p>

For purposes of this section, it shall be sufficient to define a trust by providing in the text of the instrument the name of the trustee or trustees and the name of the trust, the date of the trust or other agreement, or by referring by proper description of the affecting record book, page, document number or file, to the instrument, order, decree or other writing, which is of public record in the county in which the land so conveyed is located and in which the required information appears; otherwise the description of a grantee in any representative capacity in each instrument of conveyance shall be considered and held to be a description of the grantee, only, and shall not be notice of any trust, agency or other representative capacity of the grantee who shall be held as vested with the power to convey, transfer, encumber or release the affected title. Whenever the grantee shall execute and deliver a conveyance, transfer, encumbrance or release of the property in a representative capacity, it shall not thereafter be questioned by anyone claiming as a beneficiary under the trust or agency or by anyone claiming by, through or under any undisclosed beneficiary. Trust property in the name of the trustee, agent or representative and owned only in that capacity shall not be subject to execution for the grantee's individual obligations.</p>

Proof of possession by the grantee and the record of the tax deed constitutes conclusive evidence of the legality and effectiveness of the deed and any proceedings upon which the deed is based, and of the title of the grantee. As a means of proving possession and preserving evidence of possession under a tax deed, the then owner or holder of the title conveyed or purportedly conveyed by the tax deed may, at any time after two (2) years from the date of recording of the tax deed, file for record in the office of the county clerk in which the real estate is located an affidavit substantially in the following form:</p>

                <p>(a) As used in this act:</p>
                <p>(i) "Marketable record title" means a title of record, as indicated in W.S. 34-10-103 which operates to extinguish such interests and claims, existing prior to the effective date of the root of title, as are stated in W.S. 34-10-105;</p>
                <p>(ii) "Records" includes probate and other official public records, as well as records in the office of the county clerk;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Recording", when applied to the official records of a probate or other court, includes filing;</p>
                <p>(iv) "Person dealing with land" includes a purchaser of any estate or interest therein, a mortgagee, a levying or attaching creditor, a land contract vendee, or any other person seeking to acquire an estate or interest therein, or impose a lien thereon;</p>
                <p>(v) "Root of title" means that conveyance or other title transaction in the chain of title of a person, purporting to create the interest claimed by the person, upon which he relies as a basis for the marketability of his title, and which was the most recent to be recorded as of a date forty (40) years prior to the time when marketability is being determined. The effective date of the "root of title" is the date on which it is recorded;</p>
                <p>(vi) "Title transaction" means any transaction affecting title to any interest in land, including title by will or descent, title by tax deed, or by trustee's, referee's, guardian's, executor's, administrator's, master in chancery's, or sheriff's deed, or decree of any court, as well as warranty deed, quitclaim deed, deed of trust or mortgage;</p>
                <p>(vii) "This act" means W.S. 34-10-101 through 34-10-109.</p>

                <p>Any person having the legal capacity to own land in this state, who has an unbroken chain of title of record to any interest in land for forty (40) years or more, shall be deemed to have a marketable record title to such interest subject only to the matters stated in W.S. 34-10-104. A person shall be deemed to have such an unbroken chain of title when the official public records disclose a conveyance or other title transaction of record not less than forty (40) years at the time the marketability is to be determined, which conveyance or other title transaction purports to create the interest, either in the person claiming the interest, or some other person from whom, by one (1) or more conveyances or other title transactions of record, the purported interest has become vested in the person claiming the interest, so long as nothing appears of record, in either case, purporting to divest the claimant of his purported interest.</p>

                <p>(a) Marketable record title is subject to:</p>
                <p>(i) All interests and defects which are inherent in the chain of record title. However, a general reference in the chain, to easements, use restrictions or other interests created prior to the root of title is not sufficient to preserve them, unless specific identification is made therein of a recorded title transaction which creates the easement, use restriction or other interest;</p>
                <p>(ii) All interests preserved by the filing of proper notice or by possession by the same owner continuously for a period of forty (40) years or more, in accordance with W.S. 34-10-106;</p>
                <p>(iii) The rights of any person arising from prescriptive use or period of adverse possession or user which was in whole or in part subsequent to the effective date of the root of title;</p>
                <p>(iv) Any interest arising out of a title transaction which has been recorded subsequent to the effective date of the root of title from which the unbroken chain of title of record is started. However, the recording does not revive or give validity to any interest which has been extinguished prior to the time of the recording by the operation of W.S. 34-10-105;</p>
                <p>(v) The exceptions stated in W.S. 34-10-108(a) as to rights of reversioners in leases, as to apparent easements and interests in the nature of easements, as to water rights, as to mineral interests and as to interests of the state of Wyoming and of the United States.</p>

All such interests, claims or charges, however denominated, whether legal or equitable, present or future, whether asserted by a person sui juris or under a disability, whether such person is within or without the state, whether such person is natural, corporate, private or governmental, are null and void.</p>

                <p>(a) Any person claiming an interest in land may preserve and keep effective his interest by filing for record during the forty (40) year period immediately following the effective date of the root of title of the person whose record title would otherwise be marketable, a notice in writing, duly verified by oath, setting forth the nature of the claim. No disability or lack of knowledge of any kind on the part of anyone shall suspend the running of the forty (40) year period. Notice may be filed for record by the claimant or by any other person acting on behalf of any claimant who is:</p>
                <p>(i) Under a disability;</p>
                <p>(ii) Unable to assert a claim on his own behalf; or</p>
                <p>(iii) One (1) of a class, but whose identity cannot be established or is uncertain at the time of filing the notice of claim for record.</p>
                <p>(b) If the same record owner of any possessory interest in land has been in possession of the land continuously for a period of forty (40) years or more, during which period no title transaction with respect to the interest appears of record in his chain of title, and no notice has been filed by him or on his behalf as provided in subsection (a) of this section, and his possession continues to the time when marketability is being determined, the period of possession is equivalent to the filing of the notice immediately preceding the termination of the forty (40) year period described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

However, if the claim is founded upon a recorded instrument, then the description in the notice may be the same as that contained in the recorded instrument. Notice shall be filed for record in the office of the county clerk of the county or counties where the land described is situated. The recorder of each county shall accept all such notices presented to him which describe land located in the county in which he serves and shall enter and record full copies thereof in the same way that deeds and other instruments are recorded. Each recorder shall charge the same fees for the recording thereof as are charged for recording deeds. In indexing the notices in his office each recorder shall enter the notices under the grantee indexes of deeds under the names of the claimants appearing in the notices.</p>

                <p>(b) The affidavits may relate to the following matters: age, sex, birth, death, relationship, family history, names, identity of parties, marital status, homestead status, possession, occupancy possession, residence, service in the armed forces, conflicts and ambiguities in descriptions of land in recorded instruments, and the happening of any condition or event which may terminate an estate or interest.</p>
                <p>(c) The affidavits shall include a description of the land, title to which may be affected by facts stated in the affidavit, and shall state the name of the person appearing by the record to be the owner of the land at the time of the recording of the affidavit. For affidavits involving subsequently discovered real property under W.S. 2-9-203, the affidavit shall also include a copy of the judicial determination of the decedent's heirs or right of descent. The county clerk shall index the affidavit in the name of the record owner and in the same manner as deeds are recorded.</p>

                <p>(a) Every plat shall contain a statement to the effect that "the above or foregoing subdivision of (here insert a correct description of the land or parcel subdivided) as appears on this plat, is with the free consent, and in accordance with the desires of the undersigned owners and proprietors", which shall be signed by the owners and proprietors, and shall be duly acknowledged before some officer authorized to take the acknowledgement of deeds. The plat shall meet the approval of the board of county commissioners if it is of land situated without the boundaries of any city or town or by the governing body of the city or town if situated within the boundaries of such city or town. Provided, however, that any plat of land which is adjacent to any incorporated city or town or within one (1) mile of the boundaries of any city or town and which is not subject to regulation under and pursuant to a comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to W.S. 18-5-202(b), shall be jointly approved by both the board of county commissioners of the county and the governing body of the city or town before the plat shall be filed and recorded in the office of the county clerk.</p>
                <p>(b) If a city or town approval is not required under this section and the plat is located within one (1) mile of the boundaries of a first class city or town, or within one-half (1/2) mile of a town with a population of less than four thousand (4,000), the board of county commissioners, upon receipt of a plat application, shall solicit comments from the governing body of the city or town relating to impacts to the city or town's infrastructure or other development plans resulting from the proposed plat and development. The board shall consider the city or town's comments that are received by the board at least twenty (20) business days prior to the scheduled final consideration of the plat proposal and shall respond in writing to the city or town about any items of disagreement. To the extent practical, the board of county commissioners shall ensure that a plat application meets the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Is consistent with any applicable city and county land use or comprehensive plan;</p>
                <p>(ii) Conforms to any adopted street plan of the city, town or county;</p>
                <p>(iii) Contains all areas for streets, roads and alleys that are dedicated rights-of-way;</p>
                <p>(iv) Contains dedicated easements for all existing and proposed utilities; and</p>
                <p>(v) Contains any additional criteria the governing body of the city or town and the board of county commissioners agree to through a jointly adopted plan or voluntary agreement.</p>
                <p>(c) When executed, acknowledged and approved as provided in this section, the plat shall be filed and recorded in the office of the clerk of the proper county.</p>

                <p>(a) The validity of a transfer made in a manner prescribed in this act is not affected by:</p>
                <p>(i) Failure of the transferor to comply with W.S. 34-13-122(c) concerning possession and control;</p>
                <p>(ii) Designation of an ineligible custodian, except designation of the transferor in the case of property for which the transferor is ineligible to serve as custodian under W.S. 34-13-122(a); or</p>
                <p>(iii) Death or incapacity of the person nominated under W.S. 34-13-116 or designated under W.S. 34-13-122 as custodian or the disclaimer of the office by that person.</p>
                <p>(b) A transfer made pursuant to W.S. 34-13-122 is irrevocable, and the custodial property is indefeasibly vested in the minor, but the custodian has all the rights, powers, duties and authority provided in this act, and neither the minor nor the minor's legal representative has any right, power, duty or authority with respect to the custodial property except as provided in this act.</p>
                <p>(c) By making a transfer pursuant to this act, the transferor incorporates in the disposition all the provisions of this act and grants to the custodian, and to any third person dealing with a person designated as custodian, the respective powers, rights and immunities provided in this act.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34-13-125. Care of custodial property.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A custodian shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Take control of custodial property;</p>
                <p>(ii) Register or record title to custodial property if appropriate; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Collect, hold, manage, invest and reinvest custodial property.</p>
                <p>(b) In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries. If a custodian has special skills or is named custodian on the basis of representations of special skills or expertise, the custodian is under a duty to use those skills. However, a custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor's estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.</p>
                <p>(c) A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on:</p>
                <p>(i) The life of the minor only if the minor or the minor's estate is the sole beneficiary; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the extent that the minor, the minor's estate or the custodian in the capacity of custodian is the irrevocable beneficiary.</p>
                <p>(d) A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the minor's interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration is so identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words: "as a custodian for .... (name of minor) under the Wyoming Uniform Transfers to Minors Act".</p>
                <p>(e) A custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial property, including information necessary for the preparation of the minor's tax returns and shall make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent or legal representative of the minor or by the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) years.</p>

                <p>(a) A person nominated under W.S. 34-13-116 or designated under W.S. 34-13-122 as custodian may decline to serve by delivering a valid disclaimer to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor or the transferor's legal representative. If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute future custodian able, willing and eligible to serve was nominated, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute future custodian; otherwise the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under W.S. 34-13-122(a). The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian.</p>
                <p>(b) A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under W.S. 34-13-117 as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor. If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or is removed.</p>
                <p>(c) A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) years and to the successor custodian and by transferring the custodial property to the successor custodian.</p>
                <p>(d) If a custodian is ineligible, dies or becomes incapacitated without having effectively designated a successor and the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) years, the minor may designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in subsection (b) of this section, an adult member of the minor's family, a conservator of the minor or a trust company. If the minor has not attained the age of fourteen (14) years or fails to act within sixty (60) days after the ineligibility, death or incapacity, the conservator of the minor becomes successor custodian. If the minor has no conservator or the conservator declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor's family or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.</p>
                <p>(e) A custodian who disclaims under subsection (a) of this section or resigns under subsection (c) of this section, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian. The successor custodian may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.</p>
                <p>(f) A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor's family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the conservator of the minor or the minor if the minor has attained the age of fourteen (14) years may petition the court to remove the custodian for cause and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under W.S. 34-13-117 or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.</p>

                <p>(b) To specify a changed time for transfer to the minor of the custodial property, the words "as custodian for (name of minor) until age ....

                <p><shortTitle>34-13-139. Extension of custodial term by custodian.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A custodian may extend the custodial term under this section to an age older than the age that is specified by this act or a transferring instrument made under W.S. 34-13-122, subject to the right of the minor to compel immediate distribution under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                <p>(b) To extend the custodial term under subsection (a) of this section, the custodian shall give the minor written notice of the custodian's intent to extend the custodial term. The notice must specify the duration of the extension by indicating the new custodial term and must inform the minor of the minor's right to compel immediate distribution under subsection (c) of this section. The custodian shall give the notice during the later of the following periods:</p>
                <p>(i) The six (6) month period that precedes the last day of the custodial term; or</p>
                <p>(ii) The six (6) month period that begins when the minor attains twenty-one (21) years of age.</p>
                <p>(c) Rather than permit the extension of the custodial term, the minor may compel immediate distribution of all or part of the custodial property by giving written notice to the custodian:</p>
                <p>(i) During the six (6) month period that begins on the last day of the current custodial term; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Within ninety (90) days after receiving the custodian's notice under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p>(d) If a minor does not exercise the minor's right to compel distribution under subsection (c) of this section, the custodial term shall be extended as indicated in the custodian's notice given under subsection (b) of this section, and the minor may not compel the immediate distribution of custodial property before the end of the custodial term, as extended.</p>
                <p>(e) A custodian may extend the custodial term more than once under this section.</p>
                <p>(f) As used in this section, "custodial term" means the time provided in or allowed by this act during which the custodian is directed to hold custodial property until the property is transferred to the minor.</p>

                  <p>(i) With actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debtor:</p>
                  <p>(A) Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur, debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.</p>

                  <p>(ii) The debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit;</p>
                  <p>(v) The transfer was of substantially all the debtor's assets;</p>

                  <p>(x) The transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and</p>

                  <p>(A) With respect to an asset that is real property other than a fixture, but including the interest of a seller or purchaser under a contract for the sale of the asset, when the transfer is so far perfected that a good-faith purchaser of the asset from the debtor against whom applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest in the asset that is superior to the interest of the transferee; and</p>
                  <p>(B) With respect to an asset that is not real property or that is a fixture, when the transfer is so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire a judicial lien otherwise than under this act that is superior to the interest of the transferee.</p>
                  <p>(b) If applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected as provided in subsection (a) of this section and the transfer is not so perfected before the commencement of an action for relief under this act, the transfer is deemed made immediately before the commencement of the action.</p>
                  <p>(c) If applicable law does not permit the transfer to be perfected as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the transfer is made when it becomes effective between the debtor and the transferee.</p>

                  <p>(a) A transfer or obligation is not voidable under W.S. 34-14-205(a)(i) against a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any subsequent transferee or obligee.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to the extent a transfer is voidable in an action by a creditor under W.S. 34-14-208(a)(i), the creditor may recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred, as adjusted under subsection (c) of this section, or the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim, whichever is less. The judgment may be entered against:</p>
                  <p>(i) The first transferee of the asset or the person for whose benefit the transfer was made; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any subsequent transferee other than a good- faith transferee or obligee who took for value or from any subsequent transferee or obligee.</p>

                  <p>(e) A transfer is not voidable under W.S. 34-14-205(a)(ii) or 34-14-206 if the transfer results from:</p>
                  <p>(i) Termination of a lease upon default by the debtor when the termination is pursuant to the lease and applicable law; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Enforcement of a security interest in compliance with article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
                  <p>(f) A transfer is not voidable under W.S. 34-14-206(b):</p>
                  <p>(i) To the extent the insider gave a new value to or for the benefit of the debtor after the transfer was made unless the new value was secured by a valid lien;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the insider; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) If made pursuant to a good-faith effort to rehabilitate the debtor and the transfer secured present value given for that purpose as well as an antecedent debt of the debtor.</p>

                <p>(i) An "individual air space unit" shall consist of any enclosed room or rooms occupying all or part of a floor or floors in a building of one (1) or more floors to be used for residential, professional, commercial or industrial purposes and which has access to a public street;</p>
                <p>(ii) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration or by written consent of all the condominium owners:</p>
                <p>(A) "General common elements" means the land on which a building or buildings are located; the foundations, columns, girders, beams, supports, main walls, roofs, halls, corridors, lobbies, stairs, stairways, fire escapes, entrances and exits of such building or buildings; the basements, yards, gardens, parking areas and storage spaces; the premises for the lodging of custodians or persons in charge of the property; installations of central services such as power, light, gas, hot and cold water, heating, refrigeration, central air conditioning and incinerating; the elevators, tanks, pumps, motors, fans, compressors, ducts and in general all apparatus and installations existing for common use; such community and commercial facilities as may be provided for in the declaration; and all other parts of the property necessary or convenient to its existence, maintenance and safety, or normally in common use;</p>

                <p>(a) Whenever condominium ownership of real property is created, or separate assessment of condominium units is desired, a written notice thereof shall be delivered to the assessor of the county in which said real property is situated, which notice shall set forth descriptions of the condominium units.</p>
                <p>Thereafter all taxes, assessments and other charges of this state or of any political subdivision or of any special improvement district or any other taxing or assessing authority shall be assessed against and collected on each condominium unit, each of which shall be carried on the tax books as a separate and distinct parcel for the purpose, and not on the building or property as a whole. The valuation of the general and limited common elements shall be assessed proportionately upon the individual air space unit in the manner provided in the declaration. The lien for taxes assessed to any individual condominium owner shall be confined to his condominium unit and to his undivided interest in the general and limited common elements. No forfeiture or sale of any condominium unit for delinquent taxes, mechanics, laborers or materialmen's liens, assessments or charges shall divest or in any way affect the title of other condominium units.</p>
                <p>(b) The declaration shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk where the condominium property is located. Such declaration shall provide for the filing for record of a map properly locating condominium units. Any instrument affecting the condominium unit may legally describe it by the identifying condominium unit number or symbol as shown on such map. If such declaration provides for the disposition of condominium units in the event of the destruction or obsolescence of buildings in which such units are situated and restricts partition of the common elements, the rules or laws known as the rule against perpetuities and the rule prohibiting unlawful restraints on alienation shall not be applied to defeat or limit any such provisions.</p>
                <p>(c) To the extent that any such declaration shall contain a mandatory requirement that all condominium unit owners shall be members of an association or corporation, or provide for the payment of charges assessed by the association upon condominium units, or the appointment of an attorney-in-fact to deal with the property upon its destruction or obsolescence, any rule of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the same shall be considered as covenants running with the land binding upon all condominium owners and their successors in interest. Any common law rule terminating agency upon death or disability of a principal shall not be applied to defeat or limit any such provisions.</p>

                  <p>(a) The secretary of state shall establish and operate a central filing system for effective financing statements. The system shall provide a means for filing effective financing statements or notices of such financing statements on a statewide basis. The system shall include requirements that:</p>
                  <p>(i) An effective financing statement or notice of a financing statement shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state. A debtor's residence is presumed to be the residence shown on the filing. The validity of the filing is not affected if the residence indicated is improper or inaccurate. The secretary of state shall mark the statement or notice with a consecutive file number and the date and hour of filing and shall hold the statement or notice for public inspection. In addition, the secretary of state shall index the statements and notices according to the name of the debtor and shall note in the index the file number and the address of the debtor given in the statement;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The secretary of state shall compile all statements or notices filed under this act into a master list containing the information specified in W.S. 34-21-1101(a)(v)(D);</p>
                  <p>(iii) The secretary of state shall distribute to registrants the information on the master list in lists by farm product arranged either alphabetically by debtor or numerically by the debtor's approved unique identification number. If a registered buyer so requests, the list or lists for such buyer may be limited to any county or group of counties where the farm product is used or produced or to any crop year or years or a combination of those identifiers;</p>
                  <p>(iv) All buyers of farm products, commission merchants, selling agents and other persons may register with the secretary of state to receive lists described in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section. Lists produced under the central filing system shall be used only for the purposes of this act. Any buyer of farm products, commission merchant, selling agent or other person conducting business from multiple locations shall be considered as one (1) entity. Registration shall be on an annual calendar year basis. The secretary of state shall provide the form for registration which shall include the name and address of the registrant and the list or lists described in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section which the registrant desires to receive. The form shall also include other information that the secretary of state may require to comply with section 1324 of the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99-198, 7 U.S.C. 1631 (Supp. 1988), or to more efficiently carry out his duties under this act. A registration shall not be completed until the form provided is properly completed and received by the secretary of state accompanied by the specified registration fee. A registrant shall pay an additional annual fee as specified under this act to receive monthly lists described in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section. A registration may be amended during the year by properly completing the prescribed form and submitting it along with the specified fee to the secretary of state. Registrants shall immediately notify the secretary of state of any change of address by filling out the proper form in order to continue to receive copies of the central filing system master list and to continue to be considered registered. The secretary of state shall maintain a record of the registrants and the lists and contents of the lists received by the registrants for a period of five (5) years;</p>
                  <p>(v) The lists requested by registrants under paragraph (a)(iv) of this section shall be distributed by the secretary of state on a monthly basis and shall be in written or printed form. The secretary of state may by rule provide for the distribution of the lists on any medium and establish reasonable charges therefor. The secretary of state shall, by rule, establish the dates upon which the monthly distribution will be made, the dates after which a filing of an effective financing statement will not be reflected on the next monthly distribution of lists and the dates by which a registrant must complete a registration to receive the next monthly list; and</p>

                  <p>(a) Whenever there is no outstanding secured obligation and no commitment to make advances, incur obligations or otherwise give value, the secured party shall notify the debtor in writing of his right to have a notice of lapse of his effective financing statement filed which shall lead to the removal of his name from the files and lists compiled by the secretary of state. In lieu of that notice, the secured party may acquire a waiver of the debtor of that right and a request by the debtor that his effective financing statement be retained on file. The notice may be given or waiver acquired by the secured party at any time prior to the time specified in this subsection for giving the notice.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the secured party does not furnish the notice or obtain the waiver specified in subsection (a) of this section, the secured party shall, within ten (10) days of final payment of all secured obligations, file a notice of termination with the secretary of state. The secured party shall on written demand by the debtor send the debtor a notice of termination to the effect that he no longer claims a security interest under the effective financing statement, which shall be identified by file number. The notice of termination is valid if signed by the secured party.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the affected secured party fails to send a notice of lapse within ten (10) days after proper demand under subsection (b) of this section, he is liable to the debtor for the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) and for any loss caused to the debtor by the failure.</p>
                  <p>(d) On presentation to the secretary of state of a notice of lapse, he shall treat it as a termination statement and note it in the index.</p>

                  <p>(a) In the case of a farm product produced in Wyoming, a buyer in the ordinary course of business buying farm products takes subject to a security interest created by the seller, and a commission merchant or selling agent who sells a farm product for others shall be subject to a security interest created by the seller in such farm product, if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The buyer, commission merchant or selling agent has failed to register with the secretary of state prior to the purchase of farm products, and the secured party has filed an effective financing statement or notice that covers the farm products being sold; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The buyer, commission merchant or selling agent received from the secretary of state written notice as provided in W.S. 34-21-1102(a)(v) that specifies both the seller and the farm products being sold by the seller as being subject to an effective financing statement or notice, and does not secure a waiver or release of the security interest specified in the effective financing statement or notice from the secured party by performing any payment obligation or otherwise. If a buyer in the ordinary course of business buying farm products covered by the central filing system tenders to the seller the total purchase price by means of a check or other instrument payable to the seller and each security interest holder of the seller identified in the central filing system for those products and if the security interest holder authorizes the negotiation of the check or other instrument, the authorization or endorsement and payment thereof constitutes a waiver or release of the security interest specified to the extent of the amount of the instrument.</p>
                  <p>(b) A buyer in the ordinary course of business buying farm products covered by the central filing system shall take subject to the security interest identified under the system, except that a registrant or a buyer in the ordinary course of business making an inquiry under W.S. 34-21-1105 shall not take subject to the security interest if the central filing system's failure to correctly provide any of the information specified in W.S. 34-21-1101(a)(v)(D) prevents the buyer from having knowledge of the effective financing statement.</p>

                <p>(A) A wall, clerestory or skylight window designed to transmit solar energy into a structure for heating purposes;</p>
                <p>(B) A greenhouse attached to another structure and designed to provide part of the heating load for the structure to which it is attached;</p>
                <p>(C) A trombe wall, "drum wall" or other wall or roof structural element designed to collect and transmit solar energy into a structure;</p>
                <p>(D) A photovoltaic collector designed to convert solar energy into electric energy;</p>
                <p>(E) A plate-type collector designed to use solar energy to heat air, water or other fluids for use in hot water or space heating or for other applications; or</p>
                <p>(F) A massive structural element designed to collect solar energy and transmit it to internal spaces for heating.</p>
                <p>(ii) "Solar right" is a property right to an unobstructed line-of-sight path from a solar collector to the sun which permits radiation from the sun to impinge directly on the solar collector. The extent of the solar right shall be described by that illumination provided by the path of the sun on the winter solstice day which is put to a beneficial use or otherwise limited by this act;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Winter solstice day" is the solstice on or about December 21 which marks the beginning of winter in the northern hemisphere and is the time when the sun reaches its southernmost point;</p>

                <p>(i) Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and the limit of the solar right, except as otherwise provided by written contract. If the amount of solar energy which a solar user can beneficially use varies with the season of the year, then the extent of the solar right shall vary likewise;</p>
                <p>(ii) Priority in time shall have the better right, except as provided in this act; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Nothing in this act diminishes the right of eminent domain.</p>

                <p>(a) The solar right to radiation of the sun before 9:00 a.m. or after 3:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time is de minimus and may be infringed without compensation to the owner of the solar collector.</p>
                <p>(b) A solar right which is not applied to a beneficial use for a period of five (5) years or more shall be deemed abandoned and without priority.</p>
                <p>(c) Solar collectors shall be located on the solar user's property so as not to unreasonably or unnecessarily restrict the uses of neighboring property. Unless otherwise permitted by the local government, no solar right attaches to a solar collector, or a portion of a solar collector, which would be shaded by a ten (10) foot wall located on the property line on a winter solstice day.</p>

                <p>(a) Land-use regulations of local governments may encourage the use of solar energy systems. To encourage the use of solar energy systems, local governments may regulate:</p>
                <p>(i) The height, location, setback and energy efficiency of structures;</p>
                <p>(ii) The height and location of vegetation with respect to property lines;</p>
                <p>(iii) The platting and orientation of land developments; and</p>
                <p>(iv) The type and location of energy systems or their components.</p>
                <p>(b) The local government shall establish permit systems for the use and application of solar energy. Where a local government establishes a permit system for the use and application of solar energy:</p>
                <p>(i) A solar permit shall be granted before a solar right may be established;</p>
                <p>(ii) The local government shall grant a solar permit to any proposed or existing solar collector which complies with this act. If a local government sets height or locational limits on structures or vegetation, the local government may restrict the solar permit to the airspace above or surrounding the restrictions. The extent of the solar right granted by this act shall not exceed the extent of the solar right granted by the solar permit;</p>
                <p>(iii) The solar right vests on the date the solar permit is granted. The solar collector shall be put to beneficial use within two (2) years except the local government may allow additional time for good cause shown. The local government shall certify the right and its beneficial use within two (2) years of its vesting;</p>
                <p>(iv) The priority of new construction with regard to interference in solar rights shall vest as of the date the building permit is applied for;</p>
                <p>(v) Cities and towns shall regulate solar rights within their boundaries. Counties shall regulate solar rights within the county and outside city limits. Local governments which agree may regulate solar rights jointly;</p>
                <p>(vi) Existing solar collector users shall apply for permits within five (5) years after the date permit systems are established by their local governments. The priority date for these solar rights shall be the first date the solar collector was beneficially used.</p>
                <p>(c) No local government shall prohibit the construction or use of solar collectors except for reasons of public health and safety or as authorized in W.S. 18-5-501 through 18-5-513.</p>

                <p>(d) The notice shall contain the lender's name, the lender's address, the date of the loan, a description of the property loaned, the name, address and telephone number of the appropriate office or official to be contacted at the museum for information regarding the loan, an explanation of the lender's responsibilities to notify the museum of any change of address or ownership pursuant to W.S. 34-23-103, an explanation of the lender's right to file a notice of intent to preserve an interest pursuant to W.S. 34-23-104 and an explanation of when a museum acquires title to property originally loaned to it as provided in W.S. 34-23-104(b).</p>

                <p>(f) If a museum holds loaned property acquired prior to July 1, 1982 which is not subject to a written loan agreement, and more than ten (10) years have elapsed without written donor contact indicating the deposit is not a gift, the deposit is presumed to be a gift. The presumption of a gift under this subsection may be rebutted by submission of written documentation by the lender prior to July 1, 1995 establishing that the deposit was a loan. Failure by the lender to submit documentation to the museum under this subsection prior to July 1, 1995 shall result in transfer of ownership of the loaned property to the museum.</p>

                <p>(a) The lender may file with a museum a notice of intent to preserve an interest in the property on loan to the museum within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice required in W.S. 34-23-102. Filing of the notice does not validate or make enforceable any claim which would be extinguished under the terms of a written loan agreement or which would otherwise be invalid or unenforceable. The notice of intent to preserve an interest shall be effective for ten (10) years. The museum shall notify the lender by certified mail, return receipt requested, within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the initial ten (10) year period covered by the lender's notice of intent to preserve an interest. The lender may extend his intent to preserve an interest for ten (10) years by filing another notice in accordance with this section.</p>
                <p>(b) Failure to timely file a notice of intent after notification by a museum as provided for in W.S. 34-23-102, or failure to timely refile a notice of intent within ten (10) years of the original filing of notice, or failure to claim loaned property at the termination of the loan period shall result in transfer to the museum of ownership of the loaned property.</p>
                <p>(c) Failure to file a notice of intent, or to refile a notice of intent within ten (10) years of the original filing of notice pursuant to this section, shall result in transfer to the museum of ownership of the loaned property immediately, or if any lending agreement is in effect the termination of any lending agreement.</p>
                <p>(d) Notice of intent to preserve an interest shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Be in writing;</p>
                <p>(ii) Contain a description of the property adequate to enable the museum to identify the property;</p>
                <p>(iii) Be accompanied by documentation sufficient to establish the lender as the owner of the property; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Be signed under penalty of perjury by the lender or by a person authorized to act on behalf of the lender.</p>
                <p>(e) A museum is not required to retain a notice of intent to preserve an interest which does not meet the requirements of subsection (d) of this section. Any museum not retaining the notice pursuant to this subsection shall promptly notify the lender at the address given on the notice of its determination that the notice is ineffective to preserve an interest and the reasons the notice is ineffective. Retention of a notice under this section is not an implication that the museum accepts the sufficiency or accuracy of the notice or that the notice is effective to preserve an interest in property on loan to the museum.</p>
                <p>(f) Unless the loaned property is returned to the lender, the museum shall retain the original or a copy of each notice to preserve an interest for a period of not less than ten (10) years.</p>
                <p>(g) The museum shall furnish any person filing notice under this section proof of receipt of notice by mailing a receipt to the lender at the address given on the notice within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice.</p>
                <p>(h) The provisions of this section are not intended to affect or alter the terms of a written loan agreement.</p>
                <p>(j) All rights and obligations of a lender in property loaned to a museum under this chapter shall pass to the lender's estate upon the death of the lender.</p>
                <p>(k) The notice requirements of this section do not apply to loaned property held by a museum pursuant to W.S. 34-23-102(f).</p>

                <p>(a) Funds held or owing under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract that has matured or terminated are deemed abandoned if unclaimed for more than five (5) years after the funds became due and payable as established from the records of the insurance company holding or owing the funds, but property described in paragraph (c)(ii) of this section is deemed abandoned if unclaimed for more than two (2) years.</p>
                <p>(b) If a person other than the insured or annuitant is entitled to the funds and an address of the person is not known to the company or it is not definite and certain from the records of the company who is entitled to the funds, it is presumed that the last known address of the person entitled to the funds is the same as the last known address of the insured or annuitant according to the records of the company.</p>
                <p>(c) For purposes of this act, a life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract not matured by actual proof of the death of the insured or annuitant according to the records of the company is matured and the proceeds due and payable if:</p>
                <p>(i) The company knows that the insured or annuitant has died; or</p>
                <p>(ii) It is determined that:</p>
                <p>(A) The insured has attained, or would have attained if living, the limiting age under the mortality table on which the reserve is based;</p>

                <p>(d) For purposes of this act, the application of an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision contained in an insurance policy does not prevent a policy from being matured or terminated under subsection (a) of this section if the insured has died or the insured or the beneficiary of the policy otherwise has become entitled to the proceeds thereof before the depletion of the cash surrender value of a policy by the application of those provisions.</p>
                <p>(e) If the laws of this state or the terms of the life insurance policy require the company to give notice to the insured or owner that an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision has been exercised and the notice, given to an insured or owner whose last known address according to the records of the company is in this state, is undeliverable, the company shall make a reasonable search to ascertain the policyholder's correct address to which the notice must be mailed.</p>
                <p>(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the company learns of the death of the insured or annuitant and the beneficiary has not communicated with the insurer within four (4) months after the death, the company shall take reasonable steps to pay the proceeds to the beneficiary.</p>
                <p>(g) Commencing two (2) years after the effective date of this act, every change of beneficiary form issued by an insurance company under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract to an insured or owner who is a resident of this state shall request the following information:</p>
                <p>(i) The name of each beneficiary, or if a class of beneficiaries is named, the name of each current beneficiary in the class;</p>
                <p>(ii) The address of each beneficiary; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The relationship of each beneficiary to the insured.</p>

                <p>(a) Any stock, shareholding, or other intangible ownership interest in a business association, the existence of which is evidenced by records available to the association, is deemed abandoned and, with respect to the interest, the association is the holder, if:</p>
                <p>(i) The interest in the association is owned by a person who for more than three (3) years has neither claimed a dividend, distribution or other sum payable as a result of the interest, or who has not communicated with the association regarding the interest or a dividend, distribution or other sum payable as the result of the interest, as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the association prepared by an employee of the association; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The association does not know the location of the owner at the end of the three (3) year period.</p>
                <p>(b) The return of official shareholder notifications or communications by the postal service as undeliverable shall be evidence that the association does not know the location of the owner.</p>
                <p>(c) This act shall be applicable to both the underlying stock, shareholdings or other intangible ownership interests of an owner, and any stock, shareholdings or other intangible ownership interest of which the business association is in possession of the certificate or other evidence or indicia of ownership, and to the stock, shareholdings or other intangible ownership interests of dividend and nondividend paying business associations whether or not the interest is represented by a certificate.</p>
                <p>(d) At the time an interest is deemed abandoned under this section, any dividend, distribution or other sum then held for or owing to the owner as a result of the interest, and not previously deemed abandoned, is deemed abandoned.</p>
                <p>(e) This act does not apply to any stock or other intangible ownership interest enrolled in a plan that provides for the automatic reinvestment of dividends, distributions or other sums payable as a result of the interest unless:</p>

                <p>(a) At the time of the filing of the report required by W.S. 34-24-118 and with that report, the person holding property deemed abandoned and subject to custody as unclaimed property shall pay or deliver to the administrator all of the property shown on the report and remaining unclaimed by the apparent owner. Upon written request showing good cause, the administrator may postpone the payment or delivery upon such terms or conditions as the administrator deems necessary and appropriate. The property paid or delivered to the administrator shall include all interest, dividends, increments and accretions due, payable or distributable on the property on November 1 of the year in which the report is required, except that interest accrued on a policy as defined in W.S. 26-16-505(k)(iii) or a retained asset account as defined in W.S. 26-16-505(k)(v) shall not be considered unclaimed property. If payment or delivery is postponed, the property paid or delivered to the administrator shall include all interest, dividends, increments and accretions due, payable or distributable on the day that the property is paid or delivered to the administrator.</p>
                <p>(b) The holder of an interest under W.S. 34-24-111 shall issue and deliver to the administrator a duplicate certificate or other evidence of ownership if the holder does not issue certificates of ownership, registered in the name of the Wyoming state treasurer. Upon delivery of a duplicate certificate to the administrator, the holder and any transfer agent, registrar or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder in executing or delivering the duplicate certificate or other evidence of ownership is relieved of all liability in accordance with W.S. 34-24-121 to every person, including any person acquiring the original certificate or the duplicate certificate issued to the administrator, for any losses or damages resulting to any person by the issuance and delivery of the duplicate certificate or other evidence of ownership to the administrator.</p>

                <p>(a) Upon the payment or delivery of property to the administrator, the state assumes custody and responsibility for the safekeeping of the property. A person who pays or delivers property to the administrator in good faith is relieved of all liability to the extent of the value of the property paid or delivered for any claim then existing or which thereafter may arise or be made in respect to the property. The person who pays or delivers in this manner shall not thereafter be liable for interest.</p>
                <p>(b) A holder who has paid money to the administrator pursuant to this act may make payment to any person appearing to the holder to be entitled to payment and, upon filing proof of payment and proof that the payee was entitled thereto, the administrator shall promptly reimburse the holder for the payment without imposing any fee or other charge. If reimbursement is sought for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a traveler's check or money order, the holder must be reimbursed under this subsection upon filing proof that the instrument was duly presented and that payment was made to a person who appeared to the holder to be entitled to payment. The holder shall be reimbursed for payment made under this subsection even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was barred under W.S. 34-24-130(a).</p>
                <p>(c) A holder who has delivered property (including a certificate of any interest in a business association) other than money to the administrator pursuant to this act may reclaim the property if still in the possession of the administrator, without paying any fee or other charge, upon filing proof that the owner has claimed the property from the holder.</p>
                <p>(d) The administrator may accept the holder's affidavit as sufficient proof of the facts that entitle the holder to recover money and property under this section.</p>
                <p>(e) If the holder pays or delivers property to the administrator in good faith and thereafter another person claims the property from the holder or another state claims the money or property under its laws relating to escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property, the administrator, upon written notice of the claim, shall defend the holder against the claim and indemnify the holder against any liability on the claim.</p>
                <p>(f) For the purposes of this section, "good faith" means that:</p>
                <p>(i) Payment or delivery was made in a reasonable attempt to comply with this act;</p>
                <p>(ii) The person delivering the property was not a fiduciary then in breach of trust in respect to the property and had a reasonable basis for believing, based on the facts then known to that person, that the property was abandoned for the purposes of this act; and</p>
                <p>(iii) There is no showing that the records pursuant to which the delivery was made did not meet reasonable commercial standards of practice in the industry.</p>
                <p>(g) Property removed from a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository is received by the administrator subject to the holder's right under this subsection to be reimbursed for the actual cost of the opening and to any valid lien or contract providing for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent, storage, or any other charges that are reasonable and related.</p>

                <p>(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the administrator, within three (3) years after the receipt of abandoned property, shall sell it to the highest bidder at public sale in whatever city in the state affords in the judgment of the administrator the most favorable market for the property involved. The administrator may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if in the judgment of the administrator the bid is insufficient. If in the judgment of the administrator the probable cost of sale exceeds the value of the property, it need not be offered for sale. Any sale held under this section shall be preceded by a single publication of notice, at least three (3) weeks in advance of sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is to be sold.</p>
                <p>(b) Securities listed on an established stock exchange shall be sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale on the exchange. Other securities may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any other method the administrator considers advisable.</p>
                <p>(c) Unless the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, all securities, other than those deemed abandoned under W.S. 34-24-111, delivered to the administrator shall be held for at least one (1) year before he may sell them.</p>
                <p>(d) Unless the administrator considers it to be in the best interest of the state to do otherwise, all securities deemed abandoned under W.S. 34-24-111 and delivered to the administrator shall be held for at least three (3) years before the administrator may sell them. If the administrator sells any securities delivered pursuant to W.S. 34-24-111 before the expiration of the three (3) year period, any person making a claim pursuant to this act before the end of the three (3) year period is entitled to either the proceeds of the sale of the securities or the market value of the securities at the time the claim is made, whichever amount is greater. A person making a claim under this act after the expiration of this period is entitled to receive either the securities delivered to the administrator by the holder, if they still remain in the hands of the administrator, or the proceeds received from sale, but no person has any claim under this act against the state, the holder, any transfer agent, registrar or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder for any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery by the holder to the administrator.</p>
                <p>(e) The purchaser of property at any sale conducted by the administrator pursuant to this act takes the property free of all claims of the owner or previous holder thereof and of all persons claiming through or under them. The administrator shall execute all documents necessary to complete the transfer of ownership.</p>

                <p>123.

                <p>(a) A person, excluding another state, claiming an interest in any property paid or delivered to the administrator may file with the administrator a claim on a form prescribed by the administrator and verified by the claimant.</p>
                <p>(b) The administrator shall consider each claim within ninety (90) days after it is filed and give written notice to the claimant if the claim is denied in whole or in part. The notice may be given by mailing it to the last address, if any, stated in the claim as the address to which notices are to be sent. If no address for notices is stated in the claim, the notice may be mailed to the last address, if any, of the claimant as stated in the claim. No notice of denial need be given if the claim fails to state either the last address to which notices are to be sent or the address of the claimant.</p>
                <p>(c) If a claim is allowed, the administrator shall pay over to the claimant the monies received from the holder, or the net proceeds if property has been sold by the administrator, together with any additional amount required by W.S. 34-24-122. If the claim is for property deemed abandoned under W.S. 34-24-111 which was sold by the administrator within three (3) years after the date of delivery, the amount payable for that claim is the value of the property at the time the claim was made or the net proceeds of sale, whichever is greater.</p>

                <p>(a) At any time after property has been paid or delivered to the administrator under this act another state may recover the property if:</p>
                <p>(i) The property was subjected to custody by this state because the records of the holder did not reflect the last known address of the apparent owner when the property was deemed abandoned under this act, and the other state establishes that the last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property was in that state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;</p>
                <p>(ii) The last known address of the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property, as reflected by the records of the holder, is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;</p>
                <p>(iii) The records of the holder were erroneous in that they did not accurately reflect the actual owner of the property and the last known address of the actual owner is in the other state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or was subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;</p>
                <p>(iv) The property was subjected to custody by this state under W.S. 34-24-104(a)(vi) and under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder the property has escheated to or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state; or</p>
                <p>(v) The property is the sum payable on a traveler's check, money order or other similar instrument that was subjected to custody by this state under W.S. 34-24-105, and the instrument was purchased in the other state and under the laws of that state the property escheated to or became subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.</p>
                <p>(b) The claim of another state to recover escheated or abandoned property must be presented in a form prescribed by the administrator, who shall decide the claim within ninety (90) days after it is presented. The administrator shall allow the claim if he determines that the other state is entitled to the abandoned property under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p>(c) The administrator shall require a state, before recovering property under this section, to agree to indemnify this state and its officers and employees against any liability on a claim for the property.</p>

                <p>(a) For purposes of more precisely defining the Wyoming Coordinate System NAD 1983 the following definition of the zones is adopted:</p>
                <p>(i) The Wyoming Coordinate System NAD 1983, East Zone, is a transverse Mercator projection of the North American Datum of 1983, having a central meridian at 105T10' West of Greenwich on which meridian the scale is set at one part in 16,000 exactly. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the parallel at 40r30' North Latitude and the meridian at 105310' West of Greenwich. This origin is given the coordinates: x=200,000 meters and y=0 meters;</p>
                <p>(ii) The Wyoming Coordinate System NAD 1983, East Central Zone, is a transverse Mercator projection of the North American Datum of 1983, having a central meridian at 107T20' West of Greenwich on which meridian the scale is set at one part in 16,000 exactly. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the parallel at 40y30' North Latitude and the meridian at 107320' West of Greenwich. This origin is given the coordinates: x=400,000 meters and y=100,000 meters;</p>
                <p>(iii) The Wyoming Coordinate System NAD 1983, West Central Zone, is a transverse Mercator projection of the North American Datum of 1983, having a central meridian at 108T45' West of Greenwich on which meridian the scale is set at one part in 16,000 exactly. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the parallel at 40l30' North Latitude and the meridian at 108345' West of Greenwich. This origin is given the coordinates: x=600,000 meters and y=0 meters;</p>
                <p>(iv) The Wyoming Coordinate System NAD 1983, West Zone, is a transverse Mercator projection of the North American Datum of 1983, having a central meridian at 110T05' West of Greenwich on which meridian the scale is set at one part in 16,000 exactly. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the parallel at 40o30' North Latitude and the meridian at 110305' West of Greenwich. This origin is given the coordinates: x=800,000 meters and y=100,000 meters.</p>
                <p>(b) The position of any survey control point in the Wyoming Coordinate System NAD 1983 shall be as marked on the ground by horizontal control stations established in conformity with standards adopted by the Federal Geodetic Control Committee, or its successors, using first-order, second-order or higher-order accuracy survey work, whose geodetic positions have been rigorously adjusted on the North American Datum of 1983 and whose coordinates have been computed on the system herein defined. Any such station may be used for establishing a connection with the Wyoming Coordinate System NAD 1983.</p>

                  <p>(c) In addition to the presumptive evidence established by W.S. 32-1-107 and as otherwise provided in this chapter, a certificate of a notarial act in a form as set out in W.S. 34-26-108 shall be presumptive evidence that:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the instrument to which the certificate is affixed was executed by natural persons acting in their own right, that such person or persons personally appeared before the notarial officer, were known to the officer to be the person or persons described in and who executed such instrument, and that the person or persons acknowledged that the document was acknowledged freely and voluntarily;</p>

                  <p>(iii) If the instrument to which the certificate is affixed was executed by a corporation or other entity which is not a natural person, that the president or other official who signed the instrument on behalf of the entity appeared before and was personally known to the officer making the certificate and was duly sworn and upon oath represented that the person was the president or other officer or agent of the corporation or entity, that the seal affixed to the instrument is the corporate seal of the corporation or entity, that the instrument was signed and sealed on behalf of the corporation or entity by the authority of the board of directors or trustees thereof and that the officer who executed the instrument acknowledged the instrument to be the free act and deed of the corporation or entity. If the corporation or entity does not have a corporate seal, a recital of that fact shall be inserted at the end of the certificate by the notarial officer.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34-29-102. Classification of digital assets as property; applicability to Uniform Commercial Code.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Digital assets are classified in the following manner:</p>
                <p>(i) Digital consumer assets are intangible personal property and shall be considered general intangibles, as defined in W.S. 34.1-9-102(a)(xlii), only for the purposes of article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes;</p>
                <p>(ii) Digital securities are intangible personal property and shall be considered securities, as defined in W.S. 34.1-8-102(a)(xv), and investment property, as defined in W.S. 34.1-9-102(a)(xlix), only for the purposes of articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes;</p>
                <p>(iii) Virtual currency is intangible personal property and shall be considered money, notwithstanding W.S. 34.1-1-201(b)(xxiv), only for the purposes of article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes.</p>
                <p>(b) Consistent with W.S. 34.1-8-102(a)(ix), a digital asset may be treated as a financial asset under that paragraph, pursuant to a written agreement with the owner of the digital asset.

                <p><shortTitle>34-29-103. Perfection of security interests in digital assets; control; possession; security agreements; location.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Notwithstanding the financing statement requirement specified by W.S. 34.1-9-310(a) as otherwise applied to general intangibles or any other provision of law, perfection of a security interest in virtual currency or digital securities may be achieved through possession or control, as applicable to the asset, consistent with W.S. 34-29-102(a). A security interest held by a secured party having possession or control, as applicable, of virtual currency or digital securities has priority over a security interest held by a secured party that does not have possession or control, as applicable of virtual currency or digital securities. Other provisions of law relating to priority of security interests, including priority of control over delivery, shall remain applicable.</p>
                <p>(b) Before a secured party may take possession or control under this section, the secured party shall enter into a security agreement with the debtor. The security agreement may set forth the terms under which a secured party may pledge its security interest as collateral for another transaction. Consistent with W.S. 34.1-9-201(a), the security agreement shall be effective according to its terms between parties, against purchasers of collateral and against creditors.</p>
                <p>(c) A secured party may file a financing statement with the secretary of state, including to perfect a security interest in proceeds from a digital asset pursuant to W.S. 34.1-9-315(d).</p>
                <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes, a transferee takes a digital asset free of any security interest two (2) years after the transferee takes the asset for value and does not have actual notice of an adverse claim. This subsection only applies to a security interest perfected by filing.</p>
                <p>(e) As used in this section:</p>
                <p>(i) "Control," when used in article 9, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes and this section, includes the following:</p>
                <p>(A) A secured party, or an agent, custodian, fiduciary or trustee of the party, has complied with W.S. 34.1- 8-106, including by means of a private key or the use of a multi-signature arrangement exclusive to the secured party or any substantially similar analogue;</p>
                <p>(B) Use of a smart contract created by a secured party to comply with W.S. 34.1-8-106. As used in this subparagraph, "smart contract" means an automated transaction, as defined in W.S. 40-21-102(a)(ii), or any substantially similar analogue, which is comprised of code, script or programming language that executes the terms of an agreement, and which may include taking custody of and transferring an asset, or issuing executable instructions for these actions, based on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of specified conditions.</p>
                <p>(ii) "Multi-signature arrangement" means a system of access control relating to a digital asset for the purposes of preventing unauthorized transactions relating to the asset, in which two (2) or more private keys are required to conduct a transaction, or any substantially similar analogue;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Private key" means a unique element of cryptographic data, or any substantially similar analogue, which is:</p>
                <p>(A) Held by a person;</p>
                <p>(B) Paired with a unique, publicly available element of cryptographic data; and</p>
                <p>(C) Associated with an algorithm that is necessary to carry out an encryption or decryption required to execute a transaction.</p>
                <p>(iv) "Possession," when used in article 9, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes and this section, includes use of a private key, a multi-signature arrangement exclusive to the secured party or a smart contract, as defined in this subsection, or any substantially similar analogue. "Possession" shall also include delivery of certificated digital securities, consistent with W.S. 34.1-8-301(a).</p>
                <p>(f) Perfection by possession creates a possessory security interest under W.S. 34.1-9-301(a)(ii) in virtual currency or certificated digital securities, based on the possessory nature of a private key or any substantially similar analogue, which may be tangible or electronic.</p>
                <p>(g) For purposes of article 9, title 34.1 and this section, if collateral is required to be "located in a jurisdiction," a digital asset is located in Wyoming if the asset is possessed, controlled or otherwise held by a Wyoming bank, trust company or other custodian, the debtor or secured party is physically located in Wyoming or the debtor or secured party is incorporated or organized in Wyoming, based on the following factors:</p>
                <p>(i) Whether a security agreement typically present in a possessory security interest exists, consistent with W.S. 34.1-9-201(a), including an agreement describing the possessory nature of a private key or any substantially similar analogue;</p>
                <p>(ii) The choice of law in a security agreement, evidencing the intent and understanding of the parties relating to all potential aspects of a transaction, including waivers of litigation in jurisdictions other than Wyoming, access to the Wyoming chancery court and judicial economy; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The relative clarity of the laws of other jurisdictions relating to a digital asset, consequences relating to unknown liens in those jurisdictions and the ability of a court to exercise jurisdiction over a particular digital asset.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>34-29-104. Digital asset custodial services.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) A bank may provide custodial services consistent with this section upon providing sixty (60) days written notice to the commissioner. The provisions of this section are cumulative and not exclusive as an optional framework for enhanced supervision of digital asset custody. If a bank elects to provide custodial services under this section, it shall comply with all provisions of this section.</p>
                <p>(b) A bank may serve as a qualified custodian, as specified by the United States securities and exchange commission in 17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-2, or as a custodian authorized by the United States commodity futures trading commission or other law. In performing custodial services under this section, a bank shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Implement all accounting, account statement, internal control, notice and other standards specified by applicable state or federal law and rules for custodial services;</p>
                <p>(ii) Maintain information technology best practices relating to digital assets held in custody. The commissioner may specify required best practices by rule;</p>
                <p>(iii) Fully comply with applicable federal anti-money laundering, customer identification and beneficial ownership requirements; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Take other actions necessary to carry out this section, which may include exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks and ensuring compliance with federal law governing digital assets classified as commodities.</p>
                <p>(c) A bank providing custodial services shall conform to the audit, accounting and related requirements specified by the commissioner and applicable law, which may include entering into an agreement with an independent public accountant to conduct an examination conforming to the requirements of 17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-2(a)(4) and (6), at the cost of the bank. An accountant shall transmit the results of any examination to the commissioner within one hundred twenty (120) days of the examination and may file the results with other regulatory agencies as their rules may provide. Material discrepancies in an examination shall be reported to the commissioner within one (1) day. The commissioner shall review examination results upon receipt within a reasonable time and during any regular examination conducted under W.S. 13-3-702.</p>
                <p>(d) Digital assets held in custody under this section are not depository liabilities or assets of the bank. A bank, or a subsidiary, may register as an investment adviser, investment company or broker dealer as necessary. A bank shall maintain control over a digital asset while in custody. A customer shall elect, pursuant to a written agreement with the bank, one (1) of the following relationships for each digital asset held in custody:</p>
                <p>(i) Custody under a bailment as a nonfungible or fungible asset. Assets held under this paragraph shall be strictly segregated from other assets; or</p>
                <p>(ii) Custody under a bailment pursuant to subsection</p>
                <p>(e) of this section.</p>
                <p>(e) If a customer makes an election under paragraph (d)(ii) of this section, the bank may, based only on customer instructions, undertake transactions with the digital asset. A bank maintains control pursuant to subsection (d) of this section by entering into an agreement with the counterparty to a transaction which contains a time for return of the asset. The bank shall not be liable for any loss suffered with respect to a transaction under this subsection, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers.</p>
                <p>(f) A bank and a customer shall agree in writing regarding the source code version the bank will use for each digital asset, and the treatment of each asset under the Uniform Commercial Code, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes if necessary. Any ambiguity under this subsection shall be resolved in favor of the customer.</p>
                <p>(g) A bank shall provide clear, written notice to each customer, and require written acknowledgement, of the following:</p>
                <p>(i) Prior to the implementation of any updates, material source code updates relating to digital assets held in custody, except in emergencies which may include security vulnerabilities;</p>
                <p>(ii) The heightened risk of loss from transactions under subsection (e) of this section;</p>
                <p>(iii) That some risk of loss as a pro rata creditor exists as the result of custody as a fungible asset or custody under paragraph (d)(ii) of this section;</p>
                <p>(iv) That custody under paragraph (d)(ii) of this section may not result in the digital assets of the customer being strictly segregated from other customer assets; and</p>
                <p>(v) That the bank is not liable for losses suffered under subsection (e) of this section, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers.</p>
                <p>(h) A bank and a customer shall agree in writing to a time period within which the bank must return a digital asset held in custody under this section. If a customer makes an election under paragraph (d)(ii) of this section, the bank and the customer may also agree in writing to the form in which the digital asset shall be returned.</p>
                <p>(j) All ancillary or subsidiary proceeds relating to digital assets held in custody under this section shall accrue to the benefit of the customer, except as specified by a written agreement with the customer. The bank may elect not to collect certain ancillary or subsidiary proceeds, as long as the election is disclosed in writing. A customer who makes an election under paragraph (d)(i) of this section may withdraw the digital asset in a form that permits the collection of the ancillary or subsidiary proceeds.</p>
                <p>(k) A bank shall not authorize or permit rehypothecation of digital assets under this section. The bank shall not engage in any activity to use or exercise discretionary authority relating to a digital asset except based on customer instructions.</p>
                <p>(m) A bank shall not take any action under this section which would likely impair the solvency or the safety and soundness of the bank, as determined by the commissioner after considering the nature of custodial services customary in the banking industry.</p>
                <p>(n) To offset the costs of supervision and administration of this section, a bank which provides custodial services under this section shall pay a supervision fee equal to two-tenths of one mill on the dollar ($.0002) relating to assets held in custody as provided by rule of the commissioner. The supervision fee shall be deposited by the commissioner into the financial institutions administration account and may be expended for any purpose authorized for that account.</p>
                <p>(o) The commissioner may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>
                <p>(p) As used in this section:</p>
                <p>(i) "Bank" has the meaning ascribed to it in W.S. 13- 1-101(a)(i);</p>
                <p>(ii) "Commissioner" means the banking commissioner;</p>
                <p>(iii) "Custodial services" means the safekeeping, servicing and management of customer currency and digital assets. This term includes the exercise of fiduciary and trust powers involving the exercise of discretion, including transactions under subsection (e) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) This section may be cited as the "Wyoming Utility Token Act."</p>
                <p>(b) An open blockchain token with the following characteristics constitutes intangible personal property:</p>
                <p>(i) The predominant purpose of the token is consumptive, as defined in paragraph (g)(ii) of this section;</p>
                <p>(ii) The developer or seller did not market the token to the initial buyer as a financial investment, as defined in paragraph (g)(v) of this section; and</p>
                <p>(iii) At least one (1) of the following subparagraphs is satisfied:</p>
                <p>(A) The developer or seller reasonably believed that it sold the token to the initial buyer for a consumptive purpose;</p>
                <p>(B) The token has a consumptive purpose that is available at or near the time of sale and can be used at or near the time of sale for a consumptive purpose;</p>
                <p>(C) The initial buyer of the token is prohibited by the developer or seller of the token from reselling the token until the token is available to be used for a consumptive purpose;</p>
                <p>(D) The developer or seller takes other reasonable precautions to prevent an initial buyer from purchasing the token as a financial investment.</p>
                <p>(c) Before making an open blockchain token under subsection (b) of this section available for sale, the developer or seller of a token, or the registered agent of the developer or seller, shall electronically file a notice of intent with the secretary of state and pay a filing fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) to offset the costs of administering this section. The notice of intent shall contain the name of the person acting as a developer or seller, the contact information of the person, or the registered agent of the person and comprehensive details on the open blockchain token under subsection (b) of this section made available for sale, as required by the secretary of state. A form shall be made available by the secretary of state for this purpose, which shall include a secure electronic form conspicuously posted on the internet website of the secretary of state. A developer, seller and the registered agent of these persons, if applicable, shall have a continuing duty to update the contact information provided on a notice of intent as long as the open blockchain token associated with the notice is actively being sold.</p>
