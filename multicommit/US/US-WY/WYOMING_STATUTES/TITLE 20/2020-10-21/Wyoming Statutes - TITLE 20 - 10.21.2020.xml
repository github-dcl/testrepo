                  <p>(a) Before solemnization of any marriage in this state, a marriage license shall be obtained from a Wyoming county clerk.</p>
                  <p>(b) Application for a marriage license shall be made by one (1) of the parties to the marriage before the license is issued. Upon receipt of an application, the county clerk shall ascertain by the testimony of a competent witness and the applicant, the names, the social security numbers of the parties who have valid social security numbers, residences and ages of the parties and whether there is any legal impediment to the parties entering into the marriage contract according to the laws of the state of their residence. The clerk shall enter the facts ascertained in a book kept by him for that purpose, except for the social security numbers which shall be provided to the state office of vital records and not made a part of the county public record. He may issue a license to marry and shall date the license on the date of issuance except as otherwise provided.</p>
                  <p>(c) Unless there is an order to waive the requirements of this section by a judge of a court of record in the county pursuant to W.S. 20-1-105, the clerk shall refuse to issue a license if:</p>
                  <p>(i) Either of the parties is legally incompetent to enter into a marriage contract according to the law of this state; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) There is any legal impediment; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Either party is a minor and the consent of a parent or guardian has not been given.</p>
                  <p>(d) A marriage license obtained from a Wyoming county clerk shall expire one (1) year from the date the license was issued if the parties have not solemnized the marriage. The expiration date shall be shown on the marriage license. Upon expiration of a marriage license, the parties shall apply for and obtain a new marriage license before solemnization of their marriage in this state.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-1-105. Judge may order license issued.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If any county clerk refuses to issue a license to marry, or in case of circumstances arising which would necessitate the waiver of any one (1) or more of the requirements of W.S. 20-1-102 and 20-1-103(b) and (c), either applicant for the license may apply to the district court of the county for the issuance of a license without compliance with one (1) or more of those requirements. If the judge finds that a license should be issued, or such circumstances exist that it is proper that any one (1) or more of the requirements should be waived, the judge may order in writing the issuance of the license. Upon the order of the judge being filed with the county clerk, the county clerk shall issue the license at the time specified in the order. No fee or court costs shall be charged or taxed for the order.</p>
                  <p>(b) If either party is under sixteen (16) years of age, the parents or guardians may apply to any judge of a court of record in the county of residence of the minor for an order authorizing the marriage and directing the issuance of a marriage license. If the judge believes it advisable, he shall enter an order authorizing the marriage and directing the county clerk to issue a license. Upon filing of a certified copy of the order with the county clerk, the county clerk shall issue a license and endorse thereon the fact of the issuance of the order. No person authorized to perform marriage ceremonies in Wyoming shall perform any marriage ceremony if either party is under the age specified by this subsection unless the license contains the endorsement.</p>
                  <p>(c) Before issuing the order provided by this section the judge may require affidavits or other proof of the competency of the parties or of any other facts necessitating or making the order advisable. The order may be in substantially the following form:</p>
                  <p>I ...., the undersigned ...., a judge of the .... court, a court of record in and for .... county, Wyoming, hereby order that a marriage license may issue to .... of .... (address) and.............. of.... (address) on the .... day of .... (year) Date: .....</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-2-101. Void and voidable marriages defined; annulments.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Marriages contracted in Wyoming are void without any decree of divorce:</p>
                  <p>(i) When either party has a husband or wife living at the time of contracting the marriage;</p>
                  <p>(ii) When either party is mentally incompetent at the time of contracting the marriage;</p>
                  <p>(iii) When the parties stand in the relation to each other of parent and child, grandparent and grandchild, brother and sister of half or whole blood, uncle and niece, aunt and nephew, or first cousins, whether either party is illegitimate. This paragraph does not apply to persons not related by consanguinity.</p>
                  <p>(b) A marriage is voidable if solemnized when either party was under the age of legal consent unless a judge gave consent, if they separated during nonage and did not cohabit together afterwards, or if the consent of one (1) of the parties was obtained by force or fraud and there was no subsequent voluntary cohabitation of the parties.</p>
                  <p>(c) Either party may file a petition in the district court of the county where the parties or one (1) of them reside, to annul a marriage for reasons stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and proceedings shall be held as in the case of a petition for divorce except as otherwise provided. Upon due proof the marriage shall be declared void by a decree of nullity.</p>
                  <p>(d) An action to annul a marriage on the ground that one of the parties was under the age of legal consent provided by W.S. 20-1-102(a) may be filed by the parent or guardian entitled to the custody of the minor. The marriage may not be annulled on the application of a party who was of the age of legal consent at the time of the marriage nor when it appears that the parties, after they had attained the age of consent, had freely cohabited as man and wife.</p>
                  <p>(e) An action to annul a marriage on the grounds of mental incompetency may be commenced on behalf of a mentally incompetent person by his guardian or next friend. A mentally incompetent person restored to competency may maintain an action of annulment, but no decree may be granted if the parties freely cohabited as husband and wife after restoration of competency.</p>
                  <p>(f) An action to annul a marriage on the grounds of physical incapacity may only be maintained by the injured party against the party whose incapacity is alleged and may only be commenced within two (2) years from the solemnization of the marriage.</p>
                  <p>(g) All decrees of annulment may include provisions for the custody and support of children pursuant to this article, W.S. 20-2-201 through 20-2-204 and 20-2-301 through 20-2-315 and for the division of property pursuant to W.S. 20-2-114.</p>

                  <p>When the husband and wife are living separately, or when they are living together but one (1) spouse does not support the other spouse or children within his means, and no proceeding for divorce is pending, the other spouse or the department of family services may institute a proceeding for support. No less than five (5) days after notice is personally served upon the nonsupporting spouse, the court may hear the petition and grant such order concerning the support of the spouse or children as it might grant were it based on a proceeding for divorce. If the nonsupporting spouse cannot be personally served within this state but has property within the jurisdiction of the court, or debts owing to him, the court may order such constructive service as appears sufficient and proper and may cause an attachment of the property. Upon completion of constructive service the court may grant relief as if personal service was had.</p>

                  <p>(a) A divorce may be granted when either party has become incurably insane and the insane person has been confined in a mental hospital of this state or of another state or territory for at least two (2) years immediately preceding the commencement of the action for divorce.</p>
                  <p>(b) Upon the filing of a verified complaint showing that a cause of action exists under this section, the district court shall appoint some person to act as guardian of the insane person in the action. The summons and complaint in the action shall be served upon the defendant by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the guardian and to the county attorney of the county in which the action is brought.</p>
                  <p>(c) The county attorney upon whom the summons and complaint is served shall appear for and defend the defendant in the action. No divorce shall be granted under this section except in the presence of the county attorney.</p>
                  <p>(d) In any action brought under this section, the district courts possess all the powers relative to the payment of alimony, the distribution of property and the care, custody and maintenance of the children of the parties as in other actions for divorce.</p>
                  <p>(e) Costs in the action, as well as the actual expenses of the county attorney and the expenses and fees of the guardian, shall be paid by the plaintiff.

                  <p>(a) When circumstances are such that grounds for a divorce exist, the aggrieved party may institute a proceeding by complaint in the same manner as if petitioner were seeking a decree of divorce, but praying instead to be allowed to live separate and apart from the offending party.</p>
                  <p>(b) No separation by decree entered hereunder shall be grounds for a divorce on the grounds of desertion or two (2) year separation unless those grounds existed at the time of petitioning for judicial separation. A decree of divorce may be granted after the decree of judicial separation is entered upon proper grounds arising thereafter.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court may make such orders as appear just, including custody of the children, provision for support, disposition of the properties of the parties, alimony, restraint of one (1) or both spouses during litigation and restraint of disposition of property.

                  <p>(a) In a proceeding for divorce, the court may cause the attendance of either party and compel an answer under oath concerning his property, rights or interests, or money that he may have or money due or to become due to him from others, and make such order thereon as is just and equitable.

The court may decree to either party reasonable alimony out of the estate of the other having regard for the other's ability to pay and may order so much of the other's real estate or the rents and profits thereof as is necessary be assigned and set out to either party for life, or may decree a specific sum be paid by either party.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-2-201. Disposition and maintenance of children in decree or order; access to records.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) In granting a divorce, separation or annulment of a marriage or upon the establishment of paternity pursuant to W.S. 14-2-401 through 14-2-907, the court may make by decree or order any disposition of the children that appears most expedient and in the best interests of the children. In determining the best interests of the child, the court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) The quality of the relationship each child has with each parent;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The ability of each parent to provide adequate care for each child throughout each period of responsibility, including arranging for each child's care by others as needed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The relative competency and fitness of each parent;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Each parent's willingness to accept all responsibilities of parenting, including a willingness to accept care for each child at specified times and to relinquish care to the other parent at specified times;</p>
                  <p>(v) How the parents and each child can best maintain and strengthen a relationship with each other;</p>
                  <p>(vi) How the parents and each child interact and communicate with each other and how such interaction and communication may be improved;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The ability and willingness of each parent to allow the other to provide care without intrusion, respect the other parent's rights and responsibilities, including the right to privacy;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Geographic distance between the parents' residences;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The current physical and mental ability of each parent to care for each child;</p>
                  <p>(x) Any other factors the court deems necessary and relevant.</p>
                  <p>(b) In any proceeding in which the custody of a child is at issue the court shall not prefer one (1) parent as a custodian solely because of gender.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court shall consider evidence of spousal abuse or child abuse as being contrary to the best interest of the children. If the court finds that family violence has occurred, the court shall make arrangements for visitation that best protects the children and the abused spouse from further harm.</p>
                  <p>(d) The court shall order custody in well defined terms to promote understanding and compliance by the parties. In determining custody a court shall not favor or disfavor any form of custody. Custody shall be crafted to promote the best interests of the children, and may include any combination of joint, shared or sole custody.</p>
                  <p>(e) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the noncustodial parent shall have the same right of access as the parent awarded custody to any records relating to the child of the parties, including school records, activities, teachers and teachers' conferences as well as medical and dental treatment providers and mental health records.</p>
                  <p>(f) At any time the court may require parents to attend appropriate parenting classes, including but not limited to, parenting classes to lessen the effects of divorce on children.</p>
                  <p>(g) At anytime a court is considering the custody or visitation rights of a service member, as defined by W.S. 20-2-205, the court shall comply with W.S. 20-2-205.</p>
                  <p>(h) A court finding of physical placement of a child in a child support order shall not be considered a disposition of custody under this section.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-2-203. Jurisdiction for enforcement and modification.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A court in this state which enters a custody order under W.S. 20-2-201 has continuing subject matter jurisdiction to enforce or modify the decree concerning the care, custody and visitation of the children as the circumstances of the parents and needs of the child require, subject to the provisions of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. A service member's temporary duty, deployment or mobilization, as defined in W.S. 20-2-205, shall not alter any court's continuing jurisdiction under this section. A court which has jurisdiction to enforce or modify an order under this section may decline to exercise its jurisdiction if it finds it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances of the case and that the court which entered the original order is a more appropriate forum and has jurisdiction as set forth in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.</p>
                  <p>(b) A court in any county in Wyoming in which the child has lived with his parents, a parent or a person acting as a parent for six (6) consecutive months immediately prior to commencement of the custody proceeding may assert subject matter jurisdiction and adjudicate any proceedings involving the child. Periods of temporary absence of any of the named persons shall be included as part of the six (6) month period.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any party seeking to enforce or modify a custody order pursuant to this section shall attach a certified copy of the custody order to the petition to be enforced or modified. A certified copy of an order entered by a Wyoming court providing for the care, custody or visitation of children may be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of any county in this state in which either parent resides if neither parent resides in the county of original jurisdiction. The district court for the county in which the order is filed has jurisdiction to enforce the order, provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) Upon request of the district court for the county in which a certified copy of the order has been filed, the court which originally entered the order shall forward certified copies of the transcript of the court record and pleadings, orders, decrees, records of hearings, social studies and other pertinent documents relating to the original proceeding; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The district court for the county in which a certified copy of the order has been filed shall give due consideration to the transcript of the record and all other documents submitted to it in accordance with paragraph (i) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(d) In any proceeding to enforce or modify an order concerning the care, custody and visitation of children, any required notice or pleading shall be served as provided by the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

                  <p>(a) Either parent may petition to enforce or modify any court order regarding custody and visitation.</p>
                  <p>(b) A court having jurisdiction under W.S. 20-2-203 may, upon appropriate motion of a party, require a parent to appear before the court and show just cause why the parent should not be held in contempt, upon a showing that the parent has willfully violated an order concerning the care, custody and visitation of the children. In order to enforce and require future compliance with an order the court may find that the parent is in contempt of court, award attorney's fees, costs and any other relief as the court may deem necessary under the circumstances to the party aggrieved by the violation of an order.</p>
                  <p>(c) A court having jurisdiction may modify an order concerning the care, custody and visitation of the children if there is a showing by either parent of a material change in circumstances since the entry of the order in question and that the modification would be in the best interests of the children pursuant to W.S. 20-2-201(a). In any proceeding in which a parent seeks to modify an order concerning child custody or visitation, proof of repeated, unreasonable failure by the custodial parent to allow visitation to the other parent in violation of an order may be considered as evidence of a material change of circumstances. Any modification under this subsection shall be subject to the limitations and requirements of W.S. 20-2-205.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-2-205. Temporary military duty; definitions; modification of orders; visitation assignment; electronic evidence.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) When a service member who has custody or visitation of a child receives temporary duty, deployment or mobilization orders from the military which require the service member to move a substantial distance from the service member's residence or otherwise have a temporary but material effect on the service member's ability to exercise custody or visitation responsibilities:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any order establishing the terms of custody or visitation in place at the time the service member receives the temporary duty, deployment or mobilization orders may only be temporarily modified so as to provide for the child's best interests;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any order modifying an existing custody or visitation order that is determined necessary due to the temporary duty, deployment or mobilization of a service member shall specify that the service member's military service is the basis for the order and shall further state that it is entered by the court solely as a temporary order;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In issuing any temporary custody or visitation order under this section, the court shall consider whether the temporary order should automatically terminate;</p>
                  <p>(iv) For purposes of determining custody and visitation after the return of a service member and upon motion under W.S. 20-2-204, the temporary duty, mobilization or deployment of the service member, and the resulting temporary disruption to a child's schedule, shall be neutral factors in determining a material change in circumstances and shall not, alone, constitute a material change in circumstances warranting a permanent modification of custody or visitation rights.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a service member with visitation rights receives temporary duty, deployment or mobilization orders that require the service member to move a substantial distance from the service member's residence or otherwise have a material effect on the service member's ability to exercise visitation rights, the court may, upon motion of the service member, order that the service member's visitation rights, or a portion thereof, may be exercised by a family member with a close and substantial relationship to the minor child for the duration of the service member's absence, if the alternate visitation is in the child's best interest.</p>
                  <p>(c) Upon motion of a service member who has received temporary duty, deployment or mobilization orders, the court shall, for good cause shown, expedite any pending hearing in custody and visitation matters when the military duties of the service member have a material effect on the service member's ability, or anticipated ability, to appear in person at a regularly scheduled hearing.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon motion of a service member who has received temporary duty, deployment or mobilization orders together with reasonable advanced notice and proof that the service member's military duties have a material effect on his ability to appear in person, the court may allow the service member to present testimony and evidence by electronic means in pending custody and visitation matters. The phrase "electronic means" includes communication by telephone, video teleconference or the Internet.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in this section shall alter the duty of the court to consider the best interest of the child in deciding custody or visitation matters.</p>
                  <p>(f) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Deployment" means federal service of the United States under title 10, United States Code, in compliance with military orders received by a service member to report for combat operations, contingency operations, peacekeeping operations, a temporary duty assignment or other federal service for which the service member is required to report and to be unaccompanied by family members. "Deployment" also shall encompass any federal service that includes a period during which a service member is listed by the United States department of defense as missing in action, a prisoner of war or remains subject to his deployment orders on account of security sequestration, sickness, wounds, leave or other lawful cause. The term shall not apply to any service member who is absent without leave or considered a deserter from the armed forces;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Mobilization" means the recall to active duty of a retired service member or the call-up of a national guard or reserve component service member to extended active duty status pursuant to title 10 United States Code, sections 12301, 12302, 12303 and 12304. "Mobilization" does not include national guard or reserve annual or weekend training;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Return" means official release or termination of temporary duty, deployment or mobilization orders or the resumption of a service member's physical presence within the state of Wyoming or state of permanent residence if other than Wyoming. "Return" does not include presence during temporary leave periods;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Service member" means a uniformed member of the United States army, navy, air force, marine corps, coast guard, United States public health service commissioned corps, national oceanic and atmospheric administration commissioned corp, national guard or any reserve or auxiliary component thereof;</p>
                  <p>(v) "Temporary duty" means the temporary transfer of a service member from one (1) military installation to a different location for a period of more than forty-five (45) days but less than one hundred eighty (180) days in order to accomplish training, assist in the performance of any military mission or for medical treatment.</p>

                  <p>(a) Child support shall be expressed in a specific dollar amount. The following child support tables shall be used to determine the total child support obligation considering the combined income of both parents. The appropriate table is based upon the number of children for whom the parents share joint legal responsibility and for whom support is being sought. After the combined net income of both parents is determined it shall be used in the first column of the tables to find the appropriate line from which the total child support obligation of both parents can be computed from the third column. The child support obligation computed from the third column of the tables shall be divided between the parents in proportion to the net income of each. The noncustodial parent's share of the joint child support obligation shall be paid to the custodial parent through the clerk as defined by W.S. 20-6-102(a)(x):</p>

                  <p>(b) Repealed by Laws 2018, ch. 42, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(c) When each parent keeps the children overnight for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the year and both parents contribute substantially to the expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support, a shared responsibility child support obligation shall be determined by multiplying the parents' total child support obligation as derived from subsection (a) of this section by one hundred fifty percent (150%). After the shared responsibility child support obligation is determined, that amount shall be divided between the parents in proportion to the net income of each. The proportionate share of the total obligation of each parent shall then be multiplied by the percentage of time the children spend with the other parent to determine the theoretical support obligation owed to the other parent. The parent owing the greater amount of child support shall pay the difference between the two (2) amounts as the net child support obligation.</p>
                  <p>(d) When each parent has physical custody of at least one (1) of the children, a shared responsibility child support obligation for all of the children shall be determined by use of the tables. The shared responsibility child support amount shall be divided by the number of children to determine the presumptive support obligation for each child, which amount shall then be allocated to each parent based upon the number of those children in the physical custody of that parent. That sum shall be multiplied by the percentage that the other parent's net income bears to the total net income of both parents. The obligations so determined shall then be offset, with the parent owing the larger amount paying the difference between the two (2) amounts to the other parent as a net child support obligation.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a proportion of a support obligor's social security or veteran's benefit is paid directly to the custodian of the obligor's dependents who are the subject of the child support order, the total amount of the social security or veteran's benefit, including the amounts paid to the obligor and custodian under the child support order, shall be counted as gross income to the obligor. However, in determining the support amount, the amount of the social security or veteran's benefit sent directly to the custodian shall be subtracted from the obligor's share of presumptive support. If the subtraction of the social security or veteran's benefit sent directly to the custodian results in a negative dollar amount, the support amount shall be set at zero. The child support obligation shall be offset by the amount of the social security or veteran's benefit sent directly to the custodian, beginning from the time the custodian began receiving the social security or veteran's benefit. The obligor or the department of family services may apply to the court to receive a credit against arrears for any social security or veteran's benefits that are paid retroactively to the custodian. For purposes of this subsection, "custodian" means the custodian of dependent children under a child support order and the physical custodian of dependent children who are the subject of a child support order.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the difference between the obligor's net income and the self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from the tables in subsection (a) of this section, the support obligation shall be set using the difference between the obligor's net income and the self-support reserve. As used in this subsection "self-support reserve" means the current poverty line for one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the Federal Register by the United States department of health and human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-2-307. Presumptive child support to be followed; deviations by court.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The presumptive child support established by W.S. 20-2-304 shall be rebuttably presumed to be the correct amount of child support to be awarded in any proceeding to establish or modify temporary or permanent child support amounts. Every order or decree providing for the support of a child shall set forth the presumptive child support amount and shall state whether the order or decree departs from that amount.</p>
                  <p>(b) A court may deviate from the presumptive child support established by W.S. 20-2-304 upon a specific finding that the application of the presumptive child support would be unjust or inappropriate in that particular case. In any case where the court has deviated from the presumptive child support, the reasons therefor shall be specifically set forth fully in the order or decree. In determining whether to deviate from the presumptive child support established by W.S. 20-2-304, the court shall consider the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) The age of the child;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The cost of necessary child day care;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any special health care and educational needs of the child;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The responsibility of either parent for the support of other children, whether court ordered or otherwise;</p>
                  <p>(v) The value of services contributed by either parent;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Any expenses reasonably related to the mother's pregnancy and confinement for that child, if the parents were never married or if the parents were divorced prior to the birth of the child;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The cost of transportation of the child to and from visitation;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The ability of either or both parents to furnish health, dental and vision insurance through employment benefits;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The amount of time the child spends with each parent;</p>
                  <p>(x) Any other necessary expenses for the benefit of the child;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Whether either parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed. In such case the child support shall be computed based upon the potential earning capacity (imputed income) of the unemployed or underemployed parent. In making that determination the court shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(A) Prior employment experience and history;</p>
                  <p>(B) Educational level and whether additional education would make the parent more self-sufficient or significantly increase the parent's income;</p>
                  <p>(C) The presence of children of the marriage in the parent's home and its impact on the earnings of that parent;</p>
                  <p>(D) Availability of employment for which the parent is qualified;</p>
                  <p>(E) Prevailing wage rates in the local area;</p>
                  <p>(F) Special skills or training; and</p>
                  <p>(G) Whether the parent is realistically able to earn imputed income.</p>
                  <p>(xii) Whether or not either parent has violated any provision of the divorce decree, including visitation provisions, if deemed relevant by the court; and</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Other factors deemed relevant by the court.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the parties fail to agree that the presumptive child support amount under W.S. 20-2-304 is appropriate, the court may order the party seeking to deviate from the presumptive child support amount to pay reasonable attorney fees and court costs to the other party unless, after hearing the evidence and considering the factors contained in subsection (b) of this section, the court deviates from the presumptive support amount.</p>
                  <p>(d) Agreements regarding child support may be submitted to the court. All such agreements shall be accompanied by a financial affidavit as required by W.S. 20-2-308. The court shall use the presumed child support amounts to review the adequacy of child support agreements negotiated by the parties. If the agreed amount departs from the presumed child support, the parties shall furnish statements of explanation which shall be included with the forms and shall be filed with the court. The court shall review the agreement and inform the parties whether or not additional or corrected information is needed, or that the agreement is approved or disapproved. No agreement which is less than the presumed child support amount shall be approved if means tested sources of income such as aid under the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program, health care benefits under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, supplemental nutrition assistance program, supplemental security income (SSI) or other similar benefits are being paid on behalf of any of the children.</p>

                  <p>(a) In any proceeding to enforce the decree concerning the maintenance of children, any required notice or pleading shall be served as provided by the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
                  <p>(b) A court may, upon appropriate motion, require a parent to appear before the court and show just cause why the parent should not be held in contempt and, upon a showing that the parent has willfully violated a child support order, make such order or orders as the court deems necessary and appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(c) In any case in which child support has been ordered to be paid to the clerk, any periodic payment or installment under the provisions of an order concerning maintenance is, on the date it is due, a judgment by operation of law.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-2-311. Adjustment of child support orders.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any party, or the department of family services in the case of child support orders being enforced by the department, may petition for a review and adjustment of any child support order that was entered more than six (6) months prior to the petition or which has not been adjusted within six (6) months from the date of filing of the petition for review and adjustment. The petition shall allege that, in applying the presumptive child support established by this article, the support amount will change by twenty percent (20%) or more per month from the amount of the existing order. The court shall require the parents to complete a verified financial statement on forms approved by the Wyoming supreme court, and shall apply the presumptive child support set out in this article in conducting the review and adjustment. If, upon applying the presumptive child support to the circumstances of the parents or child at the time of the review, the court finds that the support amount would change by twenty percent (20%) or more per month from the amount of the existing order, the court shall consider there to be a change of circumstances sufficient to justify the modification of the support order. The provisions of this section do not preclude a party or assignee from bringing an action for modification of a support order, based upon a substantial change of circumstances, at any time. Every three (3) years, upon the request of either parent or, if there is a current assignment of support rights in effect, upon the request of the department, the court, with respect to a support order being enforced under this article and taking into account the best interests of the child involved, shall review and, if appropriate, adjust the order in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to this article. Any adjustment under the three (3) year cycle shall be made without a requirement for a showing of a change in circumstances. The commencement of aid under the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program, medical benefits under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, supplemental nutrition assistance program and supplemental security income (SSI) shall be considered a substantial change of circumstances requiring modification of child support.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the parties fail to agree that the presumptive child support amount under W.S. 20-2-304 is appropriate, the court may order the party seeking to deviate from the presumptive child support amount to pay a reasonable attorney fee and court costs to the other party unless, after hearing the evidence and considering the factors contained in W.S. 20-2-307(b), the court deviates from the presumptive support amount.</p>
                  <p>(c) In addition to the petition authorized under subsection (a) of this section, the court on its own motion, or the department without petitioning the court, may increase monthly child support payments to include amounts for arrearages or may decrease the monthly child support payment in cases of emergencies or if the arrearages are paid. Any action by the department to increase monthly child support payments under this subsection shall allow the obligor a reasonable opportunity to contest the action in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and rules and regulations adopted by the department.</p>
                  <p>(d) An order for child support is not subject to retroactive modification except:</p>
                  <p>(i) Upon agreement of the parties; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The order may be modified with respect to any period during which a petition for modification is pending, but only from the date notice of that petition was served upon the obligee as provided by the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, if the obligor or the department is the petitioner, or to the obligor, if the obligee or the department is the petitioner.</p>

The department, upon proof by affidavit filed with the clerk of district court or upon verified information it has received pursuant to W.S. 20-6-106 that the child support is subject to an assignment, may redirect the child support to the person or agency in whose favor the assignment is made.</p>

                  <p>(b) The court, upon petition and following notice and hearing, shall no longer require the order for security if the court determines:</p>

                  <p>(a) In any action to establish or modify a child support obligation, the court shall order either or both of the parents to provide medical support, which may include dental, optical or other health care needs for their dependent children. The court shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Require in the support order:</p>
                  <p>(A) That one (1) or both parents shall provide insurance coverage for the children if insurance can be obtained at a reasonable cost and the benefits under the insurance policy are accessible to the children; and</p>
                  <p>(B) That both parents be liable to pay any medical expenses not covered by insurance and any deductible amount on the required insurance coverage as cash medical support; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Specify in the court order the proportion for which each parent will be liable for any medical expenses as cash medical support, which may include dental, optical or other health care expenses incurred by any person or agency on behalf of a child if the expenses are not covered by insurance.</p>
                  <p>(b) When the insurance coverage is ordered pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the court shall order the obligated parent to submit to the court and to the other parent, or to the other parent's representative, written proof that the insurance has been obtained or that application for insurability has been made within sixty (60) days after the entry of the order requiring insurance coverage. Proof of insurance coverage shall contain, at a minimum:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name of the insurer;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The policy number;</p>

                  <p>(vi) Two (2) copies of claim forms.</p>
                  <p>(c) The court shall order the obligated parent to notify the court and the other parent if insurance coverage for any child is denied, revoked, or altered in any way that would affect the other parent including any change relating to information required in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) The court may hold an obligated parent in contempt for refusing to provide the ordered insurance, or for failing or refusing to provide the information required in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) In addition to enforcement by contempt, as provided for in subsection (d) of this section, the obligated parent is liable to the other parent, any person or agency for:</p>
                  <p>(i) Part or all of the cost of medical care and medical insurance premiums paid or provided to a child for any period in which the obligated parent failed to provide required coverage;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any direct insurance benefits received by the obligated parent and not used for the medical care of the child; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in collection that the court may determine appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(f) In any action to establish or modify a child support obligation and upon a sufficient showing by the department of family services that birth costs were paid by medical assistance within the preceding five (5) years, the court shall also order that the father pay birth costs to the department in the manner set forth in W.S. 14-2-1001 through 14-2-1008. Failure of the department to make a sufficient showing under this subsection shall not preclude the department from subsequently seeking recovery in any other manner authorized by law.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the department of family services has previously attempted to recover birth costs pursuant to W.S. 14-2-1001 through 14-2-1008, the court is not required to issue the order described in subsection (f) of this section.</p>

                <p>No other or greater evidence is required to prove the marriage of a husband and wife or that the defendant is the father or mother of a child or children than is required to prove such facts in a civil action. In a prosecution under this act no statute or rule of law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between husband and wife shall apply. Both husband and wife are competent witnesses to testify against each other to any relevant matters including the fact of marriage and the parentage of the child or children but neither shall be compelled to give evidence incriminating himself or herself. Proof of the desertion of the wife, child or children in destitute or necessitous circumstances, or of the neglect or refusal to provide for the support and maintenance of the wife, child or children is prima facie evidence that the desertion, neglect or refusal is willful.</p>

                <p>(a) A party contesting the validity or enforcement of a registered support order or seeking to vacate the registration has the burden of proving one (1) or more of the following defenses:</p>
                <p>(i) The issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party;</p>
                <p>(ii) The order was obtained by fraud;</p>
                <p>(iii) The order has been vacated, suspended or modified by a later order;</p>
                <p>(iv) The issuing tribunal has stayed the order pending appeal;</p>
                <p>(v) There is a defense under the law of this state to the remedy sought;</p>
                <p>(vi) Full or partial payment has been made;</p>
                <p>(vii) The statute of limitations under W.S. 20-4-176 precludes enforcement of some or all of the alleged arrearages; or</p>
                <p>(viii) The alleged controlling order is not the controlling order.</p>
                <p>(b) If a party presents evidence establishing a full or partial defense under subsection (a) of this section, a tribunal may stay enforcement of a registered support order, continue the proceeding to permit production of additional relevant evidence and issue other appropriate orders. An uncontested portion of the registered support order may be enforced by all remedies available under the laws of this state.</p>
                <p>(c) If the contesting party does not establish a defense under subsection (a) of this section to the validity or enforcement of a registered support order, the registering tribunal shall issue an order confirming the order.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>20-4-183. Modification of child support order of another state.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If W.S. 20-4-193 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal of this state may modify a child support order issued in another state which is registered in this state if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds that:</p>
                <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2005, ch. 103, § 3.</p>
                <p>(ii) The following requirements are met:</p>
                <p>(A) Neither the child, the obligee who is an individual nor the obligor resides in the issuing state;</p>
                <p>(B) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and</p>
                <p>(C) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or</p>
                <p>(iii) This state is the state of residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(b) Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.</p>
                <p>(c) A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation for support. If two (2) or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and shall be so recognized under W.S. 20-4-148 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.</p>
                <p>(d) In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.</p>
                <p>(e) On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>(f) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e) of this section and W.S. 20-4-142(b), a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:</p>
                <p>(i) One (1) party resides in another state; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The other party resides outside the United States.</p>

                <p>(i) May enforce its order that was modified only as to arrearages and interest accruing before the modification;</p>
                <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2005, ch. 103, § 3,</p>

                <p>(b) The governor of this state may:</p>
                <p>(i) Demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual found in the other state who is charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee; or</p>
                <p>(ii) On the demand of the governor of another state surrender an individual found in this state who is charged criminally in the other state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee.</p>
                <p>(c) A provision for extradition of individuals not inconsistent with this act applies to the demand even if the individual whose surrender is demanded was not in the demanding state when the crime was allegedly committed and has not fled therefrom.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>20-4-187. Conditions of rendition.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Before making demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least sixty (60) days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this act or that the proceeding would be of no avail.</p>
                <p>(b) If, under this act or a law substantially similar to this act, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a` proceeding.</p>
                <p>(c) If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.</p>

                <p>(b) An order issued by a tribunal of this state modifying a foreign child support order pursuant to this section is the controlling order.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, a tribunal of this state shall recognize and enforce a registered convention support order.</p>
                  <p>(b) The following grounds are the only grounds on which a tribunal of this state may refuse recognition and enforcement of a registered convention support order:</p>
                  <p>(i) Recognition and enforcement of the order is manifestly incompatible with public policy, including the failure of the issuing tribunal to observe minimum standards of due process, which include notice and opportunity to be heard;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction consistent with W.S. 20-4-142;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The order is not enforceable in the issuing country;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The order was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure;</p>
                  <p>(v) A record transmitted in accordance with W.S. 20-4-206 lacks authenticity or integrity;</p>
                  <p>(vi) A proceeding between the same parties and having the same purpose is pending before a tribunal of this state and that proceeding was the first to be filed;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The order is incompatible with a more recent support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose if the more recent support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this act in this state;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Payment, to the extent alleged arrearages have been paid in whole or in part;</p>
                  <p>(ix) In a case in which the respondent neither appeared nor was represented in the proceeding in the issuing foreign country:</p>
                  <p>(A) If the law of that country provides for prior notice of proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard; or</p>
                  <p>(B) If the law of that country does not provide for prior notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the order and an opportunity to be heard in a challenge or appeal on fact or law before a tribunal; or</p>
                  <p>(x) The order was made in violation of W.S. 20-4-211.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a tribunal of this state does not recognize a convention support order under paragraph (b)(ii), (iv) or (ix) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) The tribunal may not dismiss the proceeding without allowing a reasonable time for a party to request the establishment of a new convention support order; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The support enforcement agency shall take all appropriate measures to request a child support order for the obligee if the application for recognition and enforcement was received under W.S. 20-4-204.</p>

                  <p>(b) If there is no previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this act and a child custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303, a child custody determination made under this section remains in effect until an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction under a provision of law in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303. If a child custody proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303, a child custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination, if it so provides and this state becomes the home state of the child.</p>
                  <p>(c) If there is a previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this act, or a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303, any order issued by a court of this state under this section shall specify in the order a period that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303. The order issued in this state remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the period expires.</p>
                  <p>(d) A court of this state which has been asked to make a child custody determination under this section, upon being informed that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of another state having jurisdiction under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303, shall immediately communicate with the other court. A court of this state which is exercising jurisdiction pursuant to W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303, upon being informed that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child custody determination has been made by, a court of another state under a statute similar to this section shall immediately communicate with the court of that state to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 20-5-304, a court of this state may not exercise its jurisdiction under this article if, at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this act, unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state because a court of this state is a more convenient forum under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-307.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 20-5-304, a court of this state, before hearing a child custody proceeding, shall examine the court documents and other information supplied by the parties pursuant to W.S. 20-5-309. If the court determines that a child custody proceeding has been commenced in a court in another state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this act, the court of this state shall stay its proceeding and communicate with the court of the other state. If the court of the state having jurisdiction under the laws of that state in substantial conformity with this act does not determine that the court of this state is a more appropriate forum, the court of this state shall dismiss the proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(c) In a proceeding to modify a child custody determination, a court of this state shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has been commenced in another state. If a proceeding to enforce a child custody determination has been commenced in another state, the court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Stay the proceeding for modification pending the entry of an order of a court of the other state enforcing, staying, denying or dismissing the proceeding for enforcement;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Enjoin the parties from continuing with the proceeding for enforcement; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Proceed with the modification under conditions it considers appropriate.</p>

                  <p>(a) A court of this state which has jurisdiction under this act to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.</p>
                  <p>(b) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:</p>
                  <p>(i) Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The length of time the child has resided outside this state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The distance between the court in this state and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The relative financial circumstances of the parties;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence; and</p>
                  <p>(viii) The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a court of this state determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.</p>
                  <p>(d) A court of this state may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this act if a child custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as otherwise provided in W.S. 20-5-304 or by other law of this state, if a court of this state has jurisdiction under this act because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303 determines that this state is a more appropriate forum under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-307; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a court of this state declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, it may provide an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child custody proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under a provision of law from that state that is in substantial conformity with W.S. 20-5-301 through 20-5-303.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, it shall assess against the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication expenses, attorney fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses and child care during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate. The court may not assess fees, costs or expenses against this state unless authorized by law other than this act.</p>

                  <p>(i) Has participated, as a party or witness or in any other capacity, in any other proceeding concerning the custody of or visitation with the child, and if so, the pleading or affidavit shall identify the court, the case number and the date of the child custody determination, if any;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Knows of any proceeding that could affect the current proceeding, including proceedings for enforcement and proceedings relating to domestic violence, protective orders, termination of parental rights and adoptions, and if so, the pleading or affidavit shall identify the court, the case number and the nature of the proceeding; and</p>

                  <p>(a) A child custody determination issued by a court of another state may be registered in this state, with or without a simultaneous request for enforcement, by sending to the appropriate court in this state:</p>
                  <p>(i) A letter or other document requesting registration;</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon the filing of a petition seeking enforcement of a child custody determination, the petitioner may file a verified application for the issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child if the child is immediately likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this state.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other witness, finds that the child is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this state, it may issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child. The petition shall be heard on the next judicial day after the warrant is executed unless that date is impossible. In the event that the next judicial day after service of the order is impossible, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible. The application for the warrant shall include the statements required by W.S. 20-5-408(b).</p>
                  <p>(c) A warrant to take physical custody of a child shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Recite the facts upon which a conclusion of imminent serious physical harm or removal from the jurisdiction is based;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide for the placement of the child pending final relief.</p>
                  <p>(d) The respondent shall be served with the petition, warrant and order immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.</p>
                  <p>(e) A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds on the basis of the testimony of the petitioner or other witness that a less intrusive remedy is not effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.</p>
                  <p>(f) The court may impose conditions upon placement of a child to ensure the appearance of the child and the child's custodian.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>20-6-111. Driver's license suspension; nonpayment of child support; administrative hearings.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) When an obligor is in arrears in a court ordered child support obligation, the department or court may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Determine whether the obligor has a driver's license, as defined in W.S. 31-7-102(a)(xxv), that is subject to withholding, suspension or restriction; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Obtain a court ordered withholding, suspension or restriction of the license unless the obligor pays the entire arrearage or enters into a payment plan approved by the department.</p>
                  <p>(b) The court, on motion of the department or on its own motion, may direct the department of transportation to withhold, suspend or restrict the license and the department or the court shall send certified copies of the court order to the obligor, at the obligor's last known address, and to the department of transportation instructing that the department of transportation notify the obligor of the license withholding, suspension or restriction in accordance with the licensing procedures, and that the withholding, suspension or restriction shall remain in effect until the department of transportation is notified by the department or the court that the obligor is in compliance with the court order or has entered into a payment plan approved by the department.</p>
                  <p>(c) If at any time an obligor has complied with the terms of the court order, or has entered into a payment plan approved by the department, the court or the department, whichever has caused notice to be initially provided, shall immediately notify the department of transportation that the withholding, suspension or restriction may be lifted and the license may be reinstated if the obligor is otherwise eligible for reinstatement.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing in this section shall prohibit subsequent orders and notices for subsequent arrearages if the obligor is again subject to the provisions of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department shall adopt rules and regulations to ensure notice is provided in an immediate and timely manner to the department of transportation that an obligor is in satisfactory compliance with the court order under this section. Upon receipt of the notice, the department of transportation shall immediately reinstate the license unless the license was suspended or revoked for other reasons. The department of transportation shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations to ensure the license is immediately reinstated upon receipt of the notice.</p>
                  <p>(f) The department may determine that a driver's license suspension may be better achieved through an administrative suspension if the obligor owes more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) in unpaid child support and the obligor has not made a full monthly child support payment either voluntarily or through income withholding for a period of at least ninety (90) consecutive days prior to the determination. The department shall notify the obligor by first class mail or by personal service if notification by first class mail was unsuccessful, that the obligor is in arrears in a child support obligation and that the obligor's driver's license as defined in W.S. 31-7-102(a)(xxv) shall be suspended by the department of transportation sixty (60) days after the date the obligor receives the notice unless the obligor:</p>
                  <p>(i) Pays the entire arrearage owed;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Enters into a payment plan approved by the department; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Is in full compliance with a court ordered payment plan.</p>
                  <p>(g) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 155, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any suspension arising under subsection (f) of this section may be appealed to the district court. The person whose license or driving privilege is affected may file a request for a hearing in the district court in the county where the child support order was issued. The person shall have sixty (60) days from the date of service of the notice of intent to suspend in which to file the request for hearing. A timely request for hearing shall stay imposition of any suspension under subsection</p>
                  <p>(f) of this section. The district court shall immediately set the matter for determination.</p>
                  <p>(j) Before the license or driving privilege of any person is to be withheld, suspended or restricted under this article, the department shall advise the licensee in the notice required under subsection (f) of this section of his right to appeal to district court for any dispute involving:</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 155, § 2.</p>

                  <p>(iv) The amount of current child support owed or arrearage;</p>
                  <p>(v) The identity of the alleged obligor named in the notice of suspension;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The willfulness of any action or inaction of the obligor that contributed to the nonpayment of child support. As used in this paragraph, "willfulness" means without justifiable excuse.</p>

                  <p>(n) The discretion to modify any order of suspension under this section to allow driving privileges is limited as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) A person whose driving privileges have been suspended for nonpayment of child support may be granted limited driving privileges by the district court or the department of transportation for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A person granted limited driving privileges under this subsection by the district court or the department of transportation shall not be granted an extension of such privileges for twelve (12) months after the limited driving privileges expire unless the person has subsequently made full payment on his child support obligation in arrears, or is in full compliance with a payment plan approved by the department or ordered by a court.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed By Laws 2009, Ch. 155, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(o) After the obligor has paid his child support arrearages in full or has entered into a payment plan with the department, the department shall notify the department of transportation immediately and request the department of transportation to return the driver's license of that obligor pursuant to this section.</p>

                <p>(d) In any action or proceeding in which visitation rights have been granted to a grandparent under this section, the court may for good cause upon petition of the person having custody or who is the guardian of the child, revoke or amend the visitation rights granted to the grandparent.</p>

                <p>(a) With notice or reasonable efforts to provide notice to the noncustodial parent, a person may bring an original action against any person having custody of the child to establish reasonable visitation rights to the child if the person bringing the original action has been the primary caregiver for the child for a period of not less than six (6) months within the previous eighteen (18) months. If the court finds, after a hearing, that visitation would be in the best interest of the child and that the rights of the child's parents are not substantially impaired, the court shall grant reasonable visitation rights to the primary caregiver. In any action under this section for which the court appoints a guardian ad litem, the person bringing the original action under this section shall be responsible for all fees and expenses associated with the appointment.</p>
                <p>(b) No action to establish visitation rights under subsection (a) of this section may be brought by a person related to the child by blood or by a person acting as primary caregiver for the child prior to the adoption of the minor child when neither adopting parent is related by blood to the child.</p>
                <p>(c) In any action or proceeding in which visitation rights have been granted to a primary caregiver under this section, the court may for good cause upon petition of the person having custody or who is the guardian of the child, revoke or amend the visitation rights granted to the primary caregiver.</p>
