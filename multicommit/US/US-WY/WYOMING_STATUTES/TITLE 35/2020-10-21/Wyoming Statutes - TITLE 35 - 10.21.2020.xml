                  <p>(a) In exercising its powers and duties under W.S. 35-1-240(a)(xx), the department of health may enter into memoranda of understanding with the several counties separately for the organization, management, delivery and financing of public health nursing and related functions. The county commissioners of each county shall have at least the following choices for organizing public health nursing and related functions:</p>
                  <p>(i) A partnership memorandum of understanding system;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A state administered public health nursing system with a county contribution; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Subject to the limitation stated in subsection</p>
                  <p>(e) of this section, a system under which the state contracts with a county for the provision of all or a portion of the public health nursing and other public health functions.</p>
                  <p>(b) A memorandum of understanding entered into pursuant to this section may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Specify how the state and county employees will be supervised and disciplined;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Specify the hours that public health offices will be open and the holidays that will be observed and may require both state and county employees in the public health functions to conform to a common work schedule, which may be different in different counties;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Specify which resources, including financial and physical resources, will be furnished by the state and which by the county or other local entity;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Contain any other provisions useful in the organization, management or delivery of public health services.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any county entering into a memorandum of understanding with the department to provide public health nursing services under the systems specified in paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) of this section shall be allowed to provide services under a different system specified in paragraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section at any time on or before July 1, 2018. After July 1, 2018, a county shall not be allowed to change the system under which public health nursing services are provided unless the department consents to the change.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the commissioners of a county enter into a memorandum of understanding to provide public health nursing services under the system specified in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, at the request of the commissioners of the county, county employee positions assisting in providing public health functions may be transferred to state at-will employee contract positions under W.S. 9-2-1022(a)(xi)(F) or to permanent state positions, provided that the number of positions transferred under this subsection shall not exceed the largest number of public health nursing positions in the county between July 1 and December 31 of the year prior to the transfer. A transfer under this subsection shall mean payment of monies to the department for the purpose of creating a position under W.S. 35-1-243(a)(ii). Any state employee position created shall comply with the state of Wyoming personnel rules. The department may charge an administrative fee and accept county or other local funds to defray the cost of transferred positions as provided in the memorandum of understanding. The funds shall be deposited by the state treasurer in a separate account. The funds in the account are continuously appropriated to the department of health and shall be paid out upon request of the department as provided by law. Positions transferred under this subsection into state permanent positions shall be paid benefits in the same manner and at the same rates as for comparable state employees pursuant to the state of Wyoming compensation policy. The department's authorization for employee positions shall be expanded by operation of law to accommodate all positions transferred to the state under this subsection and shall continue so long as the county that requested the transfers satisfies its obligations under its memorandum of understanding with the department. Upon a county's failure to make all payments required by its memorandum of understanding with the department or upon the county's request, the department shall no longer have any state positions transferred by the county under this subsection and, upon written notice to the transferred employees and the county, shall follow the state of Wyoming personnel rules regarding reductions in force. All positions created under this subsection shall be included within the department's standard or supplemental budget request.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any entity providing public health nursing services under paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) of this section and which maintains a city, county or district board of health under W.S. 35-1-301 through 35-1-309 may enter into a contract with the department to perform public health nursing services under paragraph (a)(iii) of this section pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. This subsection and any contract made pursuant to it shall be operable only for the period for which the department is specifically authorized by law to transfer funds between expenditure series for the purpose of making payments to those entities that operate public health nursing services pursuant to this subsection. The department's authorization for employee positions shall be reduced automatically to correspond with any transfer of funds from a salary expenditure series to a contract series. All contracts made pursuant to this subsection shall be conditioned upon the availability of appropriate funding and the authority to transfer funds as provided in this subsection. A contract made pursuant to this subsection shall provide, with as much specificity as is reasonable and practical given the time available, the services to be performed, the resources and other assistance to be provided by the state and the outcomes expected.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the commissioners of two (2) or more counties desire to form a joint powers board to manage all or part of the public health functions in the respective counties, the relevant memoranda of understanding may be modified accordingly and may provide for transition to a joint powers board upon its creation pursuant to the Wyoming Joint Powers Act.</p>
                  <p>(g) The county commissioners of each county may choose for all or a portion of their county to use, for the delivery and management of public health nursing and related functions, any existing organization which currently delivers any or all public health services.</p>

                  <p>(b) The funeral director or person acting as such who first assumes custody of a dead body shall file the death certificate.

In that event the local registrar shall inform the local health officer and refer the case to him for immediate investigation and certification of cause of death prior to issuing a permit for burial, cremation or other disposition of the body. If the circumstances of the case suggest that the death was caused by other than natural causes, the local registrar shall refer the case to the coroner for investigation and certification. The coroner shall examine the body and consider the history of the case, and obtain the assistance and advice of a competent physician who will assist the coroner in determining the cause of death by examination of the body, autopsy, inquest or other procedure determined necessary.

                  <p>(a) Any physician who is licensed and practicing in the state may apply to the department for a loan to be used to pay the cost of the physician's participation in a risk retention group, of which the majority of ownership interest is held by Wyoming physicians, providing medical malpractice insurance coverage. Upon approval of the application for a loan, the physician shall enter into a contract with the state, wherein the physician shall agree:</p>
                  <p>(i) To practice in the area of medical specialty or subspecialty for the entire period of time for which the loan under this section remains unpaid;</p>
                  <p>(ii) To provide medical care, for the entire period of time the loan under this section remains unpaid, to Wyoming residents qualified under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act or the Child Health Insurance Program established under W.S. 35-25-101 who are seeking medical care which the physician is qualified to provide;</p>
                  <p>(iii) To submit documentation to establish that the physician has complied with the terms of the contract and to determine the amount of the loan that should be provided under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iv) To provide the state with a security interest in the physician's membership or shareholder interest in the risk retention group;</p>
                  <p>(v) To repay any loans made under this section within ten (10) years from the date of disbursement of loan proceeds, together with interest as determined by the state treasurer at an annual rate equal to the average prime interest rate during the preceding fiscal year plus one percent (1%). To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) To immediately repay all funds distributed to the physician pursuant to this section, together with attorney fees and costs incurred in collection, for any contract period in which the physician is in breach of the contract.</p>
                  <p>(b) At the times specified in the contract but in no event less than once per year, the physician shall submit documentation to the department showing compliance with the terms of the contract. The amount of loan to be made shall be the amount applied for but not to exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the physician's most recent annual malpractice insurance premium. The amount shall also be prorated for the percentage of the physician's actual practice in Wyoming. The department may approve the making of the loan upon its determination of compliance with this section. Loan proceeds shall not be disbursed until the physician has paid or immediately will pay for his participation in the risk retention group.</p>
                  <p>(c) If funding available from the account is insufficient to pay assistance for all physicians who apply for assistance under this article, the department may at its discretion reduce the payments to pay each eligible physician a pro rata amount.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any physician who fails or refuses to fulfill the terms of the contract required under subsection (a) of this section shall be in breach of the contract.</p>
                  <p>(e) No loan shall be made under this section unless the physician has completed and submitted an application to the department on or before March 30, 2007.</p>

                  <p>(a) Until June 30, 2012, funds within the challenge account shall be expended as provided in this subsection. Funds within a separate account which are obligated for commitments made prior to July 1, 2012 shall remain in the separate account to fulfill the obligation in accordance with this subsection until June 30, 2013. From and after July 1, 2012 funds in the challenge account shall be expended as provided in subsection</p>
                  <p>(k) of this section. To the extent funds are available in the separate account of any critical access or rural hospital within the endowment challenge account, the state treasurer shall match endowment gifts actually received by that critical access or rural hospital's foundation. A match shall be paid under this subsection by the state treasurer at the time any accumulated amounts actually received by a critical access or rural hospital foundation total ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more. The match shall be made by transferring from the separate challenge account to the appropriate critical access or rural hospital board of trustees an amount equal to the amount accumulated by the foundation or, if the critical access or rural hospital was eligible to receive revenues from any tax imposed under W.S. 35-2-414(b) and (c) and a tax was not levied or was levied pursuant to one (1) but not both of those subsections, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount accumulated by the foundation. The board shall immediately transfer all matching funds received to its foundation. The critical access or rural hospital foundation shall match the funds received under this subsection with an equal amount of foundation funds to be managed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each critical access hospital shall enter into an agreement with its foundation under which the foundation shall manage the matching funds received under subsection (a) of this section in the same manner as other permanent endowment funds are managed by its foundation, including the permanent investment of funds, maintenance of the fund corpus as inviolate and the expenditure of fund earnings for endowment purposes only.</p>
                  <p>(c) Earnings from endowment funds established with matching funds under this section shall be expended only for the purpose of the endowment, including increasing the balance in the fund corpus and reasonable costs of administration.</p>
                  <p>(d) The state treasurer shall make transfers to the appropriate critical access hospital board under this section not later than the end of the calendar quarter following the quarter during which foundation gifts total at least ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). If gifts are made through a series of payments or transfers, no matching funds shall be transferred under this section until the total value of all payments or transfers actually received totals at least ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(e) Matching funds paid under this section shall not be distributed to or encumbered by any critical access or rural hospital foundation in excess of the amount in the challenge account for that critical access or rural hospital. Matching funds shall not be transferred to any critical access or rural hospital board by the state treasurer or from any such board to a foundation except to match gifts actually received by the foundation.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the foundation's board of any critical access or rural hospital determines that the purpose of an endowment gift to the critical access or rural hospital is not consistent with the mission or capability of that critical access or rural hospital, the gift shall not qualify for matching funds under this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) For the purpose of computing the matching amount, the state treasurer shall use the value of an endowment gift based upon its fair market value at the time the gift is received by the critical access or rural hospital foundation. The critical access or rural hospital shall provide evidence of fair market value for any gift if requested by the state treasurer and shall fund the cost of providing any requested evidence.</p>
                  <p>(h) Each critical access or rural hospital shall on or before October 1 of each year submit a report to the state treasurer from its foundation on the endowment matching program under this section for the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include a financial summary and a review of the accomplishments resulting from endowment program expenditures. The report required under this subsection shall be for each applicable fiscal year through June 30, 2015.</p>
                  <p>(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, for any critical access or rural hospital qualifying under the provisions of W.S. 35-1-1002(a)(ii)(B), funds provided under this article shall be disbursed only to the board of county commissioners in which the hospital is located. The board of county commissioners shall provide those funds to the critical access or rural hospital under contract between the board of county commissioners and the critical access or rural hospital, which contract shall incorporate all provisions of this article and which shall control the distribution and use of those funds.</p>
                  <p>(k) From and after July 1, 2012, to the extent a critical access or rural hospital has not received matching funds under this article totaling at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), and to the extent funds segregated under W.S. 35-1-1003(b) are available in the challenge account, the state treasurer shall match endowment gifts actually received by that critical access or rural hospital’s foundation. A match shall be paid under this subsection by the state treasurer at the time any accumulated amounts actually received by a critical access or rural hospital foundation total ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more. The match shall be made by transferring from the challenge account to the appropriate critical access or rural hospital board of trustees an amount equal to the amount accumulated by the foundation or, if the critical access or rural hospital was eligible to receive revenues from any tax imposed under W.S. 35-2-414(b) and a tax was not levied pursuant to that subsection, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount accumulated by the foundation. The board shall immediately transfer all matching funds received to its foundation. The critical access or rural hospital foundation shall match the funds received under this subsection with an equal amount of foundation funds to be managed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-2-414. Administration of finances; assessment and levy of tax.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The board of trustees of special hospital districts shall administer the finances of such districts according to the provisions of the Uniform Municipal Fiscal Procedures Act. The assessor shall at the time of making the annual assessment of his district also assess the property of each special hospital district in his county and return to the county assessor at the time of returning the assessment schedules, separate schedules listing the property of each such district assessed by him. Said separate schedules shall be compiled by the county assessor, footed and returned to the board of county commissioners as provided for other assessment schedules.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board of county commissioners, at the time of making the levy for county purposes shall levy a tax for that year upon the taxable property in such district in its county for its proportionate share based on assessed valuation of the estimated amount of funds needed by each such district, but in no case shall the tax for such district exceed in any one (1) year the amount of three (3) mills for operation on each dollar of assessed valuation of such property except as provided by subsection (c) of this section. There shall be no limit on the assessment for the payment of principal and interest on bonds approved by the board of county commissioners and approved by the electors of the district as provided in W.S. 35-2-415. The taxes and assessments of all special hospital districts shall be collected by the county collector at the same time and in the same manner as state and county taxes are collected, provided, however, said assessment and tax levied under the provisions of this act shall not be construed as being a part of the general county mill levy.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, if the board of trustees votes to increase the mill levy beyond three (3) mills as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, the board of county commissioners shall call an election within the district upon the question of whether the mill levy should be increased beyond three (3) mills. The election shall be called, conducted and canvassed as provided for bond elections by the Political Subdivision Bond Election Law, W.S. 22-21-101 through 22-21-112, on the first date authorized under W.S. 22-21-103 which is not less than sixty (60) days after the trustees vote to increase the mill levy beyond three (3) mills. In no event shall the tax in a district exceed in any one (1) year the amount of six (6) mills for operation and maintenance on each dollar of assessed valuation of property. The increase in mill levy is effective only if the question is approved by a majority of those voting thereon within the hospital district. The cost of any special election under this subsection shall be borne by the board of trustees.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the proposition to authorize a mill levy is approved, the same proposition or a proposition to impose a mill levy in a different amount, not to exceed three (3) mills, shall be submitted to the voters, until defeated, at the second general election following the election at which the proposition was initially approved and at the general election held every four (4) years thereafter. If the proposition to impose or continue the tax is defeated, the proposition shall not again be submitted to the electors for at least twenty-three (23) months.</p>

                  <p>(b) Whenever a petition, signed by twenty-five percent (25%) of the registered electors residing within the area to be annexed in the county which is not part of an established hospital district in the county, is presented to the board of county commissioners of the county, the county commissioners shall within five (5) days request the board of trustees of the established hospital district either to approve or reject the petition.</p>
                  <p>(c) The board of trustees of the hospital district shall act upon the request within thirty (30) days.

The board of trustees of the hospital district shall be qualified electors of the entire district so expanded. The election shall be called for a date determined by the board of county commissioners and shall be held in the manner provided by law for the first election of trustees of the original district. Trustees of the original district shall remain in office until the trustees of the expanded district are elected and qualified.</p>

                  <p>(a) The trustees of a hospital district established pursuant to W.S. 35-2-401, are hereby authorized to issue revenue bonds, notes and warrants or other revenue securities, hereinafter referred to as securities, for the purpose of acquiring, erecting, constructing, reconstructing, improving, remodeling, furnishing and equipping hospitals and related facilities including any facilities for senior health care as defined under W.S. 35-2-1201(b), and acquiring a site or sites therefor, from time to time hereafter as the trustees may determine.</p>
                  <p>(b) If there are no monies available to the trustees of a hospital district before receipt of property taxes the trustees may issue warrants in anticipation of the receipt of property taxes for payment of operational expenses. The aggregate amount of the warrants shall not exceed the total amount of taxes levied. The warrants shall be payable solely from the collected taxes.</p>
                  <p>(c) The trustees of a hospital district may obtain financing for its operations by entering into agreements for lines of credit with any financial institution as defined in W.S. 13-1-101(a)(ix). The line of credit may either be unsecured, or secured by a pledge of revenues anticipated to be received during the current fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>(d) In addition to its authority to issue warrants under this section, the trustees of a hospital district may issue tax and revenue anticipation notes in amounts not to exceed eighty percent (80%) of the total amount of taxes levied for operation of the district for the fiscal year during which the notes are issued when the board determines that insufficient funds are available to meet the obligations of the hospital during any fiscal year. A hospital district shall not enter into agreements or issue instruments of the type allowed by this section for any fiscal year until all debts financed by such agreements or instruments for any prior fiscal year have been paid in full. Tax and revenue anticipation notes issued under this subsection are subject to the procedural requirements of W.S. 9-4-1103 through 9-4-1105 for state tax and revenue anticipation notes, except:</p>
                  <p>(i) The authority of the state treasurer referenced in W.S. 9-4-1103 through 9-4-1105 shall be exercised by the board issuing the notes; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Notwithstanding W.S. 9-4-1105(a), investments of the proceeds of the notes by the board are limited to those investments authorized under W.S. 9-4-831.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Notify each resident or patient and each resident or patient's guardian or conservator, if any, or other responsible party, if known, of the receivership;</p>

                  <p>(iii) Remedy violations of federal and state laws and regulations governing the operation of the health care facility;</p>

No such bonds shall be issued or be valid unless they shall be so registered and have endorsed thereon a certificate of the examiner showing that such bonds are issued pursuant to law, the data filed in the office of the director being the basis of such certificate.</p>

The state health officer shall, subject to W.S. 35-4-112 and if in his judgment the occasion requires, direct the county health officer to declare the infected place to be in quarantine. The county health officer shall place any restrictions upon ingress and egress at this location as in his judgment or in the judgment of the state health officer are necessary to prevent the spread of the disease from the infected locality. The county health officer shall upon declaring any city, town or other place to be in quarantine, control the population of the city, town or other place as in his judgment best protects the people and at the same time prevents the spread of the disease. If necessary for the protection of the public health and subject to W.S. 35-4-112, the state health officer shall establish and maintain a state quarantine and shall enforce practical regulations regarding railroads or other lines of travel into and out of the state of Wyoming as necessary for the protection of the public health.

                  <p>(a) Pursuant to department of health rules and regulations, the state health officer or his designee shall publish a list of communicable diseases or conditions to be reported by licensed physicians and laboratories in the state. It shall be the duty of every practicing or licensed physician or other health care provider as provided by department rules and regulations in the state of Wyoming to report immediately to the state health officer or his designee in the manner established by department rule and regulation through published reporting procedures provided to each licensed physician or laboratory. The state health officer or his designee shall collect and provide information which may include the name of the person suffering from disease only to the county health officer or health representatives where disease control efforts are required. For purposes of this section, "health representatives" means those health care workers assigned by federal, state or local health authorities to assist with disease control and investigation efforts under the direct supervision of the state health officer or his designee and local county health officer.

Notwithstanding other provisions of state law, the review of records may occur without patient consent, but shall be kept confidential and shall be restricted to information necessary for the control, investigation and prevention of disease conditions dangerous to the public health. Any person who receives medical information under this subsection shall not disclose that information for any other purpose other than for purposes of the investigation and disease control efforts. Any violation of this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or both.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person who has been quarantined pursuant to this act may appeal to the district court at any time for release from the quarantine. The court may hold a hearing on the appeal after notice is provided to the state health officer at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the hearing. After the hearing, if the court finds that the quarantine is not reasonably necessary to protect the public health, it shall order the person released from quarantine. The burden of proof for the need for the quarantine shall be on the state health officer, except that in the case of bona fide scientific or medical uncertainty the court shall give deference to the professional judgment of the state health officer unless the person quarantined proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the quarantine is not reasonably necessary to protect the public health.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any person quarantined shall have the right to communicate by telephone or any other available electronic means, but the state health officer may, in order to protect the public health, deny the quarantined person's right to meet in person with any person not subject to the quarantine, except that a parent or legal guardian may upon request be quarantined with the minor patient.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event of a public health emergency of unknown effect, the state health officer may impose a temporary quarantine until there is sufficient information to determine what actions, if any, are reasonably needed to protect the public health.</p>

                  <p>(b) During a public health emergency, the state health officer may subject a person to vaccination or medical treatment without consent in the following circumstances:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the parent, legal guardian or other adult person authorized to consent to medical treatment of a minor child cannot be located and consulted and the vaccination of or medical treatment for the minor child is reasonably needed to protect the public health or protect the minor child from disease, death, disability or suffering;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the person authorized to consent on behalf of an incompetent person cannot be located and consulted and the vaccination of or medical treatment for the incompetent person is reasonably needed to protect the public health or protect the incompetent person from disease, death, disability or suffering.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a person withholds or refuses consent for himself, a minor or other incompetent when the vaccination or medical treatment is reasonably needed to protect the health of others from a disease carrying the risk of death or disability, then the person for whom the vaccination or medical treatment is refused may be quarantined by the state health officer.</p>

                  <p>(a) During a public health emergency as defined by W.S. 35-4-115(a)(i), any health care provider or other person, including a business entity, who in good faith follows the instructions of a state, city, town or county health officer or who acts in good faith in responding to the public health emergency is immune from any liability arising from complying with those instructions or acting in good faith. This immunity shall apply to health care providers who are retired, who have an inactive license or who are licensed in another state without a valid Wyoming license and while performing as a volunteer during a declared public health emergency as defined by W.S. 35-4-115(a)(i). This immunity shall not apply to acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.</p>
                  <p>(b) The licensing boards for any health care provider holding a permit or license as a health care provider regulated under title 33 of the Wyoming statutes shall provide by rule and regulations for the temporary licensure of health care providers during a public health emergency as declared by the governor pursuant to W.S. 35-4-115(a)(i). If necessary during a declared public health emergency, the state health officer may issue temporary practice licenses to health care providers who are retired, who have an inactive license or who are licensed in another state without a valid Wyoming license pending action on an application for issuance of a temporary license by the appropriate licensing board pursuant to this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) All temporary health care provider licenses issued by the state health officer under subsection (b) of this section shall terminate automatically upon declaration by the governor, pursuant to W.S. 35-4-115(a)(i), that the public health emergency has ended.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon receipt of a report or notice of a case or a reasonably suspected case of sexually transmitted disease infection, a health officer within his respective jurisdiction:</p>
                  <p>(i) May isolate the individual in accordance with existing standards of medical practice;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If examination has not been performed, may provide for the examination of the infected individual or the individual reasonably suspected of suffering from a sexually transmitted disease and shall report the examination results to the individual;</p>
                  <p>(iii) May require the infected individual to seek adequate treatment or, subject to subsection (d) of this section, may require the individual to submit to treatment at public expense; and</p>

                  <p>(b) To the extent possible, the health officer shall identify any other person with whom the infected individual has had contact which may have resulted in significant exposure of that person to a dangerous or life-threatening sexually transmitted disease. For purposes of this subsection, "significant exposure" means:</p>
                  <p>(i) Contact of an emergency medical services provider's broken skin or mucous membrane with the infected individual's blood or bodily fluids other than tears or perspiration;</p>
                  <p>(ii) That a needle stick, or scalpel or other instrument wound has occurred in the process of caring for the infected individual;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Sexual contact;</p>

                  <p>(c) To the extent possible, a health officer shall make every reasonable effort to notify any person identified in subsection (b) of this section of his possible exposure to a sexually transmitted disease. Such notification shall include the name of the sexually transmitted disease to which the person may have been exposed, the approximate date of possible exposure, and shall advise the person of the nature of the disease and sources for education and counseling as to the medical significance of the disease.

                  <p>(f) Upon receipt of information documenting an actual exposure of a health care worker as provided in paragraphs (b)(i) and (ii) of this section to blood or body fluids of a patient where the exposure could lead to a communicable disease infection which is capable of transmission by blood or other body fluids, a health care provider acting within his scope of practice may order appropriate testing to be performed on a specimen from the patient by a duly licensed and accredited laboratory. If the patient's specimen is not available for testing, a health care provider acting within his scope of practice, or county health officer may, with the patient's consent, order the necessary testing according to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Wyoming department of health. If the patient does not consent to testing, the county health officer or the authority responsible for the care of the patient may apply to the district court for an order to have the necessary testing performed. Test results will be kept confidential and will be reported by the health care provider in accordance with W.S. 35-4-130 through 35-4-134. Reports to the department of health shall be made on an official state disease case report form or the report may be made by telephone with confirmation by the written form. For purposes of this section, "health care worker" means all personnel involved in the care of a patient, including first responders, such as law enforcement officers, rescue personnel and those acting as good samaritans.</p>

                  <p>(b) A donor's revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under W.S. 35-5-206 is not a refusal and does not bar another person specified in W.S. 35-5-204 or 35-5-209 from making an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under W.S. 35-5-205 or 35-5-210.</p>

                  <p>(d) A revocation of an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part under W.S. 35-5-206 by a person other than the donor does not bar another person from making an anatomical gift of the body or part under W.S. 35-5-205 or 35-5-210.</p>

                  <p>(f) In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under W.S. 35-5-204, an anatomical gift of a part for one (1) or more of the purposes set forth in W.S. 35-5-204 is not a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of the part for any of the other purposes by the donor or any other person under W.S. 35-5-205 or 35-5-210.</p>
                  <p>(g) If a donor who is an unemancipated minor dies, a parent of the donor who is reasonably available may revoke or amend an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part.</p>

                  <p>(i) For purposes of research or education, a hospital, accredited medical school, dental school, college or university, organ procurement organization or any appropriate person;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, an individual designated by the person making the anatomical gift if the individual is the recipient of the part;</p>

                  <p>(c) If an anatomical gift of one (1) or more specific parts or of all parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in subsection (a) of this section but identifies the purpose for which an anatomical gift may be used, the following rules apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) If the part is an eye and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate eye bank;</p>

                  <p>(iii) If the part is an organ and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If the part is an organ, an eye or tissue and the gift is for the purpose of research or education, the gift passes to the appropriate procurement organization.</p>

If the gift cannot be used for transplantation or therapy, the gift may be used for research or education.</p>
                  <p>(e) If an anatomical gift of one (1) or more specific parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in subsection (a) of this section and does not identify the purpose of the gift, the gift may be used only for transplantation or therapy, and the gift passes in accordance with subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) If a document of gift specifies only a general intent to make an anatomical gift by words such as "donor," "organ donor," or "body donor," or by a symbol or statement of similar import, the gift may be used only for transplantation or therapy, and the gift passes in accordance with subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) For purposes of subsections (b), (e) and (f) of this section, the following rules apply:</p>

                  <p>(h) An anatomical gift of an organ for transplantation or therapy, other than an anatomical gift under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, passes to the organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ.</p>
                  <p>(j) If an anatomical gift does not pass pursuant to subsections (a) through (h) of this section or the decedent's body or part is not used for transplantation, therapy, research or education, custody of the body or part passes to the person under obligation to dispose of the body or part.</p>
                  <p>(k) A person may not accept an anatomical gift if the person knows that the gift was not effectively made under W.S. 35-5-205 or 35-5-210 or if the person knows that the decedent made a refusal under W.S. 35-5-207 that was not revoked. For purposes of this subsection, if a person knows that an anatomical gift was made on a document of gift, the person is deemed to know of any amendment or revocation of the gift or any refusal to make an anatomical gift on the same document of gift.</p>
                  <p>(m) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, nothing in this act affects the allocation of organs for transplantation or therapy.</p>

                  <p>(a) When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the department and any donor registry that it knows exists for the geographical area in which the individual resides to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift.</p>
                  <p>(b) A procurement organization shall be allowed reasonable access to information in the records of the department to ascertain whether an individual at or near death is a donor.</p>
                  <p>(c) When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability of a part that is or could be the subject of an anatomical gift for transplantation, therapy, research or education from a donor or a prospective donor. During the examination period, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part may not be withdrawn unless the hospital or procurement organization knows that the individual expressed a contrary intent.</p>
                  <p>(d) Unless prohibited by law other than this act, at any time after a donor's death, the person to whom a part passes under W.S. 35-5-211 may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.</p>
                  <p>(e) Unless prohibited by law other than this act, an examination under subsection (c) or (d) of this section may include an examination of all medical and dental records of the donor or prospective donor.</p>
                  <p>(f) Upon the death of a minor who was a donor or had signed a refusal, unless a procurement organization knows the minor is emancipated, the procurement organization shall conduct a reasonable search for the parents of the minor and provide the parents with an opportunity to revoke or amend the anatomical gift or revoke the refusal.</p>
                  <p>(g) Upon referral by a hospital under subsection (a) of this section, a procurement organization shall make a reasonable search for any person listed in W.S. 35-5-209 having priority to make an anatomical gift on behalf of a prospective donor. If a procurement organization receives information that an anatomical gift to any other person was made, amended or revoked, it shall promptly advise the other person of all relevant information.</p>
                  <p>(h) Subject to W.S. 35-5-211(j) and 35-5-223, the rights of the person to whom a part passes under W.S. 35-5-211 are superior to the rights of all others with respect to the part. The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part. Subject to the terms of the document of gift and this act, a person who accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial or cremation, and use of remains in a funeral service. If the gift is of a part, the person to whom the part passes under W.S. 35-5-211, upon the death of the donor and before embalming, burial or cremation, shall cause the part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation.</p>
                  <p>(j) Neither the physician who attends the decedent at death nor the physician who determines the time of the decedent's death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part from the decedent.</p>
                  <p>(k) A physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of a donor that the physician or technician is qualified to remove.</p>

                  <p>(a) The department shall electronically transfer to a procurement organization the information that appears on the front of the driver's license or identification card, to include the name, gender, date of birth, social security number if it appears on the license or card, driver's license or identification card number, issue date or renewal date and address of the individual identified as a donor. The department shall also electronically transfer any subsequent change in the donor's status, including revocation of the gift. The department shall submit to the department of health a statement of costs incurred to initially install and establish the electronic transfer of donor information. The department of health shall direct the state auditor to reimburse the department for the costs from the anatomical awareness account under W.S. 35-5-225 to the extent there are funds in that account. There shall be no charge to a procurement organization for the transfer of donor information.</p>
                  <p>(b) With the information obtained from the department and from other sources including donors and donors' agents pursuant to W.S. 35-5-205(b), the procurement organization shall establish and maintain a statewide organ and tissue donor registry to facilitate organ and tissue donations. The cost incurred to create and maintain the registry shall be paid by the procurement organization. Registry information shall be accessible to any procurement organization located in Wyoming and may be disseminated to a procurement organization in another state for the recovery or placement of organs and tissue. Registry information may also be disseminated to Wyoming eye banks under this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) A donor registry shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Allow a donor or other person authorized under W.S. 35-5-204 to include on the donor registry a statement or symbol that the donor has made, amended or revoked an anatomical gift;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be accessible to a procurement organization to allow it to obtain relevant information on the donor registry to determine, at or near death of the donor or a prospective donor, whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended or revoked an anatomical gift; and</p>

                  <p>(i) "Advance health-care directive" means a power of attorney for health care or a record signed or authorized by a prospective donor containing the prospective donor's direction concerning a health-care decision for the prospective donor;</p>

                  <p>(iii) "Health-care decision" means any decision regarding the health care of the prospective donor.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a prospective donor has a declaration or advance health-care directive and the terms of the declaration or directive and the express or implied terms of a potential anatomical gift are in conflict with regard to the administration of measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of a part for transplantation or therapy, the prospective donor's attending physician and prospective donor shall confer to resolve the conflict. If the prospective donor is incapable of resolving the conflict, an agent acting under the prospective donor's declaration or directive, or, if none or the agent is not reasonably available, another person authorized by law other than this act to make health-care decisions on behalf of the prospective donor, shall act for the donor to resolve the conflict. The conflict shall be resolved as expeditiously as possible. Information relevant to the resolution of the conflict may be obtained from the appropriate procurement organization and any other person authorized to make an anatomical gift for the prospective donor under W.S. 35-5-209. Before resolution of the conflict, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part may not be withheld or withdrawn from the prospective donor if withholding or withdrawing the measures is not contraindicated by appropriate end-of-life care.</p>

                  <p>(a) A coroner shall cooperate with procurement organizations to maximize the opportunity to recover anatomical gifts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research or education.</p>
                  <p>(b) If a coroner receives notice from a procurement organization that an anatomical gift might be available or was made with respect to a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner and a post-mortem examination is going to be performed, unless the coroner denies recovery in accordance with W.S. 35-5-222, the coroner or designee shall conduct a post-mortem examination of the body or the part in a manner and within a period compatible with its preservation for the purposes of the gift.</p>
                  <p>(c) A part may not be removed from the body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of a coroner for transplantation, therapy, research or education unless the part is the subject of an anatomical gift. The body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner may not be delivered to a person for research or education unless the body is the subject of an anatomical gift. This subsection does not preclude a coroner from performing the medicolegal investigation upon the body or parts of a decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon request of a procurement organization, a coroner shall release to the procurement organization the name, contact information and available medical and social history of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner. If the decedent's body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research or education, the coroner shall release post-mortem examination results to the procurement organization. The procurement organization may make a subsequent disclosure of the post-mortem examination results or other information received from the coroner only if relevant to transplantation or therapy.</p>
                  <p>(b) The coroner may conduct a medicolegal examination by reviewing all medical records, laboratory test results, x-rays, other diagnostic results and other information that any person possesses about a donor or prospective donor whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner which the coroner determines may be relevant to the investigation.</p>
                  <p>(c) A person who has any information requested by a coroner pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall provide that information as expeditiously as possible to allow the coroner to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a period compatible with the preservation of parts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research or education.</p>
                  <p>(d) If an anatomical gift has been or might be made of a part of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner and a post-mortem examination is not required, or the coroner determines that a post-mortem examination is required but that the recovery of the part that is the subject of an anatomical gift will not interfere with the examination, the coroner and procurement organization shall cooperate in the timely removal of the part from the decedent for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research or education.</p>
                  <p>(e) If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner has been or might be made, but the coroner initially believes that the recovery of the part could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the decedent's cause or manner of death, the coroner shall consult with the procurement organization or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization about the proposed recovery. After consultation, the coroner may deny the recovery.</p>
                  <p>(f) The coroner and procurement organization shall enter into an agreement establishing protocols and procedures governing relations between them when the coroner believes that the recovery of a part for anatomical gift from a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the decedent's cause or manner of death or the documentation or preservation of evidence. Decisions regarding the recovery of a part from the decedent shall be made in accordance with the agreement.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the coroner or designee denies recovery under subsection (f) of this section, the coroner or designee shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Explain in a record the specific reasons for not allowing recovery of the part;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Include the specific reasons in the records of the coroner; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide a record with the specific reasons to the procurement organization.</p>
                  <p>(h) If the coroner or designee allows recovery of a part under subsection (d), (e) or (f) of this section, the procurement organization, upon request, shall cause the physician or technician who removes the part to provide the coroner with a record describing the condition of the part, a biopsy, a photograph and any other information and observations that would assist in the post-mortem examination.</p>
                  <p>(j) If a coroner or designee is required to be present at a removal procedure under subsection (f) of this section, upon request the procurement organization requesting the recovery of the part shall reimburse the coroner or designee for the additional costs incurred in complying with subsection (f) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the director has probable cause to believe that any food, drug, device, cosmetic or consumer commodity is adulterated or so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent, within the meaning of this act, he shall affix a tag or other appropriate marking to the article giving notice that the article is or is suspected of being adulterated or misbranded and has been embargoed. The director shall release all other articles.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the director finds an article embargoed under subsection (a) of this section to be adulterated or misbranded, the director may immediately petition the district court for the county in which the article is embargoed to condemn the article, otherwise the tag or other marking shall be removed by the director or his agent.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the court finds that an embargoed article is adulterated or misbranded, the article, after entry of the decree, shall be destroyed at the owner's expense, under the supervision of the director or his agent. All court costs and fees, transportation costs, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be taxed against the owner of the article or his agent unless the adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the article. If so, the court, after entry of the decree and after costs, fees and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond, conditioned that the article shall be correctly labeled or processed, has been executed, may by order direct delivery of the article to the owner for labeling or processing under the supervision of the director. The expense of supervision shall be paid by the owner. The article shall be returned to the owner and the bond shall be discharged on the representation to the court by the director that the article is no longer in violation of this act and that the expenses of supervision have been paid. Nothing in this section prevents the director from authorizing the owner of an adulterated or misbranded article from destroying it as the director prescribes.</p>

                  <p>(a) All labels of consumer commodities, as defined by this act, shall conform with the requirements for the declaration of net quantity of contents of section 4 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. § 1451, et seq.) and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto as of the effective date of this act. Consumer commodities exempted from the requirements of section 4 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act are also exempt from this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) The label of any package of a consumer commodity which bears a representation as to the number of servings of the commodity contained in the package shall bear a statement of the net quantity (in terms of weight, measure or numerical count) of each serving.</p>
                  <p>(c) No person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged consumer commodity if any qualifying words or phrases appear in conjunction with the separate statement of the net quantity of contents required by subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section, but nothing in this section prohibits supplemental statements, at other places on the package, describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents. Supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the commodity contained in the package.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the director determines that regulations containing prohibitions or requirements other than those prescribed by subsection (a) of this section are necessary to prevent the deception of consumer or to facilitate value comparisons as to any consumer commodity, the director shall promulgate rules and regulations with respect to that commodity in conjunction with W.S. 35-7-127.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department shall promulgate rules with respect to labeling. Every retailer and every wholesaler who sells or offers for sale in this state through an establishment or otherwise any:</p>
                  <p>(i) Meat that is the product of any country foreign to the United States, shall clearly label the meat as "imported," naming the country of its origin;</p>

                  <p>(B) "Retailer" means a person regularly engaged in the business of selling meat at retail to the public, and selling only to the user or consumer and not for resale;</p>
                  <p>(C) "Wholesaler" means a person regularly engaged in the business of selling meat at wholesale to retailers for subsequent sale at retail to the public.</p>
                  <p>(f) Subsections (a) and (c) of this section shall not apply to the preparation, service, use, consumption or storage of foods at a traditional event or activity pursuant to W.S. 35-7-1703. The definitions in W.S. 35-7-1702 shall apply to this subsection.</p>

                  <p>The legislature hereby finds that pesticides and devices are valuable to our state's agricultural production and to the protection of man and the environment from insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be pests, and it is essential to the public health and welfare that they be regulated closely to prevent adverse effects on human life and the environment. The purpose of this act is to regulate, in the public interest, the labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, use and application of pesticides to control pests. New pesticides are continually being discovered or synthesized which are valuable for the control of pests, and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, and related purposes. The dissemination of accurate scientific information as to the proper use or nonuse, of any pesticide, is vital to the public health and welfare and the environment both immediate and future. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for registration of pesticides and devices.</p>

                  <p>The director of the department of agriculture shall administer and enforce the provisions of this act and regulations issued thereunder. The board of certification may issue regulations after a public hearing following due notice to all interested persons in conformance with the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act to carry out the provisions of this act. Regulations may prescribe methods to be used in the application of pesticides, may prescribe standards for the classification and certification of applicators of pesticides, and may require certification, licensing, payment of reasonable fees for licensing or certification, submission of information, and passing of examinations by applicators of pesticides. Where the board of certification finds that regulations are necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this act, the regulations may relate to the time, place, manner, methods, materials, and amounts and concentrations, in connection with the application of the pesticide, and may restrict or prohibit use of pesticides in designated areas during specified periods of time and shall encompass all reasonable factors which the board deems necessary. The department may issue licenses. Notwithstanding the provisions of W.S. 35-7-354(e), the board of agriculture, by regulation, following a hearing and pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, may declare a specific pesticide or pesticide use a "restricted use pesticide", but only following a recommendation of the board of certification, and a finding of fact, in a public hearing conducted by the board of certification, that unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, including man, pollinating insects, animals, crops, wildlife and lands, other than pests, may reasonably occur. The director of the department of agriculture may allow the registration, licensing, testing, inspection and reporting requirements of this article to be conducted electronically as provided by the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act, W.S. 40-21-101 through 40-21-119 and any applicable federal electronic requirements.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-7-356. Registration.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Every pesticide or device which is distributed within this state or delivered for transportation or transported in intrastate commerce or between points within this state through any point outside this state shall be registered with the department of agriculture by its manufacturer or formulator subject to the provisions of this act. The registration shall be renewed annually prior to December 31 of each year but not if a pesticide or device is shipped from one plant or warehouse to another plant or warehouse as a constituent part to make a pesticide or device which is registered under the provisions of this act, if the pesticide or device is not sold and if the container thereof is plainly and conspicuously marked "For Experimental Use Only", together with the manufacturer's name and address, or if a written permit has been obtained from the department to sell the specific pesticide or device for experimental purposes subject to restrictions and conditions set forth in the permit.</p>
                  <p>(b) The applicant for registration shall file a statement with the department which shall include:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and address of the applicant and the name and address of the person whose name will appear on the label, if other than the applicant's;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The name of the pesticide or device;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Other necessary information required for completion of the department's application for registration form;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The use classification as provided in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act when required by regulations under this act.</p>
                  <p>(c) The director may require a full description of the tests made and the results thereof upon which the claims are based on any pesticide or device on which restrictions are being considered. In the case of renewal of registration, a statement shall be required only with respect to information which is different from that furnished when the pesticide or device was registered or last registered. The director may prescribe other necessary information by regulation.</p>
                  <p>(d) Every registrant of a pesticide or device shall pay an annual registration fee of one hundred forty dollars ($140.00) for each product registered. All registrations shall expire on December 31 of each year, following the date of the registration, and may thereupon be renewed for successive periods of twelve (12) months upon payment of the proper fee. One hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) of the fee collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the special natural resource account in the department of agriculture which is hereby created. Funds in the special natural resource account are continuously appropriated to the department and shall only be used to provide funding for the pesticide registration fee program. Fifteen dollars ($15.00) of the fee collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the pesticide education account in the department of agriculture which is hereby created. Funds in the pesticide education account are continuously appropriated to the department and shall only be used to provide funding for the pesticide applicator certification program provided by the University of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any registration approved by the director and in effect on December 31 for which a renewal application has been made and the proper fee paid, shall continue in full force and effect until such time as the director notifies the applicant that the registration has been renewed, or otherwise denied in accord with the provisions of W.S. 35-7-358.

If it appears from such examination that a pesticide or device fails to comply with the provisions of this act or regulations adopted thereunder, and the director contemplates instituting criminal proceedings against any person, the director shall cause appropriate notice to be given to such person. Any person so notified shall be given an opportunity within a reasonable time to present his views, either orally or in writing, with regard to the contemplated proceedings. If thereafter in the opinion of the director, it appears that the provisions of the act or regulations adopted thereunder have been violated by such person, the director shall refer a copy of the results of the analysis or the examination of such pesticide or device to the district attorney for the county in which the violation occurred.</p>

The court shall with probable cause upon such application issue the search warrant for the purposes requested.</p>
                  <p>(e) The director may bring an action to enjoin the violation or threatened violation of any provision of this act or any rule made pursuant to this act in the district court of the county in which such violation occurs or is about to occur.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-7-1011. Control of substances.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The commissioner shall administer this act and with the advice of the advisory board established in W.S. 35-7-1005 may add substances to or delete or reschedule all substances enumerated in the schedules in W.S. 35-7-1014, 35-7-1016, 35-7-1018, 35-7-1020 and 35-7-1022 pursuant to the procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. In making a determination regarding a substance, the commissioner shall consider the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The actual or relative potential for abuse;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The history and current pattern of abuse;</p>
                  <p>(v) The scope, duration, and significance of abuse;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The risk to the public health;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The potential of the substance to produce psychic or physiological dependence liability;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this article; and</p>
                  <p>(ix) Its other uses, both medical and commercial.</p>
                  <p>(b) After considering factors enumerated in subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner shall make findings with respect thereto and issue a rule controlling the substance if he finds the substance has a potential for abuse.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the commissioner designates a substance as an immediate precursor, substances which are precursors of the controlled precursor shall not be subject to control solely because they are precursors of the controlled precursor.</p>
                  <p>(d) If any substance is designated, rescheduled, or deleted as a controlled substance under federal law the commissioner shall control the substance under this act in the same manner as federal law within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the change but not later than thirty (30) days after the first publication of the change in the Federal Register. Under this subsection, the commissioner shall control the substance in the same manner as federal law through the promulgation of an emergency rule, followed by promulgation of a permanent rule under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. If the commissioner objects to the designation, rescheduling or deletion of a substance, the commissioner shall within the same period required to control the substance publish the reasons for objection and afford all interested parties an opportunity to be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, the commissioner shall publish his decision which shall be final unless altered by statute. Upon publication of an objection to designation, rescheduling or deletion under this act by the commissioner, control under this act is stayed until the commissioner publishes his final decision. Any final decision that ultimately controls the substance under this act in the same manner as federal law shall be finalized through the promulgation of an emergency rule, followed by promulgation of a permanent rule under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(e) Authority to control under this section does not extend to distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, or tobacco.</p>
                  <p>(f) The commissioner shall exclude any nonnarcotic substance from a schedule if such substance may under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., and W.S. 33-24-131 of the Wyoming Pharmacy Act, be lawfully sold over the counter without a prescription.</p>

                  <p>(a) Every person who manufactures, distributes or dispenses any controlled substance within this state or who proposes to engage in the manufacture, distribution or dispensing of any controlled substance within this state, must obtain every two (2) years, on or before July 1, a registration issued by the board in accordance with its rules. Any registrant who fails to renew his registration by July 1 of each renewal year shall be charged a late fee. If the failure to renew continues past September 30 of the renewal year, the registration shall be cancelled and the United States drug enforcement administration notified for cancellation of the registrant's federal registration.</p>
                  <p>(b) Persons registered by the board under this act to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or conduct research with controlled substances may possess, manufacture, distribute, dispense, or conduct research with those substances to the extent authorized by their registration and in conformity with the other provisions of this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) The following persons need not register and may lawfully possess controlled substances under this act:</p>
                  <p>(i) An agent or employee of any registered manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser of any controlled substance if he is acting in the usual course of his legitimate business or employment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A common or contract carrier or warehouseman, or an employee thereof, whose possession of any controlled substance is in the usual course of business or employment;</p>

                  <p>(a) The board shall register an applicant to manufacture or distribute controlled substances included in W.S. 35-7-1014, 35-7-1016, 35-7-1018, 35-7-1020 and 35-7-1022 unless it determines that the issuance of that registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining the public interest, the board shall consider the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) Maintenance of effective controls against diversion of controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific, or industrial channels;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Compliance with applicable state and local law;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any convictions of the applicant under any federal and state laws relating to any controlled substance;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Past experience in the manufacture or distribution of controlled substances, and the existence in the applicant's establishment of effective controls against diversion;</p>
                  <p>(v) Furnishing by the applicant of false or fraudulent material in any application filed under this act;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Suspension or revocation of the applicant's federal registration to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances as authorized by federal law; and</p>
                  <p>(vii) Any other factors relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.</p>
                  <p>(b) Registration under subsection (a) of this section does not entitle a registrant to manufacture and distribute controlled substances in Schedule I or II other than those specified in the registration.</p>
                  <p>(c) Practitioners shall be registered to dispense any controlled substances or to conduct research with controlled substances in Schedules II through V if they are authorized to dispense or conduct research under the law of this state. The board need not require separate registration under this article for practitioners engaging in research with nonnarcotic controlled substances in Schedules II through V where the registrant is already registered under this article in another capacity. Practitioners registered under federal law to conduct research with Schedule I substances may conduct research with Schedule I substances within this state upon furnishing the board evidence of that federal registration. The board shall enroll any practitioner registered under this subsection in the controlled substance prescription tracking program maintained by the board under W.S. 35-7-1060 if the practitioner is authorized to dispense any controlled substances in Schedules II through V. The board may promulgate rules and regulations for purposes of enrolling those practitioners in the tracking program.</p>
                  <p>(d) Compliance by manufacturers and distributors with the provisions of the federal law respecting registration (excluding fees) entitles them to be registered under this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) A registration under W.S. 35-7-1025 to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance may be suspended or revoked by the board upon a finding that the registrant:</p>
                  <p>(i) Has furnished false or fraudulent material information in any application filed under this act;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude under any state or federal law relating to any controlled substance;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Has had his federal registration suspended or revoked to manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled substances;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Has willfully violated any of the provisions of this act, or any rules and regulations relating to controlled substances;</p>
                  <p>(v) Has failed to provide adequate security for the storage of controlled substances to the extent that repeated diversions have occurred; or</p>
                  <p>(vi) Has voluntarily surrendered his license to practice, or has had his license revoked or suspended, or the renewal thereof has been denied or lapsed for cause by his professional licensing board.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board may limit revocation or suspension of a registration to the particular controlled substance with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the board suspends or revokes a registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at the time of suspension or the effective date of the revocation order may be placed under seal. No disposition may be made of substances under seal until the time for taking an appeal has elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded unless a court, upon application therefor, orders the sale of perishable substances and the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with the court. Upon a revocation order becoming final, all controlled substances may be forfeited to the state.</p>
                  <p>(d) The board shall promptly notify the bureau of all orders suspending or revoking registration and all forfeitures of controlled substances.</p>
                  <p>(e) In the case of a revocation or suspension sought by the board's staff under paragraph (a)(ii), (iii) or (vi) of this section, a copy of an order or other appropriate documents from a court or administrative agency, certified by the clerk, judge, secretary or executive director thereof, evidencing a revocation, suspension, voluntary suspension or conviction of a felony, shall be conclusive evidence of the conviction, revocation or suspension of the federal registration, or the loss of the license to practice.</p>
                  <p>(f) The board, by regulation, may adopt procedures under which the denial, suspension, revocation or denial of renewal of a registration may be resolved by mutual agreement between the registrant or applicant and the board's staff, subject to prior approval by the board.</p>

                  <p>(a) Before denying, suspending, or revoking a registration, or refusing a renewal of registration, the board shall serve upon the applicant or registrant an order to show cause why registration should not be denied, revoked or suspended, or why the renewal should not be refused. The order to show cause shall contain a statement of the basis therefor and shall call upon the applicant or registrant to appear before the board at a time and place not less than thirty (30) days after the date of service of the order, but in the case of a denial or renewal of registration the show cause order shall be served not later than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the registration. These proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act without regard to any criminal prosecution or other proceeding. Proceedings to refuse renewal of registration shall not abate the existing registration which shall remain in effect pending the outcome of the administrative hearing.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board may suspend, without an order to show cause, any registration simultaneously with the institution of proceedings under W.S. 35-7-1026, or where renewal of registration is refused, if it finds there is imminent danger to the public health or safety which warrants this action. The suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of the proceedings, including judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the board or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                  <p>Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this act or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of possession of a controlled substance under W.S. 35-7-1031(c) or 35-7-1033(a)(iii)(B), or pleads guilty to or is found guilty of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance under W.S. 35-7-1039, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon terms and conditions. Any term of probation imposed under this section for a felony offense shall not exceed the maximum term of probation authorized under W.S. 7-13-302(b). Upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime, including the additional penalties imposed for second or subsequent convictions under W.S. 35-7-1038. There may be only one (1) discharge and dismissal under this section with respect to any person. This section shall not be construed to provide an exclusive procedure.

                  <p>(b) Any special agent designated by the attorney general and any law enforcement officer engaged in the enforcement of this act may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Carry firearms in the performance of his official duties;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Serve search warrants, arrest warrants, administrative inspection warrants, subpoenas, and summonses issued under the authority of this state;</p>

                  <p>and</p>

                  <p>(c) All prosecutions originating under this act shall be the duty and obligation of the district attorney for the county in which the offense occurred.</p>
                  <p>(d) A search warrant relating to offenses involving controlled substances may be served at any time of the day or night if the judge or district court commissioner issuing the warrant is satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that grounds exist for the warrant and for its service at such time.</p>

Any officer acting under such warrant, shall, as soon as practicable after entering the premises, identify himself and give the reason and authority for his entrance upon the premises.</p>

                  <p>(a) Issuance and execution of administrative inspection warrants for controlled premises as defined in this section shall be as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any district court judge or district court commissioner upon proper oath or affirmation showing probable cause, may issue warrants for the purpose of conducting administrative inspections authorized by this act or rules hereunder, and seizures of property appropriate to such inspections. For purposes of the issuance of administrative inspection warrants, probable cause exists upon showing a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this act, as it relates to the regulation of the legitimate traffic in controlled substances, sufficient to justify administrative inspection of the area, premises, building or conveyance in the circumstances specified in the application for the warrant;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A warrant shall issue only upon an affidavit of a designated officer or employee of the board or of the commissioner having knowledge of the facts alleged, sworn to before the district judge or district court commissioner establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. If the district judge or district court commissioner is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe they exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the area, premises, building, or conveyance to be inspected, the purpose of the inspection, and, if appropriate, the type of property to be inspected, if any. The warrant shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) State the grounds for its issuance and the name of each person whose affidavit has been taken in support thereof;</p>
                  <p>(B) Be directed to a person authorized by W.S. 35-7-1045 to execute it;</p>
                  <p>(C) Command the person to whom it is directed to inspect the area, premises, building, or conveyance identified for the purpose specified and, if appropriate, direct the seizure of the property specified;</p>
                  <p>(D) Identify the item or types of property to be seized, if any;</p>
                  <p>(E) Direct that it be served during normal business hours and designate the judge to whom it shall be returned.</p>
                  <p>(iii) A warrant issued pursuant to this section must be executed and returned within ten (10) days of its date unless, upon a showing of a need for additional time, the court orders otherwise. If property is seized pursuant to a warrant, a copy shall be given to the person from whom or from whose premises the property is taken, together with a receipt for the property taken. The return of the warrant shall be made promptly, accompanied by a written inventory of any property taken. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the person executing the warrant and of the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, if present or in the presence of at least one (1) credible person other than the person executing the warrant. A copy of the inventory shall be delivered to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken and to the applicant for the warrant;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The judge or district court commissioner who has issued a warrant shall attach thereto a copy of the return and all papers returnable in connection therewith and file them with the clerk of the district court for the judicial district in which the inspection was made.</p>
                  <p>(b) The board may make administrative inspections of controlled premises in accordance with the following provisions:</p>
                  <p>(i) For purposes of this section only, "controlled premises" means:</p>
                  <p>(A) Places where persons registered or exempted from registration requirements under this act are required to keep records; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Places including factories, warehouses, establishments, and conveyances in which persons registered or exempted from registration requirements under this act other than an ultimate user are permitted to hold, manufacture, compound, process, sell, deliver, or otherwise dispose of any controlled substance.</p>
                  <p>(ii) When authorized by an administrative inspection warrant issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section an officer or employee designated by the board or commissioner, upon presenting the warrant and appropriate credentials to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, may enter controlled premises for the purpose of conducting an administrative inspection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) When authorized by an administrative inspection warrant, an officer or employee designated by the board or commissioner may:</p>
                  <p>(A) Inspect and copy records required by this act to be kept;</p>
                  <p>(B) Inspect, within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, controlled premises and all pertinent equipment, finished and unfinished material, containers, and labeling found therein, and except as provided in paragraph (b)(v) of this section, all other things therein, including records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities bearing on violation of this act; and</p>
                  <p>(C) Inventory any stock of any controlled substance therein and obtain samples thereof.</p>
                  <p>(iv) This section does not prevent the inspection without a warrant of books and records pursuant to an administrative subpoena issued in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, nor does it prevent entries and administrative inspections, including seizures of property, without a warrant:</p>
                  <p>(A) If the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the controlled premises consents;</p>
                  <p>(B) In situations presenting imminent danger to health or safety where a warrant is not constitutionally required;</p>
                  <p>(C) In situations involving inspection of conveyances if there is reasonable cause to believe that the mobility of the conveyance makes it impracticable to obtain a warrant;</p>
                  <p>(D) In any other exceptional or emergency circumstance where time or opportunity to apply for a warrant is lacking and a warrant is not constitutionally required; or</p>
                  <p>(E) In all other situations in which a warrant is not constitutionally required.</p>
                  <p>(v) An inspection authorized by this section shall not extend to financial data, sales data, other than shipment data, or pricing data, unless the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the controlled premises consents in writing.</p>

                  <p>(D) A forfeiture of a conveyance encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if he neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act.</p>
                  <p>(vi) All "drug paraphernalia" as defined by W.S. 35-7-1002(a)(xxvii);</p>
                  <p>(vii) All buildings knowingly used or intended for use to store, manufacture or distribute property described under paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subsection if the owner has knowledge of or gives consent to the act of violation. A forfeiture of property encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if he did not have knowledge of or give consent to the act;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Any property or other thing of pecuniary value furnished in exchange for a controlled substance in violation of this act including any proceeds, assets or other property of any kind traceable to the exchange and any money, securities or other negotiable instruments used to facilitate a violation of this act. Property used or furnished without the consent or knowledge of the owner is not forfeitable under this section to the extent of his interest.</p>
                  <p>(b) Property subject to forfeiture under this act may be seized by any law enforcement officer of the state upon process issued by any district court or district court commissioner having jurisdiction over the property. Seizure without process may be made if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search under a search warrant or an inspection under an administrative inspection warrant;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state in a criminal, injunction or forfeiture proceeding based upon this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The board or commissioner has probable cause to believe that the property was used or is intended to be used in violation of this act. Prior to property being seized by any law enforcement officer of the state pursuant to this paragraph, the following procedures shall be followed:</p>
                  <p>(A) The law enforcement officer shall communicate with the commissioner regarding the facts and circumstances involving the property to be seized. Based upon the information provided, the commissioner shall determine whether probable cause exists that the property identified by the law enforcement officer was used or was intended to be used in a violation of this act;</p>
                  <p>(B) If the commissioner determines there is probable cause to seize the property, he shall direct the officer to seize the property. At the time of the seizure, the person or persons from whom the property was seized shall be given written notice that the seized property is subject to forfeiture. The notice shall include an advisement that:</p>
                  <p>(I) The person has the right to attend the hearing required by subsection (c) of this section, but shall not have the right to present evidence or cross examine any witness;</p>
                  <p>(II) The person will be given at least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time, date and location of the hearing; and</p>
                  <p>(III) The purpose of the hearing is for a court to determine whether there was probable cause to believe that the property was used or was intended to be used in violation of this act.</p>
                  <p>(C) If the commissioner determines there is no probable cause to seize the identified property, he shall not authorize the seizure of any property based upon that event or occurrence and the officer shall not seize any property.</p>
                  <p>(c) Within thirty (30) days of the seizure, a probable cause hearing shall be held in circuit court, in the county where the property was seized to determine whether probable cause existed to seize the property pursuant to paragraph (b)(iii) of this section. One (1) or more of the law enforcement officers who made the seizure shall testify under oath regarding the facts and circumstances which established probable cause to seize the property. The hearing shall be recorded by sound, sound-and-visual or stenographic means. If the court determines, based upon the evidence presented, that at the time of the seizure:</p>
                  <p>(i) Probable cause did not exist to seize the property, the court shall order the property to be immediately returned to its lawful owner or one (1) of the persons from whom it was seized; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Probable cause existed to seize the property, the court shall order that the commissioner may file an action for the forfeiture of the property.</p>
                  <p>(d) In the event of seizure pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, no action for the forfeiture of property pursuant to this section shall be instituted unless it is brought within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of seizure or within thirty (30) days following the completion of any criminal prosecution relating to the seizure, whichever is later. All forfeiture proceedings or actions shall be brought by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>(e) Property taken or detained under this section shall not be subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of the commissioner subject only to the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the proceedings. When property is seized under this act, the commissioner shall place the property under seal or otherwise assure the property is maintained under conditions reasonably necessary to preserve the property's value or may sell the property and hold the proceeds thereof if the property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value until the forfeiture proceedings have become final as to all parties and all rights of appeal have been exhausted. In order to preserve the property, if cash, the commissioner may deposit funds into a demand deposit account at an institution located within the state of Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(f) Before a forfeiture action may be filed and no later than thirty (30) days from the date of entry of an order finding probable cause pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner shall serve a notice of seizure and intended forfeiture upon any third party, ascertained after reasonably diligent inquiry, known to have an interest in the property. The notice shall describe the date and location of the seizure, the property seized and the statutory basis for the forfeiture. The notice shall be served in accordance with the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure except that service by publication shall not be required. The notice requirements of this subsection shall not apply to the party or parties from whom the property was directly seized.</p>
                  <p>(g) A court shall not issue any forfeiture order unless the notice under subsection (f) of this section has been accomplished to the satisfaction of the court.</p>
                  <p>(h) After the commissioner is authorized by the court or by this section to file a forfeiture action, the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure shall govern the action unless in conflict with subsections (j) through (n) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(j) The complaint to seek forfeiture of property under this section shall describe with reasonable particularity:</p>
                  <p>(i) The approximate value of the property;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The facts giving rise to the seizure or custody;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The name and position of the person making the seizure or taking the property into custody;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The name and address of the owners of the property or those persons who were in possession of the property at the time of the seizure; and</p>
                  <p>(v) The manner in which all parties reasonably known to have an interest in the property seized were served in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) In the action for the forfeiture of property, the burden of proof shall be on the commissioner to establish by clear and convincing evidence the extent to which, if any, the property is subject to forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>(m) Subsequent to the commissioner carrying his burden of proof pursuant to subsection (k) of this section, an interest in property belonging to a third party shall not be forfeited to the extent the third party establishes he has a perfected lien in the property, proves by a preponderance of evidence that he has a perfected priority interest in the property or that he is an innocent owner. For purposes of this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(i) With respect to a property interest in existence at the time the violation of this act took place, "innocent owner" means a person who held an interest in the property and neither had knowledge of nor consented to the violation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) With respect to a property interest acquired after the violation of this act has taken place, "innocent owner" means a person who, at the time that person acquired the interest in the property:</p>
                  <p>(A) Was a bona fide purchaser or seller for value of goods or services or a holder of a bona fide security interest; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Did not know and was reasonably without cause to believe the property was subject to forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>(n) The right to trial by jury applies to forfeiture proceedings under this section.</p>
                  <p>(o) A person's interest in property is not subject to forfeiture to the extent that the forfeiture is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture. The commissioner shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that a forfeiture is not grossly disproportionate. Proportionality shall be decided by the court as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) In determining whether a forfeiture is grossly disproportionate, the court shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(A) The extent to which the property was used or intended to be used in executing the underlying offense;</p>
                  <p>(B) The value of the property, including both its fair market and subjective value;</p>
                  <p>(C) The actions of the person involved in the activity giving rise to the forfeiture proceedings;</p>
                  <p>(D) The severity of the criminal sanctions associated with the actions of the person;</p>
                  <p>(E) Whether the property constitutes the person's lawful livelihood or means of earning a living;</p>
                  <p>(F) Whether the offense or attempted offense has severe collateral consequences; and</p>
                  <p>(G) Any other factors the court deems necessary and relevant.</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the court finds the forfeiture is grossly disproportionate to the offense, it shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture as it finds appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(p) In any forfeiture proceeding under this section, the court shall award a prevailing property owner reasonable:</p>
                  <p>(i) Attorney fees and costs; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Damages.</p>
                  <p>(q) The proceedings and judgment of forfeiture shall be in rem and shall be against the property itself.</p>
                  <p>(r) When property is forfeited under this act, the commissioner may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Retain it for official use; in which case it shall become the property of the state of Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Sell any such property which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public. The proceeds shall be used for payment of all proper expenses of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, maintenance of custody, advertising and court costs;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Require the board to take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Repealed by Laws 1983, ch. 160, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(v) Transfer ownership and control of the property to any municipality or political subdivision of the state for its official use; or</p>
                  <p>(vi) Authorize any law enforcement officer to apply to the district court with jurisdiction for an order providing for destruction of the contraband controlled substances or paraphernalia if no longer necessary for evidentiary purposes, provided, however, that a district court order shall not be necessary for the division of criminal investigation to destroy quantities of contraband controlled substances after the division has tested random samples. The division of criminal investigation shall adopt rules necessary to operate a program to destroy bulk quantities of contraband controlled substances, which shall include:</p>
                  <p>(A) The photographing and videotaping of the entire bulk amount of seized contraband controlled substances to maintain its evidentiary value and to create exhibits for use in legal proceedings;</p>
                  <p>(B) The extraction of ten (10) random samples from the entire bulk amount of seized contraband controlled substances for laboratory analysis;</p>
                  <p>(C) A weighing on properly calibrated scales of both the bulk amount of seized contraband controlled substances and the representative samples;</p>
                  <p>(D) The additional retention of:</p>
                  <p>(I) Five (5) ounces of organic material if the controlled substance is marihuana or a substance of similar organic composition;</p>
                  <p>(II) Five (5) grams of a controlled substance in powdered or crystalline form;</p>
                  <p>(III) Five-tenths (0.5) of a gram of a controlled substance in liquid form;</p>
                  <p>(IV) An amount sufficient for testing by experts shall be made available from the additionally retained sample for the purpose of defending criminal charges arising from the possession, use or sale of the controlled substance.</p>
                  <p>(E) After the testing and retention of samples specified in this paragraph, the commissioner or his designee may order the destruction of the bulk amount of the seized contraband controlled substance in excess of the representative sample and the additional retained samples of the seized contraband controlled substance;</p>
                  <p>(F) Once the representative samples and the additional retained samples of the contraband controlled substance are no longer necessary for evidentiary purposes, any law enforcement officer, upon authorization from the commissioner, may apply to the district court with jurisdiction for an order providing for the destruction of the remaining contraband controlled substance.</p>
                  <p>(s) Any controlled substance listed in Schedules I through V that is possessed, transferred, sold or offered for sale in violation of this act is contraband and shall be seized and summarily forfeited to the state. Any controlled substance listed in Schedules I through V which is seized or comes into possession of the state and the owner is unknown, is contraband and shall be summarily forfeited to the state.</p>
                  <p>(t) Species of plants from which controlled substances in Schedules I and II may be derived which have been planted or cultivated in violation of this act, or of which the owners or cultivators are unknown, or which are wild growths, may be seized and summarily forfeited to the state.</p>
                  <p>(u) The failure, upon demand by the commissioner, or his authorized agent, of the person in occupancy or in control of land or premises upon which the species of plants are growing or being stored, to produce an appropriate registration, or proof that he is the holder thereof, constitutes authority for the seizure and forfeiture of the plants.</p>
                  <p>(w) Any law enforcement agency of this state may accept, receive, dispose of and expend the property or proceeds from any property forfeited to the federal government or any state and allocated to the agency by the United States attorney general pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881(e) or any law of another state. The property or proceeds shall be in addition to funds appropriated to the law enforcement agency by the state legislature or any unit of local government. The property or proceeds may be credited to any lawfully created fund or account designated to receive proceeds of forfeitures.</p>
                  <p>(y) Any law enforcement agency of this state which receives property or proceeds pursuant to subsection (w) of this section shall report to the attorney general on forms to be prescribed by the attorney general:</p>
                  <p>(i) The receipt of property or proceeds within thirty (30) days from the receipt; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The disposition or expenditure of any property or proceeds within ninety (90) days from the disposition or expenditure.</p>
                  <p>(z) The attorney general shall submit an annual report to the joint appropriations interim committee and the joint judiciary interim committee not later than August 1 concerning recipients and the amount of property and proceeds accepted, received, disposed of or expended during the prior calendar year under this section by law enforcement agencies, other than property subject to summary forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>(aa) No law enforcement agency of this state shall accept property or proceeds pursuant to subsection (w) of this section if the tender of the property or proceeds is conditioned upon the state law enforcement agency's adoption of federal law enforcement practices and procedure.</p>
                  <p>(bb) A law enforcement officer may not request, require or in any manner induce any person to execute a document purporting to waive, for purpose of forfeiture under this section, the person's interest in or rights to property seized, and provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any document obtained by a law enforcement officer purporting to waive a person's interest in or right to property seized under this section is null and void; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Nothing in this subsection prohibits the commissioner, after a hearing and a finding of probable cause as required by subsection (c) of this section, from requesting a person to waive the person's interest in or rights to property.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-7-1060. Controlled substance prescription tracking program.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) In addition to other duties and responsibilities as provided by this act, the board shall maintain a computerized program to track prescriptions for controlled substances for the purposes of assisting patients, practitioners and pharmacists to avoid inappropriate use of controlled substances and of assisting with the identification of illegal activity related to the dispensing of controlled substances. The tracking program and any data created thereby shall be administered by the board, and the board may charge reasonable fees to help defray the costs of operating the program. Any fee shall be included with and in addition to other registration fees established by the board as authorized in W.S. 35-7-1023. The board shall promulgate rules to administer the tracking program under this section. Rules adopted under this subsection may specify requirements and procedures for practitioners, pharmacists and any other person authorized or required to use the tracking program.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, when a practitioner, other than a veterinarian, prescribes a schedule II, III, IV or V controlled substance, the practitioner or his delegate shall search the prescription tracking program for prior prescriptions issued to the patient before first issuing the prescription and as needed thereafter based on current best practice guidelines for the practitioner's licensed profession, except for prescribed opioids for which the practitioner or his delegate shall repeat the search every three (3) months thereafter for as long as the prescribed opioids remain a part of the patient's treatment. A practitioner who prescribes a schedule V controlled substance shall only be required to search the program as otherwise provided in this subsection if the substance is an opioid. A dispenser, other than a veterinarian, shall electronically file with the board information regarding any prescription for a schedule II, III, IV or V controlled substance dispensed by the dispenser no later than the close of business on the business day immediately following the day the controlled substance was dispensed. The board may grant a reasonable time extension to a dispenser or practitioner who is unable to electronically file or search information as required under this subsection. The board may require the filing of other prescriptions and may specify the manner in which the prescriptions are filed. The board may, by rule and regulation, provide exemptions from the requirements of this subsection including but not limited to exemptions for prescriptions dispensed in certain inpatient health care settings, for settings where the risk for diversion or misuse of medication is found by the board to be minimal and exemptions for emergencies and other situations as determined by the board in consultation with other professional licensing boards that license practitioners who are affected by the requirements of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(c) The tracking program shall not be used to infringe on the legal use of a controlled substance. Information obtained through the controlled substance prescription tracking program is confidential and may not be released and is not admissible in any judicial or administrative proceeding, except as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The board may release information to practitioners and practitioner appointed delegates and to pharmacists and pharmacist appointed delegates when the release of the information may be of assistance in preventing or avoiding inappropriate use of controlled substances. The board shall release information to practitioners and practitioner appointed delegates and to pharmacists and pharmacist appointed delegates when the release of the information is necessary to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The board shall report any information that it reasonably suspects may relate to fraudulent or illegal activity to the appropriate law enforcement agency and the relevant occupational licensing board;</p>

                  <p>The proceeds arising from the sale of lots in any cemetery by any person, firm, corporation or municipality, and all other income and revenue thereof, shall be exclusively applied, appropriated or used in improving, preserving and embellishing such cemetery, and its appurtenances, and to paying the necessary operating expenses thereof, and shall not be applied or appropriated to any purpose of profit to the person, firm, corporation or municipality owning or maintaining same; provided, that any mutual cemetery corporation or municipality may use such income and revenue for purchasing or acquiring additional adjacent grounds for cemetery purposes only; provided, however, any cemetery organized by any individual, group of individuals, corporation or association, except municipal corporations and duly organized cemetery districts shall establish a perpetual care fund in an amount equal to at least ninety cents ($.90) for each square foot of cemetery lot sold after the effective date of this act. In support of, and for the protection of such perpetual care fund, there shall be established a trust fund in such amount and under such terms and conditions, including bonded protection of a permanent and enduring nature, as the insurance commissioner of the state of Wyoming may prescribe to carry out the objectives and contractual commitments and trust of such individual, corporation or association.

                  <p>Such fund shall be operated as a perpetual trust according to requirements approved by the insurance department, and shall be used for the benefit of the grave sales and cemetery lots for which deposits shall have been made. The insurance commissioner shall specify securities approved for the investment of the funds which shall include investment of funds with a duly licensed Wyoming bank, trust company, or federal building and loan association, and may require an audit of all of the books and accounts of the cemetery as the need may arise. The cemetery organization shall file a copy of a purchase contract or installment contract for lot or lots, if any there be, with the insurance commissioner when said contract is entered into and shall forthwith notify the insurance commissioner of the final payment or default, if any be made, of such contract or contracts. Any and all funds received and invested as stipulated in this act, and the income therefrom, shall be as a trust and shall not be liable to attachment, garnishment, or other processes, nor shall be seized, taken or appropriated or applied by any legal or equitable processes or operation of law to pay any debt or liability of the person, partnership, association, company or corporation organizing or thereafter operating such cemetery.</p>

Prior to declaring such abandonment, notice shall be served by registered mail at the last known address of such owner, heirs, or assigns. In the event that the address cannot be ascertained, notice shall be given by one (1) publication in the official newspaper of the municipality or special cemetery district in which the cemetery is located. Said notice shall allow thirty (30) days for the owner, heirs, or assigns to advise the city or town or special cemetery district of his identity and address; and if he does so, the city or town or special cemetery district shall not declare the abandonment.</p>
                  <p>Upon the failure of the owner, heirs, or assigns to so communicate with the city or town, it may by resolution declare such lots or parcels abandoned. Thereafter, it may resell such lots or parcels, but shall place in trust an amount of money equivalent to the original selling price of such lots or parcels for payment to the owner, heirs, or assigns. Said trust fund shall be placed in legal investments, and the interest received therefrom shall annually be deposited to the city's or town's general fund or the general fund of the special cemetery district. Money received from the resale of such lots and parcels and deposited in said trust fund may be withdrawn by the cities or towns or the special cemetery district and placed in their general fund if not claimed by the owner, heirs, or assigns within twenty-five (25) years after being so deposited. So long as such lots or parcels remain unsold, the owners, heirs, or assigns may reclaim them by identifying themselves and establishing their right to such lots or parcels.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state fire marshal shall delegate complete authority to municipalities and counties which apply to enforce and interpret local or state fire, building, existing building standards or electrical safety standards which meet the requirements of this section. The state fire marshal shall notify the governing body of the municipality or county of the minimum standards and requirements of this act and W.S. 16-6-501 and 16-6-502 and transfer jurisdiction and authority by letter. Except as provided in W.S. 35-9-119(a)(i) and subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this section affects the authority of the state fire marshal or chief electrical inspector regarding state owned or leased buildings. Local enforcement authority under this subsection shall be subject to the following requirements and certification of inspectors:</p>
                  <p>(i) Before a municipality or county without local enforcement authority is initially granted local enforcement authority for fire, building, existing building standards or electrical standards the state fire marshal shall determine that the local governing body has adopted minimum standards by ordinance or resolution that are equivalent to or more stringent than those applicable standards adopted by the department;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a municipality or county that has been granted local enforcement authority under this subsection fails to adopt, within six (6) months following the adoption of new standards by the department, or maintain standards by ordinance or resolution that at least meet the statewide standards, enforcement authority shall immediately revert to the department. It shall be the responsibility of the municipality or county to notify the department of the repeal of minimum standards in their jurisdiction;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If code enforcement authority for fire and building codes is requested, certification of a fire inspector or building inspector by the International Code Council or the International Conference of Building Officials is required for any inspector employed or contracted after July 1, 2010 to enforce those codes for the municipality or county;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If code enforcement authority for the electrical code is requested, certification of an electrical inspector by the International Code Council or the International Association of Electrical Inspectors and licensing by the state as a journeyman or master electrician is required;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a municipality or county that has been granted local enforcement authority under this subsection fails to maintain employment of an inspector holding any certification required by this subsection, enforcement authority shall revert to the department one hundred twenty (120) days after the last day the properly certified inspector has left the employment of the municipality or county. It shall be the responsibility of the municipality or county to notify the department upon the termination of employment of any certified inspector required by this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section a local governmental entity is authorized to assume sole plan review authority, and, in accordance with W.S. 35-9-107(a)(iv), that entity has sole construction inspection authority on the approved plans and sole authority for periodic fire and life safety inspections on state owned or leased buildings. For the purpose of this section, school buildings shall be construed to be state buildings. If local code provisions are more stringent than adopted state codes, the local code prevails.

                  <p>(i) If sole plan review authority is requested, certification of a plan reviewer by the international conference of building officials or the International Code Council;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If code enforcement authority for fire and building codes is requested, certification of a fire inspector or building inspector by the International Code Council or the International Conference of Building Officials;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If code enforcement authority for the electrical code is requested, certification of an electrical inspector by the International Code Council or the International Association of Electrical Inspectors and licensing by the state as a master electrician.</p>
                  <p>(c) If a municipality or county has assumed enforcement authority for only one (1) or two (2) of the fire, building and electrical standards, the municipality or county shall deliver notice of any project plans submitted to the municipality or county for approval to the department. The notice of the project shall be delivered within ten (10) days of receiving plans from the applicant.</p>
                  <p>(d) A municipality or county which has enforcement authority under this section shall create its own appeals boards to determine the suitability of alternate materials and types of construction and to interpret and grant variances from adopted codes or standards. The boards shall be appointed and removed by the governing body of the municipality or county, but the person making the decision upon which the appeal is based shall not be a member of the appeal board.</p>
                  <p>(e) A decision rendered by the local municipal or county appeals board pursuant to subsection (d) of this section may be appealed to the council on fire prevention and electrical safety in buildings for a final decision. A decision of the council may be appealed to the appropriate district court.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any appeal to a local board under subsection (d) of this section or the council under subsection (e) of this section shall be heard within thirty (30) days of the request for appeal.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-9-156. Local response authority.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Every political subdivision of the state shall designate a local emergency response authority for responding to and reporting of hazardous material or weapons of mass destruction incidents that occur within its jurisdiction. The designation of a local emergency response authority and copies of any accompanying agreements and other pertinent documentation created pursuant to this section shall be filed with the director, office of homeland security within seven (7) days of the agreement being reduced to writing and signed by all appropriate persons.</p>
                  <p>(b) Every local emergency response authority shall coordinate the response to an incident occurring within its jurisdiction in a fashion consistent with standard incident command protocols. The local emergency response authority shall also coordinate the response to an incident which initially occurs within its jurisdiction but which spreads to another jurisdiction. If an incident occurs on a boundary between two (2) jurisdictions or in an area not readily ascertainable, the first local emergency response authority arriving at the scene shall coordinate the initial emergency response and shall be responsible for seeking reimbursement for the incident on behalf of all responding authorities entitled to reimbursement under W.S. 35-9-157(a).</p>
                  <p>(c) Any unusual incident involving hazardous materials or weapons of mass destruction and any incident involving a clandestine laboratory operation shall be investigated to determine if a criminal act has occurred until it is determined otherwise. To ensure preservation of evidence while mitigating the threat to life and property under this subsection, a command structure with primary command authority by the appropriate law enforcement agency shall be implemented.</p>
                  <p>(d) The incident commander shall declare an incident ended when he has determined the threat to public health and safety has ended. Until the incident commander has declared the threat to public safety has ended the incident commander shall have the authority to issue an order on behalf of the political subdivision that any portion of the building, structure or land is uninhabitable or contaminated, secure the portion of the building, structure or land that is uninhabitable or contaminated and take appropriate steps to minimize exposure to identified or suspected contamination at the site or premise.</p>
                  <p>If the subject of the site or premise is commercial real estate, the incident commander shall limit the declaration of uninhabitable or contaminated to the areas affected by the clandestine laboratory operation and shall not declare the entire commercial real estate uninhabitable or contaminated unless the entire commercial property has been documented and determined uninhabitable or contaminated using the standards promulgated by the state emergency response commission under W.S. 35-9-153(h). The incident commander shall provide written notice to the commercial real estate owner, describing with specificity the extent of the commercial property deemed uninhabitable or contaminated. Any property that is ordered uninhabitable or contaminated under this subsection shall only be transferred or sold prior to remediation if full, written disclosure is made to the prospective purchaser, attached to the earnest money receipt if any, and shall accompany the sale documents but not be a part of the deed nor shall it be recorded. The transferor or seller shall notify the incident commander of the transfer or sale within ten (10) days of the transfer or sale. Receipt of full written disclosure under this subsection constitutes a full release of liability on the part of the seller or transferor and acceptance of liability on the part of the buyer or transferee unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the transferor and transferee.</p>
                  <p>(e) The order issued under subsection (d) of this section shall be in writing, shall state the grounds for the order and shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of the county in which the building or structure is situated. A copy of the order shall be served in accordance with the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure upon the owner and any occupants of the building or structure with a written notice that the order has been filed and shall remain in force, unless the owner or occupant files his objections or answer with the clerk of the district court within the time specified in subsection (f) of this section. A copy of the order shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the building or structure.</p>
                  <p>(f) Within twenty (20) days of service of an order issued under subsection (d) of this section, the owner or occupant may file with the clerk of the district court and serve upon the political subdivision issuing the order, an answer denying the existence of any of the allegations in the order. If no answer is filed and served, the court shall affirm the order declaring the site uninhabitable and fix a time when the order shall be enforced. If an answer is filed and served, the court shall hear and determine the issues raised as set forth in subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) The court shall hold a hearing within eleven (11) days from the date of the filing of the answer. If the court sustains the order, the court shall fix a time within which the order shall be enforced. Otherwise, the court shall annul or set aside the order declaring the property to be uninhabitable.</p>
                  <p>(h) An appeal from the judgment of the district court may be taken by any party to the proceeding in accordance with the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-9-158. Expense recovery and civil remedies.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The decision to commence a civil action to recover expenses shall be made by the state, political subdivision of the state or other unit of local government, including local emergency response authorities and regional response teams, in consultation with the attorney general or county or municipal attorney as appropriate. With respect to a civil action to recover expenses for a clandestine laboratory operation incident, the governing body shall first make such claim against the party responsible for the clandestine laboratory operation and shall use the proceeds of any asset forfeiture directly related to the building or structure containing the clandestine laboratory to offset expenses, including expenses for remediation of the site. Claims of expenses for remediation for a clandestine laboratory operation incident may be made against the owner of a building or structure containing a clandestine laboratory operation only as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The law enforcement agency acting as an emergency responder shall keep an accurate account of the expenses incurred in carrying out the remediation and shall report the actions and present a statement of the expenses incurred and the amount received from any salvage sale to the court for approval and allowance;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The court shall examine, correct, if necessary, and allow the expense account to the extent the expenses exceed those recovered from the party responsible for the clandestine laboratory operation. If the owner did not know or could not with reasonable diligence have known of the clandestine laboratory operation, the amount recoverable from the owner shall be limited to one percent (1%) of the fair market value as determined by the county assessor of that portion of the building, structure or land declared uninhabitable by the incident commander;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The amount allowed by the court constitutes a lien against the real property on which a clandestine laboratory operation incident occurred or was situated. If the amount is not paid by the owner within six (6) months after the amount has been examined and approved by the court, the real estate may be sold under court order by the county sheriff in the manner provided by law for the sale of real estate upon execution;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The proceeds of the sale shall be paid into the treasury of the governing body of the law enforcement agency acting as the emergency responder. If the amount received as salvage or upon sale exceeds the expenses allowed by the court, the court shall direct payment of the surplus to the previous owner for his use and benefit;</p>
                  <p>(v) Whenever any debt which is a lien pursuant to this subsection is paid and satisfied, the law enforcement agency acting as an emergency responder shall file notice of satisfaction of the lien statement in the office of the county clerk of any county in which the lien is filed; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) If the expenses of the law enforcement agency exceed the amount allowed by the court pursuant to paragraph</p>
                  <p>(ii) of this subsection, the law enforcement agency acting as an emergency responder may apply for reimbursement of the excess expenses from the funds as authorized by W.S. 1-40-118(g)(i)(C). If the expenses further exceed amounts available under W.S. 1-40-118(g)(i)(C), the emergency responder may apply for reimbursement from the clandestine laboratory remediation account created pursuant to W.S. 35-9-159(f).</p>
                  <p>(b) Prior to commencing a civil action for recovery of expenses pursuant to this act, the governmental entity shall afford the person alleged to owe those expenses a reasonable opportunity to engage in nonbinding mediation. Each party to mediation shall bear his own costs and expenses, including a proportionate share of the fees of the mediator.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the event that the attorney general or county or municipal attorney prevails in a civil action for reimbursement under this act, the court shall award costs of collection including reasonable attorney's fees, investigation expenses and litigation expenses.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any person who receives remuneration for the emergency response expenses pursuant to any other federal or state law shall be precluded from recovering reimbursement for those expenses under this act. Nothing in this act shall otherwise affect or modify in any way the obligations or liability of any person under any other provision of state or federal law, including common law, for damages, injury or loss resulting from the release of any hazardous material or for remedial action or the expenses of remedial action for the release.</p>

                  <p>(a) This act shall not apply to releases of a hazardous material where there is an immediate on-site private industry response capability to the emergency. The exemption under this subsection shall apply only if the private industry files evidence of its immediate response capability to respond to emergency releases of hazardous materials that may be present at the site of the private industry or the responsible party and incident commander have determined that the local or regional response team is no longer required and should be released. The exemption shall not apply if emergency responders responded to a release of hazardous materials at the request of the on-site private industry where the emergency occurred.</p>

                  <p>(a) As an alternative to the procedures provided by W.S. 35-9-210, a county commission fire protection district comprised of lands within unincorporated areas of the county which are not within existing fire protection districts and which are currently receiving fire protection or public safety services from an existing fire department funded by the county may be created under the following procedure:</p>
                  <p>(i) The board of county commissioners may, by resolution, identify lands to be included within the proposed county commission fire protection district and submit the question of establishing the district to the electors of the proposed district at the next general election. The board shall provide notice that it will consider a resolution brought pursuant to this paragraph at least thirty (30) days prior to the meeting at which the resolution will be considered. Notice of the election to establish the district shall be given as required by W.S. 22-29-110;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the establishment of the district is defeated at the election, the board may refuse to provide fire and public safety protection to the area within the proposed district commencing with the succeeding fiscal year. If a majority of the voters in the proposed district voting at the election vote for the establishment of the district, the board of county commissioners shall enter that fact upon its records and the district is established. Following establishment of the district:</p>
                  <p>(A) Pursuant to the assessed property valuation requirements of W.S. 35-9-202(e) the board of county commissions shall appoint either three (3) or five (5) members to the board who are residents and property owners within the district and who shall serve on the board until the next election of directors, at which time the members of the board shall be elected in accordance with W.S. 35-9-202;</p>
                  <p>(B) The board of county commissioners shall annually levy a tax on the taxable property in the district as provided by W.S. 35-9-203 and shall expend the proceeds of the tax solely for the support of the fire department or agency providing fire protection or public safety services for the property within the district or outside the district pursuant to a mutual aid agreement as provided in W.S. 35-9-201.</p>
                  <p>(b) A county commission fire protection district created under this section may, as a condition for a position with the district, require applicants to submit to fingerprinting in order to obtain state and national criminal history record information.</p>

                  <p>(A) The owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the area of the privately owned lands included within the entire original district who constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the taxpayers who are landowners within the entire original district based upon the last completed assessment roll; or</p>
                  <p>(B) The owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the area of the privately owned lands included within the area of the proposed detracted area who constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of taxpayers who are landowners within the proposed detracted area based upon the last completed assessment roll.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The districts have in place standard operating procedures that ensure that both districts have the ability to provide fire protection to the satisfaction of the commissioners;</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in this act, cigarettes may not be offered for sale or sold to persons located in this state unless the cigarettes have been tested and have met the required performance standard specified in this section, the manufacturer has filed a written certification with the department of revenue in accordance with W.S. 35-9-804 and the cigarettes have been marked in accordance with W.S. 35-9-805. The following testing requirements shall apply:</p>
                  <p>(i) Cigarette testing shall be conducted in accordance with the American society of testing and materials ("ASTM") standard E2187-04, "Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes," in effect on February 1, 2010. The state fire marshal may adopt a subsequent ASTM standard upon a written finding that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with ASTM standard E2187-04 and the performance standard in this section;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Testing shall be conducted on ten (10) layers of filter paper;</p>
                  <p>(iii) No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the cigarettes tested in a test trial in accordance with this section shall exhibit full length burns. Forty (40) replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The performance standard required by this section shall be applied only to a complete test trial;</p>
                  <p>(v) Written certifications shall be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been accredited pursuant to standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO"), or other comparable accreditation standard required by the state fire marshal;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability of the testing results. The repeatability value shall not be greater than nineteen hundredths (0.19);</p>
                  <p>(vii) This section does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistent with this act for any other purpose;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Testing performed or sponsored by the state fire marshal to determine a cigarette's compliance with the performance standard required by this section shall be conducted in accordance with this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Each cigarette listed in a certification submitted pursuant to W.S. 35-9-804 that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard set forth in this section shall have at least two (2) nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. At least one (1) complete band shall be located at least fifteen (15) millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. Cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design shall have at least two (2) bands fully located at least fifteen (15) millimeters from the lighting end and at least ten (10) millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column. For nonfiltered cigarettes the bands shall be at least ten (10) millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the state fire marshal determines that a cigarette cannot be tested in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) of this section, the manufacturer shall propose a test method and performance standard. If the state fire marshal approves the proposed test method and determines that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section, that test method and performance standard may be used to certify the cigarette pursuant to W.S. 35-9-804.</p>
                  <p>(d) The state fire marshal shall authorize a manufacturer to employ an alternative test method and performance standard to certify a cigarette for sale in this state if the fire marshal determines that:</p>
                  <p>(i) Another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include the proposed alternative test method and performance standard;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The other state's testing method and performance standard are the same as those adopted pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The officials responsible for implementing the other state's requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette as meeting the fire safety standards of that state's law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this section; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) There is no reasonable basis to reject the alternative testing method.</p>
                  <p>(e) Manufacturers shall maintain copies of reports of all tests conducted on all cigarettes offered for sale for three (3) years and shall make copies available upon written request by the department of revenue or attorney general. Any manufacturer failing to make copies of the requested reports available within sixty (60) days of receipt of the request shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each day after the sixtieth day that the manufacturer fails to make copies available.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 55, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(g) The requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall not prohibit:</p>
                  <p>(i) Wholesale or retail dealers from selling after the effective date of this act the dealer's inventory of cigarettes existing on the effective date of this act if the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that state tax stamps were affixed to the cigarettes prior to the effective date and the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that the inventory was purchased prior to the effective date of this act in a comparable quantity to the inventory purchase during the same period of the prior year; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The sale of cigarettes solely for the purpose of consumer testing using only the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably necessary for the testing. For purposes of this paragraph the term "consumer testing" means an assessment of cigarettes that is conducted by a manufacturer, or under the control and direction of a manufacturer, for the purpose of evaluating consumer acceptance of the cigarettes.</p>

                  <p>(v) Designate at the earliest date and to the extent possible those areas of the state which are very rare or uncommon and have particular historical, archaeological, wildlife, surface geological, botanical or scenic value. When areas of privately owned lands are to be considered for such designation, the council shall give notice to the record owner and hold hearing thereon, within a county in which the area, or major portion thereof, to be so designated is located, in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. No new designations shall be made pursuant to this paragraph after July 1, 2011, but the council shall retain the authority to remove designations made prior to that date;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Adopt and when applicable, enforce the provisions of rule 11 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure in a contested hearing conducted by the council.

                  <p>(iii) Affirm, modify or deny the issuance of orders to cease and desist any act or practice in violation of the laws, rules, regulations, standards or orders issued or administered by the department or any division thereof. Upon application by the council, the district court of the county in which the act or practice is taking place shall issue its order to comply with the cease and desist order, and violation of the court order may be punished as a contempt.</p>
                  <p>(d) The council may employ an executive officer and staff who shall serve at the pleasure of the council. The executive officer and other staff members shall perform duties as the council may assign, including preparing meeting facilities and completing administrative, secretarial and other functions. The department of administration and information shall provide suitable office space for the executive officer and other staff members and shall ensure that any employment authorized under this subsection complies with title 9, chapter 2, article 10 of the Wyoming statutes.

                  <p>(iii) Recommend to the director, after consultation with the advisory board, regulations to prevent construction, modification or operation of any source at any location where emissions from such source will prevent the attainment or maintenance of a state or national standard.</p>

                  <p>(B) Has the potential to emit ten (10) tons per year of any single hazardous air pollutant or twenty-five (25) tons per year of any combination of hazardous air pollutants as defined by section 112 of the Clean Air Act. Emissions from any oil or gas exploration or production well (with its associated equipment) and emissions from any pipeline compressor or pump station shall not be aggregated with emissions from other similar units, whether or not such units are in a contiguous area or under common control, to determine whether such units or stations are major sources; or</p>

The department shall approve or disapprove a completed application, consistent with the procedures established under W.S. 35-11-204 for consideration of such applications, and shall issue or deny the permit, within eighteen (18) months after the date of receipt thereof, except that the department shall establish a phased schedule for acting on permit applications submitted within the first full year after the effective date of the operating permit program, or a partial or interim program. Any such schedule shall assure that at least one-third (1/3) of the permits will be acted on by the department annually over a period of not to exceed three (3) years after the effective date.

                  <p>(c) Except for sources required to have a permit before construction or modification under the applicable requirements of this article or the Clean Air Act, if an applicant has submitted a timely and complete application for a permit or a renewal of a permit required by the operating permit program, but final action has not been taken on the application, the source's failure to have a permit shall not be a violation of W.S. 35-11-203, unless the delay in final action was due to the failure of the applicant to timely submit information required or requested to process the application. No source required to have a permit under the operating permit program shall be in violation of W.S. 35-11-203 before the date on which the source is required to submit an application under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-206. Operating permit requirements and conditions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Every permit issued under the operating permit program shall include enforceable emission limitations and standards, a schedule of compliance, a requirement that the permittee submit to the department no less often than every six (6) months, the results of any required monitoring, and other conditions as are necessary to assure compliance with applicable requirements established pursuant to this article and the Clean Air Act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The department may by rule prescribe procedures and methods for determining compliance and for monitoring and analysis of pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act and this article, but continuous emissions monitoring need not be required if alternative methods are available that provide sufficiently reliable and timely information for determining compliance. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any continuous emissions monitoring requirement of title IV of the Clean Air Act, or where required elsewhere in the Clean Air Act.</p>
                  <p>(c) Every permit issued under the operating permit program shall set forth inspection, entry, monitoring, compliance certification and reporting requirements to assure compliance with the permit terms and conditions. Monitoring and reporting requirements shall conform to any applicable regulation under subsection (b) of this section. Any report required to be submitted by a permit issued to a corporation under the operating permit program shall be signed by a responsible corporate official, who shall certify its accuracy.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department may, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, issue a general permit covering numerous similar sources. Any general permit shall comply with all requirements applicable to permits under title V of the Clean Air Act and the operating permit program. No source covered by a general permit shall thereby be relieved from the obligation to file an application under W.S. 35-11-205.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations at multiple temporary locations. No such permit shall be issued unless it includes conditions that will assure compliance with all the requirements of the operating permit program and the Clean Air Act at all authorized locations, including, but not limited to, ambient standards and compliance with any applicable increment or visibility requirements under part C of title I of the Clean Air Act. Any such permit shall in addition require the owner or operator to notify the department in advance of each change in location. The department may require a separate permit fee for operations at each location.</p>
                  <p>(f) Every permit issued pursuant to the operating permit program shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Be issued for a fixed term of five (5) years unless the department makes a finding, after public comment and hearing, and based on substantial evidence in the record, that an operating permit term of less than five (5) years is necessary to protect the public health and the environment except that operating permits to any affected source as defined in section 501 of the Clean Air Act shall be issued for no less and no more than five (5) years;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Be subject to termination, modification, revocation or reissuance for cause;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Allow for operational flexibility at the permitted facility without revising the permit; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Be subject to revision by the department to incorporate applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act and this article which are promulgated after the permit is issued if the remaining term of the permit is for a term of three (3) or more years. Any revision required by this paragraph shall be acted on by the department within the time limits provided in W.S. 35-11-205(a).</p>

                  <p>(ii) That are within fifty (50) miles of the source.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department shall provide an opportunity for states notified pursuant to subsection (b) of this section to submit written recommendations respecting the issuance of the permit and its terms and conditions. If any part of those recommendations are not accepted by the department it shall notify the state submitting the recommendations and the environmental protection agency in writing of its failure to accept those recommendations and the reasons therefor.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon receipt of timely objection by the environmental protection agency under title V of the Clean Air Act the department shall not issue any permit under the operating permit program unless it is revised and issued in accordance with section 505(c) of the Clean Air Act. Any permit issued under the operating permit program shall be subject to revocation or revision by the department throughout the period of time that EPA may object under title V of the Clean Air Act.</p>

                  <p>(a) The department shall implement a permit fee system and schedule of fees adequate to cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs of reviewing and acting upon any construction and modification permits under this article and developing, implementing and administering the operating permit program including the small business technical assistance program.</p>
                  <p>(b) Permit fees shall be assessed against operators of sources applying for any permit under this article and annually thereafter for the duration of the permit. The fee for operating sources shall be based on the emissions of each regulated pollutant, as defined in section 502(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Clean Air Act. The department shall exclude any amount of regulated pollutant emitted by any source in excess of four thousand (4,000) tons per year in determining the amount of fee required for any operating source. A fee shall be assessed upon applicants for construction and modification permits based on costs to the department in reviewing and acting upon those permit applications. The department shall develop a fee structure which equitably assesses the fees based on emissions for operating sources and projected costs of reviewing and acting upon construction and modification permits sufficient to recover the amount reviewed by the joint appropriations committee and appropriated by the legislature for implementing the operating permit program. The fee structure and appropriation shall be based upon measurable goals and approved by the joint appropriations committee prior to implementation.</p>
                  <p>The department shall prepare a biennium report for review by the joint minerals, business and economic development committee by October 31 of the year prior to the Wyoming legislative budget session. Permit fees shall cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs including the costs of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Reviewing and acting upon any permit application including construction and modification permit applications;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Implementing and enforcing permits;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Emissions and ambient monitoring;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Preparing regulations and guidance;</p>
                  <p>(v) Modeling analyses and demonstrations;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Preparing emission and source inventories and tracking emissions;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Permit-related functions performed by the department;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Development and administration of the state small business assistance program; and</p>
                  <p>(ix) Information management activities.</p>
                  <p>(c) The fees collected by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a separate account, and shall be subject to appropriation by the legislature to the department solely for permitting construction and modification and for the development and administration of the construction, modification and operating permit programs.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department shall give written notice of the amount of the fee to be assessed and the basis for the assessment to the operator of the source. The operator may appeal the assessment to the council within twenty (20) days after receipt of the written notice. The appeal shall be based only upon the allegation that the particular assessment is erroneous or excessive and may not be based upon the entire fee schedule adopted to fund the permitting programs. The contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act shall apply to any appeal under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) If any part of the assessment is not appealed it shall be paid to the department upon receipt of the written notice.</p>
                  <p>(f) The department may reduce any fee required under the operating permit program to take into account the financial resources of small business stationary sources.</p>
                  <p>(g) There shall be no double counting of the regulated emissions for the purpose of fee determination.</p>
                  <p>(h) Fees under this section, for sources subject to the operating permit program as enumerated in W.S. 35-11-203(a), shall not be assessed for tailpipe emissions from any nonroad vehicle as defined under section 201 of the Clean Air Act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Effective March 31, 1999, neither the department nor the council shall propose or promulgate any new rule or regulation intended in whole or in part to reduce emissions as called for by the Kyoto Protocol, from the residential, commercial, industrial, electric utility, transportation, agricultural, energy or mining sectors.</p>
                  <p>(b) In the absence of a resolution or other act of the legislature approving same, the director of the department shall not submit to the United States environmental protection agency or to any other agency of the federal government any legally enforceable commitments related to the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
                  <p>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or to impede state or private participation in any on-going voluntary initiatives to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, the United States environmental protection agency's green lights program, the United States department of energy's climate challenge program and similar state and federal initiatives relying on voluntary participation.</p>
                  <p>(d) This section shall remain in effect until repealed by an act of the Wyoming legislature or until ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the United States senate and enactment of federal legislation implementing the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
                  <p>(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (d) of this section and pursuant to the provisions of subsections (e) through (k) of this section, the department and council shall adopt regulations to amend Wyoming's Clean Air Act state implementation plan and Wyoming's Title V operating permit program to the extent necessary to obtain state primacy over the regulation of greenhouse gases for those sources that would otherwise be subject to federal regulation for greenhouse gases by the United States environmental protection agency. The department and council may promulgate new source performance standards for greenhouse gases that are no more stringent than federal greenhouse gas new source performance standards.</p>
                  <p>(f) In no event shall any greenhouse gas emission regulations, new source performance standards or potential to emit thresholds promulgated pursuant to subsection (e) of this section be more stringent than those imposed or required by federal law. Regulations under subsection (e) of this section shall only regulate those gases identified by the United States environmental protection agency as greenhouse gases.</p>
                  <p>(g) Notwithstanding W.S. 35-11-203(a), the department and the council are authorized to determine by regulation potential to emit thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions which are no more stringent than those imposed or required by federal law.</p>
                  <p>(h) The department may submit an amended state implementation plan providing for regulation of greenhouse gases to the United States environmental protection agency for approval.</p>
                  <p>(i) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 39, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed By Laws 2013, Ch. 39, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(j) Subsections (e) through (k) of this section and the authority granted in subsection (e) of this section to the department and the council to promulgate and adopt greenhouse gas regulations and all regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (e) of this section are repealed upon the occurrence of any one (1) of the following events:</p>
                  <p>(i) The United States congress enacts a law prohibiting the United States environmental protection agency from regulating greenhouse gases; or</p>

                  <p>(ii) Expend funds from the account under W.S. 35-11-424 to remedy and abate any immediate danger to human health, safety and welfare.</p>
                  <p>(o) If the forfeited bond or other financial assurance instrument is inadequate to cover the costs to carry out the activities specified in subsection (d) of this section, or in any case where the department has expended account monies under subsection (n) of this section, the attorney general shall bring suit to recover the cost of performing the activities where recovery is deemed possible.</p>
                  <p>(p) When the director determines that the violation has been remedied or the damage abated, the director shall release that portion of the bond or financial assurance instrument being held under paragraph (d)(ii) of this section. When the director determines that closure activities have been successfully completed at any commercial oil field waste disposal facility, the director shall release that portion of the bond or financial assurance instrument being held to guarantee performance of activities specified in subparagraphs (d)(i)(A) through (E) of this section. The remaining portion of the bond or financial assurance instrument shall be held for a period of not less than five (5) years after the date of facility closure, or so long thereafter as necessary to assure proper performance of any post-closure activities specified in subparagraph (d)(i)(F) of this section. The retained portion of the bond or other financial assurance instrument may be returned to the facility operator at an earlier date if the director determines that the facility has been adequately stabilized and that environmental monitoring or control systems have demonstrated that the facility closure is protective of public health and the environment consistent with the purposes of this act.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-309. Legislative policy and intent.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The legislature declares that all water, including collections of still water and waters associated with wetlands within the borders of this state are property of the state. The legislature further declares that water is one of Wyoming's most important natural resources, and the protection, development and management of Wyoming's water resources is essential for the long-term public health, safety, general welfare and economic security of Wyoming and its citizens.</p>
                  <p>(b) The legislature finds that agriculture, energy development, mining, highway construction and timbering are important industries in this state and that industrial concerns must be accommodated in the protection of wetlands. Wetlands can have an impact on industry practices. Even though property taxes are generally paid on such lands, wetlands provide limited economic return to the landowner. Wetland policies can obstruct water development projects and water management projects for private industry as well as public entities and can affect other developments.</p>
                  <p>(c) The legislature finds that wetlands are considered important for a variety of reasons. Wetlands provide the habitat base for the production and maintenance of waterfowl and are sometimes critical to the survival of endangered plants and animals. Wetlands also serve to moderate water flow and have value as natural flood control mechanisms, can aid in water purification by trapping, filtering and storing sediment and other pollutants and by recycling nutrients, and can serve as groundwater recharge and discharge areas. Wetlands also function as nursery areas for numerous aquatic animal species and are habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species, and provide vital habitat for resident wildlife. Wetlands also can provide scientific, aesthetic and recreational benefits. The legislature therefore concludes that wetlands and values associated therewith deserve to be effectively managed, protected and preserved.</p>
                  <p>(d) The legislature recognizes that significant differences exist in Wyoming between naturally occurring wetlands and those wetlands that result from human activities. Because portions of Wyoming are arid or semiarid, water was diverted from streams and rivers for irrigating cropland, resulting in the creation of wetlands. These wetlands have partially compensated for wetlands losses. Additionally, road and highway construction, petroleum industry operations and other human activities have created wetlands where none previously existed. While these man-made wetlands are equally as important as naturally occurring wetlands, having the same characteristics and providing the same values and functions, management flexibility is required to acknowledge their different origins and to protect the property rights of landowners and water right holders.</p>
                  <p>(e) In view of the legislative findings and conclusions of the importance of wetlands, water development and management, and industry in Wyoming it is hereby declared to be the wetlands policy of this state that water management and development and wetland preservation activities should be balanced to protect and accommodate private property, industry, water and wetland interests and objectives.</p>

                  <p>(a) The geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide is prohibited unless authorized by a permit issued by the department.</p>
                  <p>(b) The injection of carbon dioxide for purposes of a project for enhanced recovery of oil or other minerals approved by the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(c) If an oil and gas operator converts to geologic sequestration upon the cessation of oil and gas recovery operations, or injects carbon dioxide for the primary purpose of long term storage that results in an increased risk to an underground source of drinking water as compared to enhanced oil recovery operations, then regulation of the geologic sequestration facility and the geologic sequestration site shall be transferred to the department. If the oil and gas operator does not convert to geologic sequestration, the wells shall be plugged and abandoned according to the rules of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. When determining whether an oil and gas recovery operation is injecting carbon dioxide for the primary purpose of long term storage that results in an increased risk to an underground source of drinking water as compared to enhanced oil recovery operations, the director shall consider the findings and recommendations of the supervisor of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. The supervisor shall make his determination following a hearing of the oil and gas conservation commission examiners held under the commission's rules and regulations promulgated under Title 30, Chapter 5 of the Wyoming statutes. The supervisor shall provide the operator and director with notice of the supervisor's findings and recommendations under this subsection and an opportunity for a public hearing before the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. Within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice as provided in this subsection, the operator may request a hearing before the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. If both a change in primary purpose to long term storage and an increased risk to an underground source of drinking water as compared to enhanced oil recovery operations are found to have occurred, the commission shall recommend transfer of regulation of the operation to the department.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-316. Unitization of geologic sequestration sites; hearings on application, order; modifications.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Upon receipt of an application under W.S. 35-11-315, the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission shall promptly set the matter for hearing, and in addition to any notice otherwise required by law or the commission's rules, shall cause the applicant to give notice of the hearing, specifying the time and place of hearing, and describing briefly its purpose and the land and pore space affected, to be mailed by certified mail at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing to all persons whose names and addresses are required to be listed in the application.</p>
                  <p>(b) After considering the application and hearing the evidence offered in connection therewith, the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission shall enter an order setting forth the following findings and approving the proposed plan of unitization and proposed operating plan, if any, if the commission finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The material allegations of the application are substantially true;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The purposes specified in W.S. 35-11-314 will be served by granting the application;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The application outlines operations that will comply with environmental requirements;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Granting the application will facilitate the use and production of Wyoming energy resources;</p>
                  <p>(v) The quantity of pore space storage capacity, and method used to determine the quantity of pore space storage capacity allocated to each separately owned tract within the unit area represents, so far as can be practically determined, each tract's actual share of the pore space to be used in the sequestration activity;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The method by which the allocation of economic benefits generated from use of pore space within the unit area between pore space owners; and between pore space owners and the unit operator or others is fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the costs required to capture, transport and sequester the carbon dioxide;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The method of generating economic benefits from the use of pore space in the unit area is fair and equitable and is reasonably designed to maximize the value of such use;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Other requirements specified by rules or regulations adopted by the oil and gas conservation commission have been met.</p>
                  <p>(c) No order of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission authorizing the commencement of unit operations shall become effective until the plan of unitization has been signed or in writing ratified or approved by those persons who own at least eighty percent (80%) of the pore space storage capacity within the unit area. If such consent has not been obtained at the time the commissioner's order is made, the commission shall, upon application, hold supplemental hearings and make findings as may be required to determine when and if the consent will be obtained. The commission shall require the applicant to give notice of a supplemental hearing by regular mail at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing to each person owning interests in the pore space in the proposed unit area whose name and address was required by W.S. 35-11-315(a) to be listed in the application for the unit operations. If the required percentages of consent have not been obtained within a period of six (6) months from and after the date on which the order of approval is made, the order shall be ineffective and revoked by the commission, unless, for good cause shown, the commission extends that time. Any interested person may file an application with the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission requesting an order applicable only to the proposed unit area described in the application which shall provide for the percentage of approval or ratification to be reduced from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). The application shall contain the information required by W.S. 35-11-315(a) and any order of the commission entered pursuant to the application shall comply with subsection (b) of this section. Notice of the hearing on the application shall be given in the same manner and to the same persons as required by subsection (a) of this section. If the commission finds that negotiations were being conducted since July 1, 2009, or have been conducted for a period of at least nine (9) months prior to the filing of the application, that the applicant has participated in the negotiations diligently and in good faith, and that the percentage of approval or ratification required by this subsection cannot be obtained, the commission may reduce any percentage of approval or ratification required by this section from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). The order shall affect only the unit area described in the application and shall operate only to approve the proposed plan of unitization and proposed operating plan and to reduce the required percentage of approval or ratification thereof and shall not change any other requirement contained in this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) From and after the effective date of an order of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission entered under the provisions of this section, the operation of the unit area defined in the order by persons other than the unit operator or persons acting under the unit operator's authority, or except in the manner and to the extent provided in the plan of unitization approved by the order, shall be unlawful and is hereby prohibited.</p>
                  <p>(e) Unless otherwise provided in this section, an order entered by the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission under this section may be amended in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order or previous agreement: provided, no amendatory order shall change the assignments of pore space storage capacity between existing pore space owners in the unit area as established by the original order or previous agreement, except with the written consent of those persons who own at least eighty percent (80%) of the pore space storage capacity in the unit area, nor change any allocation of costs as established by the original order or previous agreement, except with the written consent of those persons who own at least eighty percent (80%) of the unit pore space storage capacity. If consent has not been obtained at the time the commission order is made, the commission shall, upon application, hold supplemental hearings and make findings as may be required to determine when and if such consent will be obtained. The commission shall require the applicant to give notice of a supplemental hearing by regular mail at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing to each person owning interests in the unit area whose name and address was required by the provisions of W.S. 35-11-315(a)(iii) to be listed in the application for the unit operations. If the required percentages of consent have not been obtained within a period of six (6) months from and after the date on which the order of approval is made, the order shall be ineffective and revoked by the commission, unless, for good cause shown, the commission extends that time. Any interested person may file an application with the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission requesting an order applicable only to the unit area described in the application which shall provide for the percentage of approval or ratification to be reduced from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). The application shall contain the information required by W.S. 35-11-315(a) and any order of the commission entered pursuant to the application shall comply with subsection (b) of this section. Notice of the hearing on the application shall be given in the same manner and to the same persons as required by subsection (a) of this section. If the commission finds that negotiations were being conducted since July 1, 2009 or have been conducted for a period of at least nine (9) months prior to the filing of the application, that the applicant has participated in the negotiations diligently and in good faith, and that the percentage of approval or ratification required by this subsection cannot be obtained, the commission may reduce any percentage of approval or ratification required by this section from eighty percent (80%) to seventy-five percent (75%). The order shall affect only the unit area described in the application and operate only to reduce the required percentage of approval or ratification necessary for amending the assignment of pore space and shall not change any other requirement contained in this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) The Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission, upon its own motion or upon application, and with notice and hearing, may modify its order regarding the operation, size or other characteristic of the unit area in order to prevent or assist in preventing a substantial inequity resulting from operation of the unit, provided that no such modification may amend any permit issued under W.S. 35-11-313.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any owner of pore space within a geologic sequestration site who has not been included within a unitization application or order authorizing a unit under this section, may petition for inclusion in the unit area. The petition shall be filed with the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission and shall describe the petitioner's legal entitlement to the pore space, the location of the pore space, whether the pore space is included within any permitting area applicable to the unit area and the bases for inclusion in the unit area. The petition shall be accompanied by a deposit of money sufficient to pay all costs of the inclusion proceedings. The commission shall require the petitioner to publish a notice of filing of the petition which notice shall state the filing of the petition, the name of the petitioner, the location of the pore space and the prayer of the petitioner. The notice shall notify all interested persons to appear at a specified time and place and to show cause, in writing, if any they have, why the petition should not be granted. The commission at the time and place mentioned in the notice shall proceed to hear the petition and all objections thereto and shall thereafter grant or deny the petition. The filing of the petition shall be deemed and taken as an assent by each and all petitioners to the inclusion in the unit of the pore space mentioned in the petition or any part thereof. If the petition is granted, the petitioner shall be considered to have been a member of the unit since its inception and, upon the payment of any costs paid by unit members, shall be entitled to all economic benefits received by unit members since the inception of the unit provided that no unit modification affects any permit issued under W.S. 35-11-313. The oil and gas conservation commission shall adopt rules providing for the fair and equitable determination of pore space storage capacity for each successful petitioner and the means by which successful petitioners shall be paid the economic benefits to which they are entitled under this subsection, including, if necessary, a reallocation of economic benefits among unit members.</p>
                  <p>(h) A certified copy of any order of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission entered under the provisions of this section shall be entitled to be recorded in the land records of the county clerk for the counties where all or any portion of the unit area is located, and the recordation shall constitute notice thereof to all persons.</p>
                  <p>(j) No provision of W.S. 35-11-314 through 35-11-317 shall be construed to confer on any person the right of eminent domain and no order for unitization issued under this section shall act so as to grant to any person the right of eminent domain.</p>
                  <p>(k) No order for unitization issued under this section shall act so as to grant any person a right of use or access to a surface estate if that person would not otherwise have such a right.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created the Wyoming geologic sequestration special revenue account. The account shall be administered by the director and all funds in the account shall be transmitted to the state treasurer for credit to the account and shall be invested by the state treasurer as authorized under W.S. 9-4-715(a), (d) and (e) in a manner to obtain the highest return possible consistent with the preservation of the corpus. Any interest earned on the investment or deposit of monies into the fund shall remain in the fund and shall not be credited to the general fund. All funds in the account are continuously appropriated for use by the director consistent with this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) The account shall consist of all monies collected by the department to measure, monitor and verify Wyoming geologic sequestration sites following site closure certification, release of all financial assurance instruments and termination of the permit. The department shall promulgate rules necessary to collect monies in an amount reasonably calculated to pay the costs of measuring, monitoring and verifying the sites.</p>
                  <p>(c) Funds in the account shall be used only for the measurement, monitoring and verification of geologic sequestration sites following site closure certification, release of all financial assurance instruments and termination of the permit.</p>
                  <p>(d) The existence, management and expenditure of funds from this account shall not constitute a waiver by the state of Wyoming of its immunity from suit, nor does it constitute an assumption of any liability by the state for geologic sequestration sites or the carbon dioxide and associated constituents injected into those sites.</p>

                  <p>(a) No mining operation or operation by which solid minerals are intended to be extracted from the earth shall be commenced after the effective date of the act, except in accordance with its requirements. It is recognized these measures are performed in the public interest and constitute an expense to the operator, and while this act applies to all mining operations, no operator shall be compelled to perform at his own expense measures required under this act with respect to operations that were completed or substantially completed prior to the effective date of this act. Nothing in this act shall provide the land quality division regulatory authority over oil mining operations as defined in W.S. 30-5-104(d)(ii)(F).</p>
                  <p>(b) All surface or underground mining operations operating at the date of enactment of this statute shall have a period of one (1) year within which to fulfill the requirements of this act. This period may be extended at the discretion of the council if the administrator has been unable to review and evaluate all operations that are presently operating under a permit issued by the state land commissioner in compliance with the "Open Cut Land Reclamation Act of 1969".</p>
                  <p>(c) An operator presently operating under a permit issued by the state land commissioner in accordance and in full compliance with the Open Cut Land Reclamation Act of 1969 will be issued a permit upon submission to the administrator of:</p>
                  <p>(i) The information, maps and other exhibits required by this act; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) A reclamation plan which fulfills all of the requirements of this act and is reviewed by the advisory board.</p>
                  <p>(d) Within two (2) months following the final approval of a state program pursuant to Section 503 of P.L. § 95-87, all operators of surface coal mining operations operating under a permit issued in accordance with the terms of this act shall apply for a new mining permit covering those lands expected to be mined or reclaimed after eight (8) months from state program approval. Within eight (8) months from the date of state program approval, the administrator shall approve or deny an application for a surface coal mining permit. No person shall engage in or carry out surface coal mining operations unless the person has first obtained a permit pursuant to this section except as hereafter provided. A person conducting operations consistent with this act may continue operating beyond eight (8) months from state program approval if an application for a permit has been filed in accordance with this act but the administrator's decision on the application has not been rendered.</p>
                  <p>(e) The provisions of this article shall not apply to any of the following activities:</p>
                  <p>(i) Building or expansion of utilities, soil conservation conveyances and foundation excavations for the purpose of constructing buildings and other structures not used in mining operations;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Excavations other than for the extraction of coal by an agency of federal, state or local government or its authorized contractors for highway and railroad cuts and for the purpose of providing fill, sand, gravel and other materials for use in connection with any public project if reclamation requirements of federal, state or local governments are consistent with all provisions of this act or regulations promulgated thereunder. Excavations for the extraction of coal as an incidental part of federal, state or local government financed highway or other construction shall be conducted in accordance with regulations established by the council;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The extraction of sand, gravel, dirt, scoria, limestone, dolomite, shale, ballast or feldspar by a landowner for his own noncommercial use from land owned or leased by him;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Archaeological excavations;</p>
                  <p>(v) Other surface mining operations which the administrator determines to be of an infrequent nature and which involve only minor surface disturbances;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Limited mining operations, whether commercial or noncommercial, for the removal of sand, gravel, scoria, limestone, dolomite, shale, ballast or feldspar from an area of fifteen (15) acres or less of affected land, excluding roads used to access the mining operation, if the operator has written permission for the operation from the owner and lessee, if any, of the surface. The operator shall notify the land quality division of the department of environmental quality and the inspector of mines within the department of workforce services of the location of the land to be mined and the postal address of the operator at least thirty (30) days before commencing operations. A copy of the notice shall also be mailed to all surface owners located within one (1) mile of the proposed boundary of the limited mining operation at least thirty (30) days before commencing operations. The operator shall notify the land quality division of the department of environmental quality of the date of commencement of limited mining operations within thirty (30) days of commencing operations. Limited mining operations authorized under this paragraph are subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) That the affected lands shall not be within three hundred (300) feet of any existing occupied dwelling, home, public building, school, church, community or institutional building, park or cemetery unless the landowner's consent has been obtained;</p>
                  <p>(B) Before commencing any limited mining operations, the operator shall file a bond to insure reclamation in accordance with the purposes of this act in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per acre, except for quarries for which the bond amount shall not exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre of affected land including roads used to access the mining operation. Within ninety (90) days after limited mining operations commence, the administrator may require the operator to post an additional bond per acre of affected land if he determines that such amount is necessary to insure reclamation. The operator shall post the additional bond not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification;</p>
                  <p>(C) After the limited mining operations have ceased, the operator shall notify the administrator of such fact in the operator's next annual report and commence reclamation and restoration in compliance with the rules and regulations of the land quality division of the department of environmental quality. The rules and regulations for reclamation shall at all times be reasonable;</p>
                  <p>(D) Immediate reclamation will not be required if the landowner advises the department in writing of his intent to further utilize the product of the mine, and if he assumes the obligation of reclamation;</p>
                  <p>(E) The limited mining operations shall be terminated if the operator does not commence operations within five (5) years as noted in the annual report following notification to the land quality division of the department of environmental quality under this paragraph;</p>
                  <p>(F) Limited mining operations may continue for not more than five (5) years from the date of commencing operations unless a notification to extend operations is submitted to the land quality division administrator. Operators shall submit a notification of extension for every subsequent five (5) year period with the annual report.</p>

                  <p>(f) In promulgating regulations to implement this section the administrator and director shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) The nature of the class, type, or types of activities involved;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Their magnitude (in tons and acres);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Their potential for adverse environmental impact; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Whether the class, type, or types of activities are already subject to an existing regulatory system by state or local government or an agency of the federal government.</p>
                  <p>(g) A single permit may be issued to all county or other local governmental entities of the state to operate noncontiguous facilities in compliance with the statutes.</p>
                  <p>(h) A single permit may be issued for mining of noncontiguous minerals deposits at the discretion of the administrator in compliance with the statutes.</p>
                  <p>(j) The council, upon recommendation from the advisory board through the administrator and director, may modify or suspend certain requirements of W.S. 35-11-406(a), (b), (d), (f) and (g) by rules and regulations, for surface mining operations involving not more than thirty-five thousand (35,000) yards of overburden, excluding topsoil, and ten (10) acres of affected land in any one (1) year, if the application requirements insure reclamation in accordance with the purposes of this act. Roads used to access a mining operation permitted under this section shall be excluded from the annual ten (10) acres of affected land limit, but shall be included in the permit and bonded for reclamation liability.</p>
                  <p>(k) An operator conducting operations pursuant to W.S. 35-11-401(e)(vi) shall file an annual report with the administrator on or within thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary date of the commencement date of initial operation. The report shall contain:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and address of the operator;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The location of the mining operations;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The number of acres of affected lands at the conclusion of the past year's operation;</p>

                  <p>(a) The council shall, upon recommendation by the advisory board through the administrator and the director, establish rules and regulations pursuant to the following reclamation standards for the affected areas, including but not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(i) The highest previous use of the affected lands, the surrounding terrain and natural vegetation, surface and subsurface flowing or stationary water bodies, wildlife and aquatic habitat and resources, and acceptable uses after reclamation including the utility and capacity of the reclaimed lands to support such uses;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Backfilling, regrading or recontouring to assure the reclamation of the land to a use at least equal to its highest previous use;</p>
                  <p>(iii) A time schedule encouraging the earliest possible reclamation program consistent with the orderly and economic development of the mining property;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Revegetation of affected lands including species to be used, methods of planting and other details necessary to assure the development of a vegetative cover consistent with the surrounding terrain and the highest prior use standards set out in paragraph (i) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(v) Stockpiling, preservation and reuse of topsoil for revegetation, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the administrator that other methods of reclamation or types of soil are superior;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Prevention of pollution of waters of the state from mining operations, substantial erosion, sedimentation, landslides, accumulation and discharge of acid water, and flooding, both during and after mining and reclamation;</p>
                  <p>(vii) In administering established rules and regulations on such standards the administrator shall consider all the facts and circumstances bearing upon any reclamation plan. In consideration of reclamation plans for any mining operation that is presently being conducted in the state under a permit issued by the state land commission under the "Open Cut Land Reclamation Act of 1969", particular attention shall be paid to:</p>
                  <p>(A) The social and economic value of the product mined;</p>
                  <p>(B) The technological availability for economic feasibility of reclaiming the affected area.</p>
                  <p>(viii) Establishing methods of estimating cost of reclamation which shall be computed according to established engineering methods;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Establishing procedures to obtain special license to explore by dozing. Such procedures will include but not be limited to method of application, location of proposed exploration, present use of affected lands, name of surface owner, proposed reclamation program, bonding requirement, and such other procedures as are necessary to insure that the exploration work will be conducted within the intent of this act;</p>
                  <p>(x) Rules and regulations for the criteria for review and information and public notice requirements for permit revisions. A permit may be revised without public notice or hearing for revisions, including incidental boundary revisions to the area covered by the permit, if these do not propose significant alterations in the reclamation plan. Subject to applicable standards, any permit, except for surface coal mining permits, may be revised, in the permitted area, by identifying proposed alterations to the mining or reclamation plan in the annual report or addendum thereto, or by obtaining prior approval from the director, at the operator's discretion;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Rules and regulations for conducting coal exploration operations which shall include prior notice of intention to explore, written approval by the director for the removal of more than two hundred fifty (250) tons of coal and reclamation provisions for new and existing operations in accordance with the reclamation standards governing surface mining;</p>
                  <p>(xii) Rules and regulations governing new and existing special bituminous surface coal mines as recognized in P.L. 95-87, which shall be controlling notwithstanding other provisions of this act to the contrary. The regulations shall pertain only to standards governing on site handling of spoils, elimination of depressions capable of collecting water, creation of impoundments and regrading to the approximate original contour, and shall specify that all remaining highwalls be stable. All other performance standards contained in this act shall apply to such mines;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) Rules and regulations governing the use of decommissioned wind turbine blades and towers to backfill surface coal mining sites as part of an approved reclamation plan. Rules promulgated under this paragraph shall, at a minimum, provide for:</p>
                  <p>(A) Minimum depth requirements for the burial of decommissioned wind turbine blades and towers to be buried below the surface and above any aquifers as defined in W.S. 35-11- 103(h)(i).

                  <p>(b) To the extent federal law or regulations require approval by state wildlife agencies regarding surface mining lands to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat, the Wyoming game and fish department shall consider fish and wildlife habitat to mean as defined in W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxvi) and does not include grazingland as defined in W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxvii), unless the grazingland has been designated as:</p>
                  <p>(i) Critical habitat by the United States fish and wildlife service; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Crucial habitat by the Wyoming game and fish department prior to submittal of the initial permit application or any subsequent amendments to the permit application.</p>
                  <p>(c) For the reclamation of grazingland, native shrubs shall be used for reestablishment. No shrub species shall be required to be more than one-half (1/2) of the shrubs in the post-mining standard.</p>

                  <p>(a) All drill holes sunk in the exploration for locatable or leasable minerals on all lands within the state of Wyoming shall be capped, sealed or plugged in the manner described hereinafter by or on behalf of the discoverer, locator or owner who drilled the hole. Prospecting and exploration drill holes shall include all drill holes except those drilled in conjunction with the expansion of an existing mine operation or wells or holes regulated pursuant to W.S. 30-5-101 through 30-5-204.</p>
                  <p>(b) "Person" means any person, firm, association or corporation who drills or is responsible for drilling holes for the purpose of exploration or development of these minerals.</p>
                  <p>(c) "Plugging, sealing and capping upon abandonment" means any hole drilled shall be abandoned in the following manner:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Plugging". All artesian flow of ground water to surface shall be eliminated by a cement plug or other similar material sufficient to prevent such artesian flow;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Sealing". Drill holes which have encountered any ground water shall be sealed by leaving a column of drilling mud in the hole or by such other sealing procedure which is adequate to prevent fluid communication between aquifers;</p>
                  <p>(iii) "Surface Cap". Each drill hole is to be completely filled to the collar of the hole or securely capped at a minimum depth of two (2) feet below either the original land surface or the collar of the hole, whichever is at the lower elevation. If capped, the cap is to be made of concrete or other material satisfactory for such capping. The hole shall be backfilled above the cap to the original land surface;</p>
                  <p>(iv) "Water Well". If any holes drilled are to be ultimately used as or converted to water wells, the user shall comply with the applicable provisions of W.S. 41-3-911 through 41-3-938;</p>

                  <p>(d) Within sixty (60) days after the completion and abandonment of any hole drilled which has artesian flow at the surface, the person for whom the hole was drilled shall report the existence of the hole to the administrator, land quality division and the state engineer. The report, set forth in affidavit form, shall contain at least the location of the hole to the nearest two hundred (200) feet, the depth of the hole and estimated rate of flow, if known, and the facts of the plugging technique used.</p>
                  <p>(e) Within twelve (12) months after the completion and proper abandonment of any hole drilled any person shall file with the administrator, land quality division and the state engineer a report which shall include the location of each hole, utilizing Wyoming state plane coordinates, and the depth of each hole drilled. The reports shall be confidential for a period of five (5) years from the date of filing. The period may be extended for additional five (5) year periods upon request of the person filing the report. When a report is no longer confidential pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of W.S. 35-11-1101 shall apply.</p>
                  <p>(f) Where plugging reports are required to conform with federal regulations, and if such reports cover all the requirements of this section, they are adequate for the purposes described herein.</p>
                  <p>(g) Except for drilling in conjunction with coal mining or coal exploration operations, the director in consultation with the administrator, land quality division, may waive any of the administrative provisions of this act pertaining to aquifers following a formal written application for a waiver of any particular provisions, if in the opinion of the director waiver of any such provisions shall not adversely affect the interests of the state of Wyoming and would create an undue hardship upon application. Waivers shall be in writing and may be appealed under the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(h) The drill hole should be capped immediately following the drilling and probing. If it is necessary to temporarily delay the capping or keep the hole open for any reason, the drill hole must be securely covered in a manner which will prevent injury to persons or animals.</p>
                  <p>(j) Before drilling on lands within the state of Wyoming, any person conducting coal exploration operations shall give notice to the administrator which shall, at a minimum include a legal description of the area, the approximate number of holes to be drilled and a reclamation plan for proper abandonment in accordance with regulations promulgated by the council. This excludes drilling within an existing permit area approved prior to August 3, 1977.</p>
                  <p>(k) Except as follows, any person who fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment in a county jail for not more than ninety (90) days or a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), or both. Any person who drills in conjunction with coal mining or coal exploration operations in violation of this section or regulations promulgated pursuant hereto is subject to the provisions of W.S. 35-11-901.</p>
                  <p>(m) When exploratory drill holes have been abandoned in violation of these provisions, the director in consultation with the administrator, land quality division may then cause such holes to be capped, sealed or plugged and the state of Wyoming is granted a cause of action against the person refusing to comply with the provisions of this section for the recovery of the reasonable costs incurred by the director in having the holes properly capped, sealed or plugged.</p>
                  <p>(n) All actions pursuant to subsection (k) or (m) of this section, must be initiated by the state of Wyoming within three (3) years of the date of the report required by subsection (d) of this section.</p>

All reasons for deficiency or denial shall be stated in writing to the applicant. All items not specified as being deficient at the end of the first one hundred fifty (150) day period shall be deemed complete for the purposes of this subsection. After this period, for noncoal permits, the administrator shall not raise any item not previously specified as being deficient unless the applicant in subsequent revisions significantly modifies the application. If the applicant submits additional information in response to any deficiency notice, the administrator shall review such additional information within thirty (30) days of submission and advise the applicant in writing if the application is suitable for publication under subsection (j) of this section, that the application is still deficient or that the application is denied.</p>
                  <p>(j) The applicant shall cause notice of the application to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the proposed mining site once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks commencing within fifteen (15) days after being notified by the administrator.

                  <p>(iv) The proposed mining operation would irreparably harm, destroy, or materially impair any area that has been designated by the council a rare or uncommon area and having particular historical, archaeological, wildlife, surface geological, botanical or scenic value;</p>
                  <p>(v) If the proposed mining operation will cause pollution of any waters in violation of the laws of this state or of the federal government;</p>
                  <p>(vi) If the applicant has had any other permit or license issued hereunder revoked, or any bond posted to comply with this act forfeited;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The proposed operation constitutes a public nuisance or endangers the public health and safety;</p>
                  <p>(viii) The affected land lies within three hundred (300) feet of any existing occupied dwelling, home, public building, school, church, community or institutional building, park or cemetery, unless the landowner's consent has been obtained. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to operations conducted under an approved permit issued by the state land commissioner in compliance with the "Open Cut Land Reclamation Act of 1969";</p>
                  <p>(ix) The operator is unable to produce the bonds required;</p>
                  <p>(x) Repealed by Laws 2020, ch. 35, § 2.</p>

                  <p>(xv) If the applicant has been and continues to be in violation of the provisions of this act;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) No permit shall be denied on the basis that the applicant has been in actual violation of the provisions of this act if the violation has been corrected or discontinued.</p>
                  <p>(n) The applicant for a surface coal mining permit has the burden of establishing that his application is in compliance with this act and all applicable state laws. No surface coal mining permit shall be approved unless the applicant affirmatively demonstrates and the administrator finds in writing:</p>
                  <p>(i) The application is accurate and complete;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The reclamation plan can accomplish reclamation as required by this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The proposed operation has been designed to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The area proposed to be mined is not included within an area designated unsuitable for surface coal mining pursuant to W.S. 35-11-425, within an area where mining is prohibited pursuant to section 522(e) of P.L. 95-87, or within an area under review for this designation under an administrative proceeding, unless in such an area as to which an administrative proceeding has commenced pursuant to W.S. 35-11-425, the operator making the permit application demonstrates that, prior to January 1, 1977, he has made substantial legal and financial commitments in relation to the operation for which he is applying for a permit;</p>
                  <p>(v) The proposed operation would:</p>
                  <p>(A) Not interrupt, discontinue, or preclude farming on alluvial valley floors that are irrigated or naturally subirrigated, but, excluding undeveloped range lands which are not significant to farming on said alluvial valley floors and those lands as to which the administrator finds that if the farming that will be interrupted, discontinued or precluded is of such small acreage as to be of negligible impact on the farm's agricultural production; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Not materially damage the quantity or quality of water in surface or underground water systems that supply these alluvial valley floors. Paragraph (n)(v) of this section shall not affect those surface coal mining operations which in the year preceding August 3, 1977, produced coal in commercial quantities, and were located within or adjacent to alluvial valley floors or had obtained specific permit approval by the administrator to conduct surface coal mining operations within said alluvial valley floors. If coal deposits are precluded from being mined by this paragraph, the administrator shall certify to the secretary of the interior that the coal owner or lessee may be eligible for participation in a coal exchange program pursuant to section 510(b)(5) of P.L. 95-87.</p>
                  <p>(vi) If the area proposed to be surface coal mined contains prime farmland, the operator has the technological capability to restore such mined area, within a reasonable time, to equivalent or higher levels of yield as nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding area under equivalent levels of management and can meet the soil reconstruction standards of this act and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto;</p>
                  <p>(vii) The schedule provided in paragraph (a)(xiv) of this section indicates that all surface coal mining operations owned or controlled by the applicant are currently in compliance with this act and all laws referred to in paragraph (a)(xiv) of this section or that any violation has been or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the authority, department or agency which has jurisdiction over the violation.</p>
                  <p>(o) No permit shall be issued to an applicant after a finding by the director or council, after opportunity for hearing, that the applicant or operator specified in the application controls or has controlled mining operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations of such nature and duration with such resulting irreparable harm to the environment as to indicate reckless, knowing or intentional conduct.</p>
                  <p>(p) The following objection procedure shall apply to applications for mining permits for coal:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any interested person has the right to file written objections to the application with the director within thirty (30) days after the last publication of the notice required in subsection (j) of this section. The director shall within five (5) business days forward any objection to the applicant and shall make objections available to the public;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If an informal conference is requested by the applicant or objector, the director shall hold the informal conference in the locality of the proposed operation within thirty (30) days after the final date for filing objections under paragraph (i) of this subsection unless a different period is stipulated to by the parties. The director shall publish notice of the time, date and location of the informal conference in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the proposed operation at least two (2) weeks before the date of the informal conference;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The director shall render a decision on the application within thirty (30) days after the deadline to file objections provided in paragraph (i) of this subsection if no informal conference is requested. If the director holds an informal conference, all parties to the conference shall be furnished with a copy of the final written decision of the director issuing or denying the permit within sixty (60) days of the conference. The applicant or objector may appeal the director's written decision after an informal conference to the council. If a hearing is held, the hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and the council shall issue findings of fact and a decision on the application within sixty (60) days after the final hearing;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Notwithstanding W.S. 35-11-1001, only the applicant or an objector who participated in a hearing before the council may obtain judicial review of the council's decision.</p>
                  <p>(q) The following objection procedure shall apply for any other mining permit application:</p>
                  <p>(i) Any interested person has the right to file written objections to the administrator within thirty (30) days after the last publication of the notice required in subsection</p>
                  <p>(j) of this section. The administrator shall within five (5) business days forward any objection to the applicant and shall make objections available to the public;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The administrator shall review all objections and shall forward a report and recommendations on the objections to the director. The director shall issue to the applicant and to any objector a final written decision issuing or denying the permit within thirty (30) days after the deadline to file objections provided in paragraph (i) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The applicant or objector may appeal the director's written decision to the council. If a hearing is held, the council shall issue findings of fact and a decision within sixty (60) days after the final hearing;</p>

                  <p>(a) The director shall revoke a mining permit if at any time he determines that the permit holder intentionally misstated or failed to provide any fact that would have resulted in the denial of a mining permit and which good faith compliance with the policies, purposes, and provisions of this act would have required him to provide.</p>
                  <p>(b) Unless an emergency exists, and except as otherwise provided in this act, the revocation of a permit shall become effective upon thirty (30) days' notice to the operator. In an emergency, a special meeting of the council may cause a revocation to become effective upon receipt of notice by the permit holder.</p>
                  <p>(c) When an inspection carried out pursuant to the enforcement of this act reveals that a pattern of violations by any surface coal mine operator of any requirements of this act or any permit conditions required by this act has existed, and that these violations were caused by the unwarranted failure of the operator to comply with these requirements or permit conditions, or that these violations are willfully caused by the operator, the director shall issue an order to the operator to show cause why the permit should not be suspended or revoked. Opportunity for a public hearing before the council shall be provided. If a hearing is requested the director shall inform all interested parties of the time and place of the hearing. Upon failure of the operator to show cause why the permit should not be suspended or revoked, the council shall suspend or revoke the permit.</p>

                  <p>(d) Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the annual report, inspection report and other required materials, if the administrator finds the annual report in order and consistent with the reclamation plan as set forth in the permit, or as amended to adjust to conditions encountered during mining and reclamation operations as provided by law, the director shall determine the size of the bond to be posted for the purpose of insuring reclamation of the lands affected during the ensuing year.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person desiring to engage in mineral exploration by dozing shall apply to the administrator for a special license. The application shall be in accordance with rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the standards set forth in subsection (b) of this section, by the council upon recommendation by the director after consultation with the administrator and advisory board, and shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) The council shall establish rules and regulations pursuant to the following reclamation standards for exploration by dozing:</p>
                  <p>(i) Backfilling the topsoil disturbed by dozing to its approximate original contour;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Revegetation of the land affected by dozing, including species to be used;</p>

                  <p>(c) After reviewing the application for special license to explore by dozing the administrator shall set the amount of the bond necessary to insure complete reclamation and issue the special license to explore.</p>
                  <p>(d) The administrator may deny the special license to explore if he believes the application is in violation of the purpose of this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) The decision of the administrator may be appealed through the director to the council.</p>
                  <p>(f) All special licenses to explore issued by the administrator shall be reviewed by the council at their next regularly scheduled meeting.</p>
                  <p>(g) A bond posted under the terms of this section shall be released upon completion of the exploration, by dozing, the reclamation program, and an inspection by the administrator. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section will result in forfeiture of the bond.</p>

                  <p>(a) Every operator to whom any permit or license is issued shall comply with all requirements of this act, the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, and reclamation plans and other terms and conditions of any permit or license.</p>
                  <p>(b) The operator, pursuant to an approved surface mining permit and mining plan and reclamation plan, or any approved revisions thereto, shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Conspicuously post and maintain at each entrance to the operation, a sign which clearly shows the name, address and telephone number of the operator, the name of his local authorized agent, and the permit number of his operation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Conduct all surface mining and reclamation activities within the permit area in conformity with his approved plan;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Protect the removed and segregated topsoil from wind and water erosion, and from acid or toxic materials, and preserve such in a usable condition for sustaining vegetation when restored in reclamation, or if topsoil is virtually nonexistent or is not capable of sustaining vegetation, then subsoil, which is available and suitable, shall be removed, segregated, and preserved in a like manner as may be required in the approved reclamation plan;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Cover, bury, impound, contain or otherwise dispose of toxic acid forming, or radioactive material or any material determined by the administrator to be hazardous to health and safety, or which constitutes a threat of pollution to surface or subsurface water as may be required in the approved reclamation plan;</p>
                  <p>(v) Conduct contouring operations to return the land to the use set out in the reclamation plan;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Backfill or grade, and replace topsoil, or approved subsoil, which has been segregated and preserved as may be required in the approved reclamation plan;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Replace, as nearly as possible, native or superior self regenerating vegetation on land affected, as may be required in the approved reclamation plan;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Prevent, throughout the mining and reclamation operation, and for a period of five (5) years after the operation has been terminated, pollution of surface and subsurface waters on the land affected by the institution of plantings and revegetation, the construction of drainage systems and treatment facilities including settling ponds and the casing, sealing of boreholes, shafts, and wells so that no pollution is allowed to drain untreated into surface or subsurface water in accordance with state or federal water quality standards, whichever are higher, as may be required in the approved reclamation plan;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Reclaim the affected land as mining progresses in conformity with the approved reclamation plan;</p>
                  <p>(x) For surface coal mining operations, preserve throughout the mining and reclamation process the essential hydrologic functions of alluvial valley floors if these areas are classified within a permit. This paragraph does not alter the authority granted under any other section of this act with respect to requirements for preserving throughout the mining and reclamation process the essential hydrologic functions of the minesite, or associated offsite areas, of other mining operations;</p>
                  <p>(xi) For surface coal mining operations, insure that explosives are used only in accordance with existing state and federal law and the rules and regulations promulgated by the council, which shall include but are not limited to provisions to:</p>
                  <p>(A) Provide adequate advance written notice to local governments and residents who might be affected by the use of these explosives by publication of the planned blasting schedule in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality and by mailing a copy of the proposed blasting schedule to every resident within one-half (1/2) mile of the proposed blasting site and by providing daily notice to the resident or occupiers in these areas prior to any blasting;</p>
                  <p>(B) Maintain for a period of at least three (3) years and make available for public inspection upon request a log detailing the location of the blasts, the pattern and depth of the drill holes, the amount of explosives used per hole, and the order and length of delay in the blast;</p>
                  <p>(C) Limit the types of explosives and detonating equipment, the size, timing and frequency of blasts based upon the physical conditions of the site so as to prevent:</p>
                  <p>(I) Injury to persons;</p>
                  <p>(II) Damage to public and private property outside the permit area;</p>
                  <p>(III) Adverse impacts on any underground mine;</p>
                  <p>(IV) A change in the course, channel or availability of ground or surface water outside the permit area.</p>
                  <p>(D) Require that all blasting operations be conducted by trained and competent persons as certified by the administrator;</p>
                  <p>(E) Provide that upon the request of a resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half (1/2) mile of any portion of the permitted area the applicant or permittee shall conduct a preblasting survey of these structures and submit the survey to the administrator and a copy to the resident or owner making the request. The area of the survey shall be decided by the administrator and shall include provisions as the United States secretary of the interior shall promulgate.</p>
                  <p>(xii) For surface coal mining operations, replace in accordance with state law the water supply of an owner of interest in real property who obtains all or part of his supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial or other legitimate use from an underground or surface source where the supply has been affected by contamination, diminution or interruption proximately resulting from the surface coal mine operation.</p>

                  <p>(a) In those instances in which the surface owner is not the owner of the mineral estate proposed to be mined by mining operations a permit shall not be issued without the execution of a bond or undertaking to the state, whichever is applicable, for the use and benefit of the surface owner or owners of the land, in an amount sufficient to secure the payment for any damages to the surface estate, to the crops and forage, or to the tangible improvements of the surface owner. This amount shall be determined by the administrator and shall be commensurate with the reasonable value of the surrounding land, and the effect of the overall operation of the landowner. This bond is in addition to the performance bond required for reclamation by this act. As damage is determined it shall be paid. Financial loss resulting from disruption of the surface owner's operation shall be considered as part of the damage. A bond for surface damage shall not be required when the agreement negotiated between the surface owner and the mineral owner or developer waives any requirement therefor. Payment of damages shall be paid annually unless otherwise agreed to by the surface owner and the operator.</p>
                  <p>(b) An owner of real property and who holds a valid adjudicated water right and who obtains all or part of his supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, or other legitimate use from a surface or an underground source other than a subterranean stream having a permanent distinct known channel may maintain an action against an operator to recover damages for pollution, diminution, or interruption of such water supply resulting from surface, in situ mining or underground mining.</p>

                  <p>(a) The purpose of any bond required to be filed with the administrator by the operator shall be to assure that the operator shall faithfully perform all requirements of this act and comply with all rules and regulations of the board made in accordance with the provisions of this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) All bonds shall be signed by the operator as principal, by a good and sufficient corporate surety licensed to do business in the state, and be made payable to the state of Wyoming. At the discretion of the director, the record mineral owner of the land to be mined may also be required to join as principal. This subsection shall not apply to collateral bonds issued pursuant to subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) The amount of any bond to be filed with the administrator prior to commencing any mining shall be:</p>
                  <p>(i) For an initial bond the amount equal to the estimated cost of reclaiming the affected land disturbed and restoring, as defined in W.S. 35-11-103(f)(iii), any groundwater disturbed by in situ mining during the first year of operation under each permit. The estimated cost shall be based on the operator's cost estimate submitted with the permit plus the administrator's estimate of the additional cost to the state of bringing in personnel and equipment should the operator fail or the site be abandoned. In no event shall the bond be less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), except for limited mining operations authorized and bonded under W.S. 35-11-401(e) or any noncoal mine the affected land of which, excluding roads, is ten (10) acres or less, in which case the bond amount shall be set by the administrator with approval of the director to cover the cost of reclamation, and in no event less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per acre, for affected land;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For renewal bonds the amount equal to the estimated cost of reclaiming the land to be disturbed during that renewal period, and the estimated cost of completing reclamation of unreleased lands and groundwater disturbed during prior periods of time. The estimated cost shall be based on the operator's cost estimate, which shall include any changes in the actual or estimated cost of reclamation of unreleased affected lands, plus the administrator's estimate of the additional cost to the state of bringing in personnel and equipment should the operator fail or the site be abandoned. In no event shall the bond be less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), except for limited mining operations authorized and bonded under W.S. 35-11-401(e) or any noncoal mine the affected land of which, excluding roads, is ten (10) acres or less, in which case the bond amount shall be set by the administrator with approval of the director to cover the cost of reclamation, and in no event less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per acre, for affected land.</p>
                  <p>(d) The council may promulgate rules and regulations for a self-bonding program for mining operations under which the administrator may accept the bond of the operator itself without separate surety when the operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director the existence of a suitable agent to receive service of process and a history of financial solvency and continuous operation sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond this amount. This subsection shall not become operative until the council has promulgated rules and regulations for the self-bonding program which require that the protection provided by self-bonding shall be consistent with the objectives and purposes of this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) When the reclamation plan for any affected land has been completed, the administrator may recommend to the director the release of up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the bond required for that affected land. The remaining portion of the bond shall be not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), and shall be held for a period of at least five (5) years after the date of reduction to assure proper revegetation and restoration of groundwater. The retained portion of the bond may be returned to the operator at an earlier date if a release signed by the surface owner and approved by the administrator and director is obtained.</p>
                  <p>(f) If the area of land or groundwater under permit to be disturbed is increased, then the amount of bond shall be increased to cover the added cost of reclaiming all affected lands or groundwater.</p>
                  <p>(g) The council may, consistent with the requirements of 30 CFR 800.21(c), promulgate rules and regulations that allow the administrator to accept real property posted as a collateral bond without separate surety, provided that the real property is located in this state, the bond provides a perfected first lien security interest in the real property in favor of the department and the protection provided by the bond is consistent with the objectives and purposes of this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected may petition the council to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations, or to have a designation terminated. The petition shall contain allegations of facts with supporting evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. Within ten (10) months after receipt of the petition the council shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the affected area, after appropriate notice and publication of the date, time and location of the hearing. After having filed a petition and before the hearing, any person may intervene by filing allegations of facts with supporting evidence which would tend to establish the allegations. Within sixty (60) days after the hearing, the council shall issue and furnish to the petitioner and any other party to the hearing, a written decision with reasons regarding the petition. The hearing need not be held if all petitioners reach agreement prior to the requested hearing and withdraw their request.</p>
                  <p>(b) If petitioned, the council will review the particular area and:</p>
                  <p>(i) Shall designate it as an area unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations if it is determined that reclamation pursuant to the requirements of this act is not technologically and economically feasible; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) May designate it as an area unsuitable for surface coal mining if the coal mining operation will:</p>
                  <p>(A) Be incompatible with existing state or local land use plans or programs; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Affect fragile or historic lands in which these operations could result in significant damage to important historic, cultural, scientific and esthetic values and natural systems; or</p>
                  <p>(C) Affect renewable resource lands in which these operations could result in a substantial loss or reduction of long-range productivity of water supply or of food or fiber products, and these lands to include aquifers and aquifer recharge areas; or</p>
                  <p>(D) Affect natural hazard lands in which these operations could substantially endanger life and property; these lands to include areas subject to frequent flooding and areas of unstable geology.</p>
                  <p>(c) Prior to designating any land areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations, the administrator shall prepare a detailed statement on:</p>
                  <p>(i) The potential coal resources of the area;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The demand for coal resources; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The impact of this designation on the environment, economy and supply of coal.</p>
                  <p>(d) The above process will include proper notice, opportunities for public and agency participation including land use planning bodies and a public hearing prior to designation or redesignation, pursuant to this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any designation shall not prevent the mineral exploration pursuant to this act of any area so designated.</p>
                  <p>(f) The requirements of this section shall not apply to lands on which surface coal mining operations were being conducted on August 3, 1977 or under a permit issued pursuant to this act, or where substantial legal and financial commitments in these operations were in existence prior to January 4, 1977.</p>
                  <p>(g) This section shall not become effective until approval of a state program pursuant to P.L. 95-87.</p>
                  <p>(h) This section shall operate independently of all other sections of the act except as to the application of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

                  <p>(iii) Within ten (10) months after the effective date of this act the council shall adopt rules and regulations to implement this act and shall provide such reasonable time as may be necessary, but in no event to exceed twenty-four (24) months after the effective date of this act, for owners and operators of solid waste management facilities to comply with the rules, regulations, standards or permits;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Shall establish categories of solid waste management facilities based on waste type, volume, facility ownership, facility operation or other facility characteristics. Standards and requirements for each category may vary as are necessary to promote the purposes of this act;</p>
                  <p>(v) Shall provide for consistency and equivalency with rules and regulations adopted by the United States environmental protection agency under authority of Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, P.L. 94-580, as amended, for those facilities subject to such federal requirements, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The director after consultation with the administrator may petition the council to promulgate rules and regulations more stringent than federal rules if adequate cause exists to determine that circumstances specific to the state compel adoption of more stringent rules to adequately protect the public health and environment of the state;</p>
                  <p>(B) The imposition of the rules under this paragraph is consistent and equivalent with the imposition of rules by the United States environmental protection agency, except that the director after consultation with the administrator may petition the council to determine for individual permits or orders that adequate cause exists for permit conditions or orders more stringent than federal regulations;</p>
                  <p>(C) Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the promulgation of rules which are not otherwise authorized in this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) To the extent not already provided by subsection (a) of this section and W.S. 35-11-504 and notwithstanding W.S. 35-11-424, the director shall, pursuant to this section or by rule, require applicants for commercial radioactive waste management facility permits to do the following:</p>

                  <p>(ii) No less than ten (10) months prior to submission of an application for a commercial radioactive waste management facility permit, submit a notice of intent to file a permit application and a nonrefundable regulatory agency support fee in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00);</p>
                  <p>(iii) Upon receipt of a permit and the filing of each annual report thereunder, pay an annual inspection and monitoring fee to be determined by the director, based upon the estimated costs of inspecting the facility and monitoring compliance with the permit terms. Unused funds shall be credited against the next annual inspection and monitoring fee;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Upon receipt of a permit, establish a long term remediation and monitoring trust for the benefit of the department in an amount sufficient to conduct perpetual monitoring and maintenance of the permitted facility and to remediate the release of any waste or waste constituent in violation of the approved post-closure plan. The long term remediation and monitoring trust may be initially funded by a letter of credit, cash or sufficient bond excepting self-bonds. The letter of credit, cash or bond shall be reduced by an amount equal to the per ton fee levied and paid to the trust during the prior year, provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) Facilities or portions thereof which the United States government is required by law to accept ownership and assume responsibility for perpetual monitoring, maintenance, and remediation shall not be required to establish a long term remediation and monitoring trust;</p>
                  <p>(B) Monies actually paid into the long term remediation and monitoring trust on a per ton basis shall be a credit against funds otherwise payable pursuant to W.S. 35-12-113(g)(i); and</p>
                  <p>(C) All expenses incurred by the department to conduct perpetual monitoring and maintenance of the permitted facility shall be paid by the permittee.

                  <p>(v) Reduce, to the extent determined by the director to be technically and economically reasonable, the toxicity of any waste managed at the facility; and</p>
                  <p>(vi) Follow post-closure land uses established for the facility by the director.</p>
                  <p>(c) Unless and until the council adopts rules pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, for commercial radioactive waste management facilities or a particular classification of commercial radioactive waste management facilities, the director shall rely upon the performance criteria and standards of title 10, part 40, appendix A, and title 40, part 192, subpart D of the Code of Federal Regulations, as of January 1, 1991, as guidance for determining whether an application complies with the act. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the director's authority to impose permit requirements or conditions or the council's authority to promulgate rules, consistent with this act, which are more stringent than the federal regulations referenced.</p>
                  <p>(d) The council shall, upon recommendation from the director and the administrators of the air, water and solid and hazardous waste divisions, promulgate rules and regulations which are:</p>
                  <p>(i) Necessary for the state to obtain authorization of its hazardous waste management regulatory program to operate in lieu of the federal hazardous waste program administered under subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, P.L. 94-580, as amended, provided that the council may not adopt rules requiring imposition of administrative penalties for hazardous waste violations; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Subject to the limitations on stringency of paragraph (a)(v) of this section, consistent with, and equivalent to rules and regulations adopted by the United States environmental protection agency under authority of subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, P.L. 94-580, as amended.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Expend funds from the account under W.S. 35-11-424 to remedy and abate any immediate danger to human health, safety and welfare.</p>
                  <p>(k) If the forfeited bond or other financial assurance instrument is inadequate to cover the costs to carry out the activities specified in subsection (a) of this section, or in any case where the department has expended account monies under subsection (j) of this section, the attorney general shall bring suit to recover the cost of performing the activities where recovery is deemed possible.</p>
                  <p>(m) When the director determines that the violation has been remedied or the damage abated, the director shall release that portion of the bond or financial assurance instrument being held under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section. When the director determines that closure activities have been successfully completed at any solid waste management facility, the director shall release that portion of the bond or financial assurance instrument being held to guarantee performance of activities specified in subparagraphs (a)(i)(A) through (E) of this section. For solid waste management facilities other than landfills for the disposal of municipal wastes, the remaining portion of the bond or financial assurance instrument shall be held for a period of not less than five (5) years after the date of facility closure, or so long thereafter as necessary to assure proper performance of any post-closure activities specified in subparagraph (a)(i)(F) of this section. For municipal solid waste management facilities, the period shall be the minimum necessary to comply with P.L. 94-580. The retained portion of the bond or other financial assurance instrument may be returned to the operator at an earlier date if the director determines that the facility has been adequately stabilized and that environmental monitoring or control systems have demonstrated that the facility closure is protective of public health and the environment consistent with the purposes of this act.</p>
                  <p>(n) No supplemental bond or financial assurance shall be required of any facility, mine, permit or license subject to the bond or financial assurance requirements of article 2, 3 or 4 of this act, to meet the requirements of this section, for any solid waste management facility used solely for the management of wastes generated within the boundary of the permitted facility or mine operation by the facility or mine owner or operator, or from a mine mouth electric power plant or coal drier.</p>

                  <p>(a) In recognition of the need to minimize unnecessary uses of the land for solid waste management, to allow for an effective ability for state oversight, regulation and inspection of solid wastes intended to be managed in the state and to conserve natural resources in accord with the policy and purpose of this act, commercial solid waste management facilities shall conform to the following operating practices:</p>
                  <p>(i) Solid wastes shall be screened by the facility operator in a manner approved by the director to assure to the maximum practical extent that wastes prohibited from disposal at the facility are not managed or disposed of at the facility. Management or disposal of any prohibited waste by a facility shall be cause for the council to issue a cessation order preventing continued receipt of solid wastes at the facility. The order shall remain in effect until the director approves a revised waste screening plan submitted by the facility operator which the director deems sufficient to prevent receipt of wastes prohibited from disposal at the facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Solid wastes shall be processed within the state to facilitate inspections of processing by the department, and removal and recovery of useful components of the waste stream as required by this section, using processes found to be acceptable in rules and regulations promulgated by the council including but not limited to grinding, shredding, incineration or composting;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Rules and regulations of the council shall establish minimum acceptable removal and recovery rates for useful components of the solid waste stream. Such rates may be established for the facility as a whole, or may differ for different components of the solid waste stream;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Following adoption by the council of rules and regulations to implement this section, disposal of useful components of the solid waste stream shall be prohibited at any land disposal facility in the state;</p>
                  <p>(v) Residues remaining following processing, separation and reclamation of useful components of the solid waste stream shall be treated, stored or disposed in compliance with the requirements of this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) For purposes of this section useful components of the solid waste stream include but are not limited to energy, glass, ferrous and nonferrous metals, paper products and organic matter.</p>
                  <p>(c) Compliance with the requirements of this section for commercial solid waste management facilities does not limit any other requirements which may be applicable to such facilities under the act, nor any applicable local rule or ordinance.</p>

The county commissioners shall hold one (1) or more public hearings before making their decision. The county commissioners shall publish notice of each hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the proposed facility once each week for at least two (2) consecutive weeks prior to the hearing. The board of county commissioners may authorize a proposed facility upon considering that the facility:</p>
                  <p>(i) Is necessary and meets industrial, socioeconomic or municipal needs for additional capacity to manage wastes;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Reduces industry or municipal reliance on waste management methods which would be less suitable for the protection of the environment or public health than would be possible by the proposed facility; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Employs the best available technology to protect public health, safety and the environment, and is located so as to ensure maximum protection of public health, safety and the environment as compared to other alternative methods and locations.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created an expendable trust account to provide a guarantee that adequate monies will be available to close and conduct post-closure monitoring at municipal solid waste disposal facilities, in compliance with the requirements of this article and applicable federal law. Monies shall be paid into and from the account in accordance with this section. Interest earned on investments from the account shall be credited back to the account.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any municipal solid waste disposal facility shall be eligible to participate in the account but shall not be required to participate. Participating facilities shall be eligible for the guarantees provided in subsection (c) of this section. Nonparticipating facilities shall not be eligible for the guarantees provided in subsection (c) of this section. Nonparticipating facilities may either separately or together, take necessary action to comply with state or federal closure and post-closure regulations.</p>
                  <p>(c) Participating facilities are exempt from any requirement under W.S. 35-11-504(c) pertaining to financial assurance requirements for closure and post-closure care of municipal solid waste disposal facilities. The state hereby guarantees, for purposes of compliance with subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, P.L. 94-580, and W.S. 35-11-504(a)(i), that the closure and post-closure care requirements of participating facilities will be satisfied by the provisions of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Each participating facility shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Once every four (4) years prepare a closure and post-closure cost estimate in accord with rules of the council; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Agree to use a standard closure and post-closure cost estimate prepared by the director.</p>
                  <p>(e) Each participating facility shall once every four (4) years calculate the remaining usable solid waste disposal capacity available at the facility, expressed in years. The procedures for calculating remaining capacity shall be prescribed by the director, after consultation with representatives of the participating facilities.</p>
                  <p>(f) Each participating facility shall pay annually into the account a premium, the sum of which at facility closure will equal no less than three percent (3%) of the sum of the closure and post-closure costs estimates specified in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) At any time following the proper certification of facility closure in compliance with rules of the council, a participating facility owner may apply to the director to receive a refund of the closure guarantee costs which have been paid into the account on behalf of the facility.</p>
                  <p>(h) At any time following the proper certification of the conclusion of the post-closure period in compliance with rules of the council, a participating facility owner may apply to the director to receive a refund of the post-closure guarantee costs which have been paid into the account on behalf of the facility.</p>
                  <p>(j) The council is authorized to adopt rules governing payment requirements, expenditures from the account, notifications by owners, disclosures of information, and any other administrative matter associated with the account. Rules of the council shall prescribe that participating facilities electing to cease participating in the account, or applying for refunds under subsection (g) or (h) of this section, shall be entitled to a refund limited to ninety percent (90%) of the actual contribution paid by the facility, less any expenditures paid from the account on behalf of the facility which have not been recovered under subsection (m) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(k) The director shall use the account to perform closure or post-closure maintenance activities at any participating facility, if the facility owner is unable to carry out those responsibilities. The director, subject to appeal to the council, shall determine the amounts of any expenditures from the account.</p>
                  <p>(m) The attorney general shall file suit to recover any funds expended under subsection (k) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(n) Nothing in this section shall relieve any owner or operator of a solid waste management facility of the requirement to comply with applicable closure or post-closure requirements of this act. No third party cause of action is created by this section. Existence of the account does not limit the liability of any owner of a municipal solid waste disposal facility for damages or costs which may occur as the result of any failure to close, or conduct post-closure maintenance, in compliance with this act.</p>
                  <p>(o) For the purpose of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Account" means the account created by subsection</p>
                  <p>(a) of this section;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-517. Fees applicable to hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility operators.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The department shall implement a permit fee system and schedule of fees which are applicable to hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities.</p>
                  <p>(b) Permit fees shall be collected from applicants for permits for any facility subject to subsection (a) of this section, and annually from those existing facilities for the duration of the operating, closure and post-closure permit period. The fees for applicants for permits and the annual fees for inspection and enforcement shall be based on the facility type and size. The department shall develop a fee structure which, to the extent feasible, equitably apportions the department's estimated costs of implementing the requirements of this act applicable to the facilities, which is based on measurable goals, and which is sufficient to recover the amount reviewed by the joint appropriations interim committee and appropriated by the legislature for implementing the hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal permitting program. The fee amount shall be sufficient to provide adequate enforcement of compliance with the hazardous waste requirements of this act, as required in section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6926(b). The department shall prepare a biennium report for review by the joint minerals, business and economic development interim committee by October 31 of the year prior to the Wyoming legislative budget session.</p>
                  <p>(c) Fees shall cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs including the costs of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Reviewing and acting upon any permit application, including applications for major permit amendments;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Implementing and enforcing permits; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Carrying out permit and inspection-related functions performed by the department.</p>
                  <p>(d) The fees collected by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a separate account, and shall be subject to appropriation by the legislature to the department solely for permitting, conducting inspections under and enforcing the requirements of this act governing facilities subject to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department shall give written notice of the amount of the fee to be assessed and the basis for the assessment to the facility owner. The owner may appeal the assessment to the council within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the written notice. The appeal shall be based only upon the allegation that the particular assessment is erroneous or excessive and shall not be based upon the entire fee schedule adopted under this section. The contested case procedures of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act shall apply to any appeal under this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(f) If any part of the assessment is not appealed it shall be paid to the department upon receipt of the written notice.</p>
                  <p>(g) The department in developing a fee schedule shall take into account the financial resources of small businesses as defined by the United States small business administration.</p>
                  <p>(h) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or modify any requirement of W.S. 35-11-503(b) with respect to fees for commercial radioactive waste management facility permits.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created the municipal solid waste facilities cease and transfer program. Grants and loans under the program shall be awarded by the state loan and investment board. The program shall be administered by the solid and hazardous waste division of the department of environmental quality with the input of the waste and water advisory board as provided in W.S. 35-11-528 through 35-11-531.</p>
                  <p>(b) Grants and loans shall be made from the municipal solid waste facilities cease and transfer accounts for all cease and transfer activities as provided in this section and by rule and regulation of the board. Grants and loans shall be made for:</p>
                  <p>(i) Capping of a closed landfill;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Other closure related expenses including engineering, geological and other professional services;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Construction or acquisition of appropriate solid waste transfer facilities and equipment, including acquisition of real property.</p>
                  <p>(c) Total costs of cease and transfer activities for a municipal solid waste facility shall be determined by the department in consultation with the local municipal solid waste facility operator. Grants shall be awarded in an amount determined by the state loan and investment board after consultation with the department and pursuant to the criteria contained in subsection (d) of this section. A municipal solid waste facility which is ceasing operations shall be eligible to receive loans for the costs of cease and transfer activities not funded by a grant pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, grants and loans for cease and transfer activities shall be awarded in an amount determined by the state loan and investment board not to exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the total cost of all cease and transfer activities of the municipal solid waste facility. The state loan and investment board shall base its determination of the percentage of grants and loans awarded for cease and transfer projects under the program on an equitable distribution of available funds among eligible municipal solid waste landfills and rules and regulations adopted pursuant to W.S. 35-11-530. To be eligible for funding under the program the following criteria shall be met:</p>
                  <p>(i) The local operator enters into a written agreement with the department to meet all regulatory obligations under the program;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The local operator implements and revises the community's solid waste management plan as necessary to comply with all regulatory obligations;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The local operator ceases disposal of all municipal solid waste streams at the closed municipal solid waste facility;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The local operator conforms to the requirements of W.S. 35-11-532;</p>
                  <p>(v) The local operator:</p>
                  <p>(A) Ceases disposal into units and facilities regulated under this article which do not have engineered containment systems or do not conform to performance based design standards; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Obtains department approval, that shall include a time period determined appropriate by the department for operation, to:</p>
                  <p>(I) Transfer and dispose municipal solid waste into permitted units and facilities regulated by the department which do not have engineered containment systems or do not conform to performance based design standards, for the purpose of closing the facility that is transferring municipal solid waste; and</p>
                  <p>(II) Increase the rate at which municipal solid waste is accepted for disposal into permitted units and facilities regulated by the department which do not have engineered containment systems or do not conform to performance based design standards, for the purpose of promoting the early closure of the receiving facility or facilities. If the department grants approval under this subparagraph the receiving facility shall not be allowed to enlarge or extend the life of its facility except in furtherance of becoming a facility with an engineered containment system or conforming to performance based design standards.</p>
                  <p>(e) Loans may be made under the program at zero interest rate, up to an annual interest rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined in accordance with this subsection. Loans provided under the program shall be adequately collateralized as determined by the state loan and investment board. Principal and interest payments shall be deposited in the budget reserve account. The state loan and investment board shall establish interest rates to be charged for loans under the program, but the interest rate shall not exceed an annual interest rate equal to the average prime interest rate as determined by the state treasurer. To determine the average prime interest rate, the state treasurer shall average the prime interest rate for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the thirty (30) largest banks in the United States. The interest rate shall be adjusted on January 1 of each year. Interest rates shall be established in recognition of the repayment abilities and needs of the local municipal solid waste facility operator eligible for loans under the program. The state loan and investment board shall establish loan amortization schedules, terms and conditions for each loan approved based on an applicant's need, financial condition of the landfill operator or the entity responsible for solid waste funding, the projected life of the transfer facility and the ability of that entity to repay the loan in a timely manner.</p>
                  <p>(f) Participation in the program shall not restrict funding for a municipal solid waste facility from any other program created or supported by the state.</p>
                  <p>(g) Funds under the program shall not be expended on:</p>
                  <p>(i) Salaries or benefits for employees of the municipal solid waste facility;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Long-term monitoring at a closed municipal solid waste facility or a closed cell of a still operating municipal solid waste facility;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Operational costs of municipal solid waste facilities.</p>
                  <p>(h) Upon a showing that a local operator has exhausted all reasonably available funding sources, the director may recommend to the state loan and investment board funding in the form of grants and loans for up to one hundred percent (100%) of the total cost of cease and transfer activities of the municipal solid waste facility. In addition to the requirements contained in subsection (d) of this section, the state loan and investment board shall base its determination of a grant or loan award under this subsection on whether the local operator:</p>
                  <p>(i) Has any additional funding sources reasonably available to allocate to project costs;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Is charging sufficient gate or use fees to fully fund the operational costs of transfer facilities constructed under the program.</p>

The department shall use monies from the municipal solid waste landfill remediation account as appropriated by the legislature for the administration of the program. Interest earned by this account shall be deposited in the general fund. Notwithstanding W.S. 9-2-1008, 9-2-1012(e) and 9-4-207(a), funds deposited in this account shall not revert without further action of the legislature.</p>
                  <p>(b) For a leaking municipal solid waste landfill to be eligible for use of monies in the account, the owner or operator of the site shall comply with all requirements of the program and regulations of the council adopted pursuant to W.S. 35-11-536.</p>
                  <p>(c) In addition to expenditures from the account authorized by W.S. 35-11-534(a), the department shall issue a credit in an amount not to exceed the local operator's twenty-five percent (25%) share required by W.S. 35-11-534(c)(v) of the total cost of eligible remediation and monitoring activities provided in W.S. 35-11-534(a), for past remediation and monitoring expenses incurred by the local operator as specified in this subsection. The department shall issue credits under this subsection for costs incurred by a local operator for remediation and monitoring activities from the account if:</p>
                  <p>(i) A work plan for the remediation and monitoring activities was submitted to and approved by the department;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The remediation and monitoring activities were initiated after July 1, 2006;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The local operator of a municipal solid waste landfill provides the department with an accurate accounting of the costs of remediation and monitoring activities conducted at the municipal solid waste landfill after July 1, 2006 and the department determines that those remediation and monitoring activities would be eligible for funding if they had been performed under the program;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The local operator conducts additional remediation and monitoring activities at the leaking municipal solid waste landfill which are eligible for funding under W.S. 35-11-534(a) on or after July 1, 2013; and</p>
                  <p>(v) A credit issued under this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost incurred by the local operator for eligible remediation and monitoring activities after July 1, 2006.</p>
                  <p>(d) Repealed by Laws 2015, ch. 47, § 2.</p>

                  <p>(a) The council shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to administer the program after recommendation from the director of the department, the administrator of the solid and hazardous waste division and the water and waste advisory board. The rules shall include but shall not be limited to rules and regulations which:</p>
                  <p>(i) Provide for landfill monitoring and remediation system design, construction, installation and monitoring standards which shall be no less stringent than federal requirements;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Specify the requirements for delegating installation or modification inspection authority including but not limited to requirements for contractors and local operators;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Establish a procedure or procedures for reporting any release from a municipal solid waste landfill;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Include provisions under which priorities for remediation actions shall be established in addition to the priority list created pursuant to W.S. 35-11-524. Those priorities shall be established considering, but not limited to, the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(A) Funding availability;</p>
                  <p>(B) Cost efficiencies achieved by allocation of resources;</p>
                  <p>(C) Opportunities for increased cost sharing between monitoring and remediation actions at multiple leaking municipal solid waste landfills;</p>
                  <p>(D) Timeliness of remediation in reducing risk to public health, safety and welfare or the environment;</p>
                  <p>(E) The likelihood that the remedy will reduce or eliminate the threat posed to public health, safety and welfare or the environment by continuing releases; and</p>
                  <p>(F) Whether the facility has completed closure and transfer actions at the leaking municipal solid waste facility. Priority shall be given to solid waste facilities which have completed closure and transfer actions.</p>
                  <p>(v) Require records for compliance with repairs and upgrades to be maintained for the operational life of the landfill remediation and monitoring system;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Create requirements for participation in the program and for the return of the facility to local control pursuant to W.S. 35-11-534(a); and</p>

                  <p>(a) Any person who owns or is in control of any real or personal property, any plant, building, structure, process or equipment may apply to the administrator of the appropriate division for a variance from any rule, regulation, standard or permit promulgated under this act. A variance may be granted upon notice and hearing. The administrator shall give public notice of the request for a variance in the county in which such real or personal property, plant, building, structure, process or equipment is in existence for which the variance is sought.</p>
                  <p>The notice shall designate who has applied for the variance and the nature of the variance requested and the time and place of hearing and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in said county once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing. The cost of publication shall be paid by the person applying for the variance. The administrator of the division shall promptly investigate the request, consider the views of the persons who may be affected by the grant of the variance, and all facts bearing on the request, and make a decision with the approval of the director within sixty (60) days from the date the hearing for a variance is held.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement or control of the pollution, or mining operation involved, it shall continue in effect only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement or control become known and available, and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the director may prescribe.</p>
                  <p>(c) If the variance is granted on the ground that compliance with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will necessitate the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the director is requisite for the taking of the necessary measures. A variance granted on the ground specified herein shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to such timetable.</p>
                  <p>(d) A variance may be granted by the council from standards established by the council for sulfur oxide emissions, if the council determines that the state of the technology for removal of sulfur oxides from the stack gasses is insufficiently advanced to achieve the objective level without causing undue economic hardship on the owner of the facility or the consumer of the product produced by the facility or if the council determines that the developing technology offers promise that superior equipment might, in the near future, be available which would render presently available equipment obsolete and that the best interests of the state would be served by the issuance of the variance. In considering such a variance, the council must consider the health and well being of the citizens in the vicinity of the facility and the effect upon livestock and agricultural production in the area. In no event shall the variance permit emissions less stringent than existing federal standards covering the emission of sulfur oxides. Each application for a variance will be issued on a case by case basis considering the state of the technology at the time of each application.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the variance is granted on the ground that it is justified to relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than that provided for in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, it shall be for not more than one (1) year.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed on terms and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance. If complaint by an aggrieved party is made to the director on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be granted, unless following public hearing on the complaint on due notice, the council finds that renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the variance.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any variance or renewal thereof granted by the director pursuant to this section shall become final unless within thirty (30) days after date of notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section an aggrieved party as defined by this act in writing may request a hearing before the council. Upon the filing of such a request for a hearing, the variance shall be stayed pending the council's final determination thereon.</p>
                  <p>(h) If, after a hearing held pursuant to this section, the council finds that a variance is required, it shall affirm or modify the order previously issued by the director or issue an appropriate order for variance as it deems necessary. If, after a hearing held pursuant to this section, the council finds that there is no need for a variance, it shall rescind the issuance of a variance.</p>
                  <p>(j) In connection with any hearing held pursuant to this section, the council has the power and upon application by any aggrieved party, it has the duty to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the production of evidence on behalf of all parties.</p>
                  <p>(k) Any aggrieved party adversely affected by a variance or renewal of same or the denial of same may obtain judicial review thereof in the manner prescribed by the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
                  <p>(m) Failure to comply with the conditions imposed by any variance shall be cause for modification or termination of the variance by the director.</p>
                  <p>(n) Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency provisions and procedures of W.S. 35-11-115 to any person or property.</p>
                  <p>(o) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit an application for a water variance. The application for water permits must be made solely under the provisions of W.S. 35-11-302.</p>
                  <p>(p) Nothing in this act or regulations under this act shall be construed to permit an application for a variance which would result in less stringent land use or environmental controls or regulations of surface coal mining and reclamation operations than authorized by P.L. 95-87, as that law is worded on August 3, 1977, or the federal regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>
                  <p>(q) In order to encourage advances in mining and reclamation practices or to allow post-mining land use for industrial, commercial, residential or public use (including recreational facilities), the director, with approval by the secretary of the interior, may authorize departures in individual cases on an experimental basis from the environmental protection performance standards promulgated by the council under this act. Such departures may be authorized if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The experimental practices are potentially more or at least as environmentally protective, during and after mining operations, as those required by promulgated standards;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The mining operations approved for particular land-use or other purposes are not larger or more numerous than necessary to determine the effectiveness and economic feasibility of the experimental practices; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The experimental practices do not reduce the protection afforded public health and safety below that provided by promulgated standards.</p>
                  <p>(r) The secretary of interior, acting through the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement, shall assist the state in the development of a state program for surface coal mining and reclamation operations which meet the requirements of this act and P.L. 95-87, and at the same time, reflect local requirements and local environmental and agricultural conditions.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-701. Complaint; investigations; conference; cease and desist order; hearing; referee.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If the director or the administrators have cause to believe that any persons are violating any provision of this act or any rule, regulation, standard, permit, license, or variance issued pursuant hereto, or in case any written complaint is filed with the department alleging a violation, the director, through the appropriate administrator, shall cause a prompt investigation to be made.</p>
                  <p>(b) For surface coal mining operations, in the instance of a written complaint by any person which provides a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of article 4 of this act, or of any rule, regulation, standard, order, license, variance or permit issued thereunder, exists, the investigation shall include a prompt inspection. In such event the director shall notify the person when the inspection is proposed to be carried out and the person shall be allowed to accompany the inspector during the inspection, subject to reasonable control by the inspector. The operator shall have a duty to exercise reasonable care for the person's safety only if his presence is known. However, this duty shall not include the duty to inspect the premises to discover dangers which are unknown to the operator, nor giving warning or protection against conditions which are known or should be obvious to the person. The operator or his designee shall be allowed to be present for any such inspection.</p>
                  <p>(c) For other than those violations specified under subsection (b) of this section, if, as a result of the investigation, it appears that a violation exists, the administrator of the proper division may, by conference, conciliation and persuasion, endeavor promptly to eliminate the source or cause of the violation:</p>
                  <p>(i) In case of failure to correct or remedy an alleged violation, the director shall cause to be issued and served upon the person alleged to be responsible for any such violation a written notice which shall specify the provision of this act, rule, regulation, standard, permit, license, or variance alleged to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute a violation thereof, and may require the person so complained against to cease and desist from the violation within the time the director may determine;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Any order is final unless, not later than ten (10) days after the date the notice is served, the person or persons named therein request, in writing, a hearing before the council. Upon the filing of a request the order complained of shall be stayed pending the council's final determination thereon;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If after a hearing held pursuant to this section, the council finds that a violation has occurred, it shall affirm or modify such order previously issued, or issue an appropriate order or orders for the prevention, abatement or control of the violation involved or for the taking of other corrective action. If, after a hearing on an order contained in a notice, the council finds that no violation has occurred, it shall rescind the order. Any order issued as part of a notice or after hearing may prescribe the date or dates by which the violation shall cease and may prescribe timetables for action. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as preventing any person from applying for a variance as provided in W.S. 35-11-601;</p>
                  <p>(iv) At any hearing before the council, it may designate a person to be a referee and may authorize the referee to receive evidence, administer oaths, examine witnesses and issue subpoenas requiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence and to make reports and recommendations with respect thereto. Any final determination based on the evidence received by any referee shall be made solely by the council.</p>
                  <p>(d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to in any way limit or contravene any other remedy available under this act, nor shall this section be interpreted as a condition precedent to any other enforcement action under this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) When the department has, by rule or regulation, required a permit to be obtained it is the duty of the director to issue such permits upon proof by the applicant that the procedures of this act and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder have been complied with. In granting permits, the director may impose such conditions as may be necessary to accomplish the purpose of this act which are not inconsistent with the existing rules, regulations and standards. An administrator shall not issue permits and may issue a license under this act only as specifically authorized in this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this act the director shall take final action on any application for permit or extension thereof within sixty (60) days after receipt of same unless public notice or hearing is required by state or federal statute.</p>
                  <p>(c) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, a permit to construct is required before construction or modification of any industrial facility capable of causing or increasing air or water pollution in excess of standards established by the department is commenced.</p>
                  <p>(d) General permits shall be issued solely in accordance with procedures set forth by regulation adopted by the council. Procedures for the issuances of general permits shall include public notice and an opportunity for comment. All department authorizations to use general permits under this section shall be available for public comment for thirty (30) days. Any aggrieved party may appeal the authorization as provided in this act.</p>
                  <p>(e) Except for sources required to have a permit before construction or modification under the applicable requirements of W.S. 35-11-203 and sources specified by the director, if an applicant for an air quality permit for an oil or gas exploration or production well, with its associated equipment, has submitted a timely and complete application for a permit to construct or modify within ninety (90) days of the first date of production of the oil and gas operation, the applicant's failure to have a permit shall not be a violation of this section. An applicant complies with this section if the applicant demonstrates to the administrator of the air quality division that the oil and gas exploration or production activity qualifies as a nonmajor source. The application shall contain, at a minimum, a demonstration that the applicant will apply the best available control technology to the oil and gas production and exploration activity.</p>
                  <p>(f) As used in subsection (e) of this section, "first date of production" means the date permanent production equipment is in place and product is consistently flowing to sales lines, gathering lines or storage tanks. Production occurring during well completion activities which is routed to temporary production equipment is considered to occur prior to the first date of production. If extended periods of time pass between zone completions but production from initially completed zones is consistently flowing to permanent production equipment, the first date of production is the date when production from the initial zones began consistently flowing to the permanent production equipment, even though more zones will be completed later.</p>

                  <p>(a) Notwithstanding W.S. 35-11-901, violations by surface coal mining operations of article 4 of this act, or of any rule, regulation, standard, order, license, variance or permit issued thereunder, shall be governed by this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any person who violates, or any director, officer or agent of a corporate permittee who willfully and knowingly authorizes, orders or carries out the violation of any provision of article 4 of this act for surface coal mining operations, or any rule, regulation, standard, license, variance or permit issued thereunder, or who violates any determination or order of the council pursuant to article 4 of this act for surface coal mining operations is subject to either a penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each day during which a violation continues, or, for multiple violations, a penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each violation for each day during which a violation continues, a temporary or permanent injunction, or both a penalty and an injunction. Penalties and injunctive relief under this subsection may be recovered in a civil action.</p>
                  <p>(c) All notices for abatement and cessation orders shall be reported to the director. The director shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Issue a notice of assessment, if a cessation order was issued;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Make a determination as to whether a notice of assessment will be issued if a notice for abatement was issued.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon issuance of a notice of abatement or cessation order, the director shall inform the operator of the proposed amount of the penalty within thirty (30) days. The amount shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the council. The person charged with the penalty shall have fifteen (15) days to request a conference with the director for informal disposition of any dispute over either the amount of the penalty or the occurrence of the violation.</p>
                  <p>(e) If a conference is held and after the director has determined that a violation did occur and the amount of the penalty is warranted, the person charged with the penalty shall, within fifteen (15) days, either:</p>
                  <p>(i) Pay the proposed penalty in full; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Petition the council for review of either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, submitting a bond equal to the proposed amount of the penalty at the time of filing the petition. The bond shall be conditioned for the satisfaction of the penalty in full, or as modified by the council, if the director's determination as to the occurrence of the violation and the assessment of a penalty is affirmed.

                  <p>(f) If a conference is not requested, the person charged with the penalty has thirty (30) days to take the action required under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) After a petition is effective, the council shall hold a hearing, which shall be conducted as a contested case proceeding under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The council shall either:</p>
                  <p>(i) Determine the occurrence of the violation and the amount of penalty which is warranted for the purpose of ordering that the penalty be paid; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Determine that no violation occurred, or that the amount of the penalty shall be reduced. If such a determination is made, either through administrative or judicial review, the director shall within thirty (30) days remit the appropriate amount to the person, if any deposit has been made, with interest at the rate of six percent (6%), or at the prevailing United States department of treasury rate, whichever is greater. Failure to file an effective petition shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.</p>
                  <p>(h) Any person aggrieved or adversely affected in fact by a final decision of the council pursuant to this section is entitled to judicial review in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

For multiple violations, penalties may be assessed up to the maximum amount specified in this subsection for each day of each separate violation.</p>
                  <p>(k) Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained under article 4 of this act for surface coal mining operations, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required to be maintained under article 4 of this act for surface coal mining operations shall, upon conviction be subject to a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</p>
                  <p>(m) Any person who shall, except as permitted by law, willfully resist, prevent, impede or interfere with the director, any administrator or any of their agents in the performance of their duties in the regulation of surface coal mining operations under article 4 of this act shall be subject to a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</p>
                  <p>(n) Any operator of a surface coal mining operation who fails to correct a violation within the period permitted for its correction, or after a final order or decision issues requiring correction when either the department or a court has relieved the operator from the abatement requirements of the notice or order, shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each day during which the failure or violation continues.</p>
                  <p>(o) Any person who is injured in his person or property through the violation, by any operator, of any rule, regulation, order or permit issued pursuant to article 4 of this act as it provides for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation in accordance with the requirements of P.L. 95-87 may bring an action for damages, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, only in the judicial district in which the surface coal mining operation complained of is located.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-1105. Environmental audit privilege; exceptions; burden of proof; waiver; disclosure after in camera review; application.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) As used in this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) "Environmental audit" means a voluntary, internal and comprehensive evaluation of one (1) or more facilities or an activity at one (1) or more facilities regulated under this act, or of management systems related to the facility or activity, that is designed to identify and prevent noncompliance and to improve compliance with this act. An environmental audit may be conducted by the owner or operator, by the owner's or operator's employees or by independent contractors. Once initiated the voluntary environmental audit shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize uninterrupted voluntary environmental audits;</p>
                  <p>(ii) "Environmental audit report" means a set of documents, each labeled "Environmental Audit Report: Privileged Document," prepared as a result of an environmental audit and may include field notes and records of observations, findings, opinions, suggestions, conclusions, drafts, memoranda, drawings, photographs, computer-generated or electronically recorded information, maps, charts, graphs and surveys if supporting information is generated or developed for the primary purpose and in the course of an environmental audit. An environmental audit report, when completed, shall have three (3) components:</p>
                  <p>(A) An audit report prepared by the auditor, including the scope, commencement and completion dates of the audit, the information gained in the audit, conclusions and recommendations, together with exhibits and appendices;</p>
                  <p>(B) Memoranda and documents analyzing the audit report and discussing implementation issues; and</p>
                  <p>(C) An audit implementation plan that corrects past noncompliance, improves current compliance and prevents future noncompliance.</p>
                  <p>(iii) "In camera review" means a hearing or review in a courtroom, hearing room or chambers to which the general public is not admitted. However, all parties to a civil or administrative proceeding may attend an in camera hearing and shall have a reasonable opportunity to review the documents for which the privilege is claimed and challenge the application of privilege to an environmental audit report. After such hearing or review, the content of oral and other evidence and statements of the judge, counsel and all parties shall be held in confidence by those participating in or present at the hearing or review, and any transcript of the hearing or review shall be sealed and not considered a public record until its contents are disclosed, pursuant to this section, by a court having jurisdiction over the matter.</p>
                  <p>(b) Owners and operators of facilities and persons whose activities are regulated under this act may conduct a voluntary internal environmental audit of compliance programs and management systems to assess and improve compliance with this act. An environmental audit privilege is created to protect the confidentiality of communications relating to these audits.</p>
                  <p>(c) An environmental audit report is privileged and shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil or administrative proceeding, except as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) The owner or operator of a facility may waive this privilege in whole or in part. If an owner or operator of a facility or person conducting an activity seeks to introduce any part of an environmental audit report as evidence in any proceeding, including reporting of violations under W.S. 35-11-1106(a), the privilege is waived as to those sections of the report dealing with that media sought to be introduced into evidence;</p>
                  <p>(ii) In a civil or administrative proceeding, the court or hearing officer after in camera review consistent with the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, shall require disclosure of all or part of the report if it determines:</p>
                  <p>(A) The privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose;</p>
                  <p>(B) The material is not subject to the privilege;</p>
                  <p>(C) The material shows evidence of noncompliance with this act or any federal environmental law or regulation and appropriate efforts to achieve compliance were not pursued as promptly as circumstances permit and completed with reasonable diligence; or</p>
                  <p>(D) The information contained in the environmental audit report demonstrates a substantial threat to the public health or environment or damage to real property or tangible personal property in areas outside of the facility property.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Repealed By Laws 1998, ch. 80, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iv) A party asserting the privilege granted under this section has the burden of proving the privilege, including proof that appropriate efforts to achieve compliance with this act or any federal environmental law or regulation were promptly pursued and completed with reasonable diligence. A party seeking disclosure under subparagraph (c)(ii)(A) of this section has the burden of proving that the privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose;</p>
                  <p>(v) Repealed By Laws 1998, ch. 80, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(vi) Repealed By Laws 1998, ch. 80, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(vii) Repealed By Laws 1998, ch. 80, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(viii) The parties may at any time stipulate to entry of an order directing whether specific information contained in an environmental audit report is subject to the privilege provided under this section;</p>
                  <p>(ix) Upon making a determination under paragraph (c)(ii) of this section, the court shall compel disclosure of those portions of an environmental audit report relevant to issues in dispute in the proceeding.</p>
                  <p>(d) The privilege described in this section shall not extend to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Documents, communications, data, reports or other information required to be collected, developed, maintained, reported or otherwise made available to a regulatory agency or to any person pursuant to any regulatory requirement of this act or any other federal or state law or regulation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Information obtained by observation, sampling or monitoring by any regulatory agency;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Information obtained from a source independent of the environmental audit;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Documents existing prior to the commencement of the environmental audit; or</p>
                  <p>(v) Documents prepared subsequent to and independent of the completion of the environmental audit.</p>
                  <p>(e) Nothing in this section shall limit, waive or abrogate the scope or nature of any statutory or common law privilege, including the work product doctrine and the attorney-client privilege.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-1106. Limitation on civil penalties; voluntary reports of violations.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) If an owner or operator of a facility regulated under this act voluntarily reports to the department a violation disclosed by the audit conducted under W.S. 35-11-1105 within sixty (60) days of the completion date of the audit, the department shall not seek civil penalties or injunctive relief for the violation reported unless:</p>
                  <p>(i) The facility is under investigation for any violation of this act at the time the violation is reported;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The owner or operator does not take action to eliminate the violation within the time frame specified in an order affirmed by the council or otherwise made final pursuant to W.S. 35-11-701(c)(ii);</p>
                  <p>(iii) The violation is the result of gross negligence or recklessness; or</p>
                  <p>(iv) The department has assumed primacy over a federally delegated environmental law and a waiver of penalty authority would result in a state program less stringent than the federal program or the waiver would violate any federal rule or regulation required to maintain state primacy. If a federally delegated program requires the imposition of a penalty for a violation, the voluntary disclosure of the violation shall to the extent allowed under federal law or regulation, be considered a mitigating factor in determining the penalty amount.</p>
                  <p>(b) Reporting a violation is mandatory if required by this act, any departmental rule or regulation, federal law or regulation, local ordinance or resolution, any order of the council or by any court and is therefore not voluntary under this section.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, injunctive relief may be sought under W.S. 35-11-115.</p>
                  <p>(d) The elimination of administrative or civil penalties under this section does not apply if a person or entity has been found by a court to have committed serious violations that constitute a pattern of continuous or repeated violations of environmental laws, rules, regulations, permit conditions, settlement agreements or orders on consent and that were due to separate and distinct events giving rise to the violations, within the three (3) year period prior to the date of the disclosure. A pattern of continuous or repeated violations may also be demonstrated by multiple settlement agreements related to substantially the same alleged violations concerning serious instances of noncompliance with environmental laws that occurred within the three (3) year period immediately prior to the date of the voluntary disclosure.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state reclamation plan may provide for any or all of the following activities:</p>
                  <p>(i) The acquisition, reclamation or restoration of land and water resources which were mined for coal or minerals or affected by coal or other mineral mining processes and left or abandoned in an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under state or federal statutes. The effective date for the purpose of determining eligibility on federal lands managed by the forest service shall be August 28, 1974, and the effective date for determining eligibility on federal lands managed by the bureau of land management shall be November 26, 1980. Any of the activities under this paragraph shall reflect the following priorities in the order stated:</p>
                  <p>(A) The protection of public health, safety, general welfare and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of mining and processing practices;</p>
                  <p>(B) The protection of public health, safety and general welfare from adverse effects of mining and processing practices;</p>
                  <p>(C) The restoration of land and water resources and the environment previously degraded by the adverse effects of coal and mineral mining and processing practices.</p>
                  <p>(D) Repealed by Laws 1991, ch. 72, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(E) Repealed by Laws 1991, ch. 72, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(F) Repealed by Laws 1991, ch. 72, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 1991, ch. 72, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(iii) The acquisition, reclamation and transfer of land to the state or to a political subdivision thereof, or to any person after a determination by the governor that such is an integral and necessary element of an economically feasible plan for a project to construct or rehabilitate housing for persons disabled as the result of employment in the mines or work incidental thereto, persons displaced by acquisition of land pursuant to this article, persons dislocated as a result of adverse effects of coal mining practices which constitute an emergency, or persons dislocated as the result of natural disasters or catastrophic failures from any cause. However, no part of the abandoned mine reclamation funds may be used to pay the actual construction costs of housing;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Repealed by Laws 1991, ch. 72, § 2.</p>
                  <p>(v) Reclamation projects involving the protection, repair, replacement, construction or enhancement of utilities, such as those relating to water supply, roads and other facilities serving the public adversely affected by coal and mineral mining and processing practices. The construction and maintenance of public facilities in communities impacted by coal or mineral mining and processing practices is deemed to be included within the objectives established for the abandoned mine reclamation program, and shall be undertaken in accordance with the priorities stated in paragraph (i) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(b) The state reclamation plan shall be developed by the governor, after recommendation from the director. The director after consulting the administrator of the abandoned land mine division shall make this recommendation only after he has prepared a proposed plan and afforded, at a minimum, an opportunity for the public to inspect and comment on this proposed plan in each county having land and water resources which qualify for acquisition, reclamation or restoration under subsection (a) of this section. All comments shall be recorded and considered in the development of the plan.</p>
                  <p>(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the governor may request abandoned mine land funds be appropriated for the construction of specific public facilities related to the coal or mineral industries or for other activities related to the impacts of these industries.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon approval of the state reclamation plan, the state treasurer shall create an abandoned mine reclamation account for the purpose of accounting for monies received by the state from the secretary of the interior and any other monies authorized to be deposited in the account. The account shall be administered in compliance with the approved plan.</p>
                  <p>(b) Revenue to the account shall include amounts granted by the secretary of the interior under Title IV of P.L. 95-87, monies received by the state for the use or sale of lands acquired with monies from the account and such other monies which may be deposited in the account for use in carrying out the state reclamation program.</p>
                  <p>(c) There is created a coal mine subsidence mitigation account. Revenue to the account shall be ten percent (10%) of the amount granted by the secretary of the interior under title IV of P.L. 95-87 as provided by P.L. 100-34. Revenue shall be deposited in an interest bearing account and all interest shall be credited to the program. No monies from the account shall be expended prior to September 30, 1995. After September 30, 1995 the money may be expended as provided in this subsection. The legislature shall authorize expenditure by appropriation from the account as necessary to defray the administrative expenses of the program. The remaining funds in the account shall only be used to address the reclamation activities described in W.S. 35-11-1202(a)(i)(A) and (B) where mine reclamation is necessary for the protection of the public health or safety, with a priority given to pay for contractual services to mitigate and control mine subsidence that threatens structures. If authorized by the United States congress, funds from the account may be used for the repair or enhancement of structures defined in W.S. 35-11-1301(a)(iii), provided that no funds from the account may be used for any structure where construction is commenced after the effective date of this act unless an engineering assessment documenting the minimal risk of loss from mine subsidence precedes commencement of construction. The liability of the state to fulfill the requirements of this subsection is limited to the amount of funds available in the account established in this subsection. The state has no obligations under this subsection except to the extent of federal funds deposited in the coal mine mitigation account and the interest thereon to operate the program.</p>

                  <p>(a) The director, administrator of the abandoned mine land division, or their designated authorized representative shall have the right to enter upon or have access to any property adversely affected by past coal mining practices to restore, reclaim, abate, control or prevent the adverse effects if the director makes a finding that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The adverse effects on land or water resources are such that, in the public interest, the action should be taken; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The owners of the property either are not known or readily available or refuse to give permission to enter.</p>
                  <p>(b) Prior to entry, notice shall be given by mail to the owners, if known, or if not known, by posting notice upon the premises and advertising once in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the land.</p>
                  <p>(c) Monies expended for work on or to the premises and the benefits accruing to any premises entered upon shall be chargeable against the land and shall mitigate or offset any claim of or any action brought by any owner of any interest in the premises for any alleged damages by virtue of the entry. However, this provision is not intended to create new rights of action or eliminate existing immunities.</p>
                  <p>(d) The director, administrator of the abandoned mine land division, or their designated authorized representatives shall have the right to enter upon any property for the purpose of conducting exploratory work to determine the feasibility to restore, reclaim, abate, control or prevent the adverse effects.</p>
                  <p>(e) Any entry under this section shall be construed as an exercise of the state's police power and shall not be construed as an act of condemnation or trespass.</p>

                  <p>(a) The state may acquire any land, by purchase, donation or condemnation, which is adversely affected by past coal mining practices if the director, with the concurrence of the governor, finds that acquisition of the land is necessary to successful reclamation and that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The acquired land, after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices, will serve recreation and historic purposes, conservation and reclamation purposes or provide open space benefits; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Permanent facilities such as a treatment plant or a relocated stream channel will be constructed on the land for the restoration, reclamation, abatement, control or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) Acquisition of coal refuse disposal sites and all coal refuse thereon will serve the purposes of this article or that public ownership is desirable to meet emergency situations and prevent recurrences of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.</p>
                  <p>(b) Title to all lands acquired pursuant to this section shall be in the name of the state. The price paid for land acquired under this section shall reflect the market value of the land as adversely affected by past coal mining practices.</p>
                  <p>(c) Where land acquired pursuant to this section is deemed to be suitable for industrial, commercial, residential or recreational development, the director, with the approval of the governor and the secretary of the interior, may sell the land for at least fair market value by public sale under a system of competitive bidding.</p>
                  <p>(d) The director, when requested after appropriate public notice, shall hold a public hearing, with appropriate notice, in the county or counties in which lands acquired pursuant to this section are located in order to afford all persons an opportunity to participate in the decision concerning the use or disposition of the lands after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices.</p>

                  <p>(a) Within six (6) months after the completion of projects to restore, reclaim, abate, control or prevent adverse effects of past coal or mineral mining practices on privately owned land, the director shall itemize the monies expended and may file a lien against the property with the appropriate county clerk. If the monies expended result in a significant increase in property value, a notarized appraisal by an independent appraiser shall be filed with the lien. The lien shall be the amount determined by the appraisal to be the increase in the fair market value of the land as a result of the restoration, reclamation, abatement, control or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal or mineral mining practices.

                  <p>(a) This article is known and may be cited as the "Storage Tank Act of 2007".</p>
                  <p>(b) The legislature recognizes the threat to the public health, safety, welfare and the environment caused by pollution to soil and water from underground and aboveground storage tanks. The purpose of this article is to take primacy of the underground storage tank program and to provide funding to take corrective actions at sites contaminated by underground storage tanks and aboveground storage tanks.</p>
                  <p>(c) The legislature also recognizes that owners and operators cannot take corrective action without placing their businesses' existence in financial jeopardy. The legislature finds that, because Wyoming is a large rural state, it is in the public interest to take corrective action at contaminated sites so that fuel will continue to be readily available throughout Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department shall prepare an annual report for the legislature identifying the actions taken and monies expended pursuant to this article.</p>

The department shall use monies from the corrective action account as appropriated by the legislature for the administration of this article, W.S. 35-11-533 through 35-11-537 and 35-11-1701. Interest earned by this account shall be deposited in the general fund. Monies in the corrective action account shall also be used for the state water pollution control revolving loan account pursuant to W.S. 16-1-201 through 16-1-207. Except as provided in subsection (p) of this section, and contingent on availability of money in the corrective action account, the director shall distribute monies in the corrective action account to the solid waste landfill remediation account created by W.S. 35-11-535 and the orphan site remediation account created pursuant to W.S. 35-11-1701 on July 1 of each specified year in an amount up to:</p>
                  <p>(i) 2019-one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) to the solid waste landfill remediation account and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) to the orphan site remediation account;</p>
                  <p>(ii) 2020-four million dollars ($4,000,000.00) to the solid waste landfill remediation account and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) to the orphan site remediation account;</p>
                  <p>(iii) 2021 - five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) to the solid waste landfill remediation account and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) to the orphan site remediation account;</p>
                  <p>(iv) 2022 - five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) to the solid waste landfill remediation account and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) to the orphan site remediation account;</p>
                  <p>(v) 2023 - six million dollars ($6,000,000.00) to the solid waste landfill remediation account and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) to the orphan site remediation account;</p>
                  <p>(vi) 2024 through 2028 - provided that in no event shall monies in the corrective action account on July 1 of any year of this period be less than two million dollars ($2,000,000.00), the director shall:</p>
                  <p>(A) Determine expected expenditures from the corrective action account for the underground storage tank program for the next fiscal year and retain monies equal to that amount in the corrective action account;</p>
                  <p>(B) Deposit up to one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) from the remainder of the monies in the corrective action account into the orphan site remediation account; and</p>
                  <p>(C) Deposit the remainder of the monies from the corrective action account into the solid waste landfill remediation account.</p>
                  <p>(vii) 2029 and each year thereafter-the director shall determine expected expenditures from the corrective action account for the underground storage tank program for the next fiscal year and retain monies equal to that amount in the corrective action account, with the remainder of the monies being divided and deposited at the director's discretion into the solid waste landfill remediation account and the orphan site remediation account, but in no event shall monies in the corrective action account on July 1 of any year be less than two million dollars ($2,000,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(b) The department shall establish priority lists of sites contaminated by tanks. The priorities shall be based on public health, safety and welfare and environmental concerns. The council after recommendation from the director of the department, the administrator of the various divisions and their respective advisory boards shall promulgate rules and regulations for defining priorities.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department shall use corrective action account monies to take corrective actions at sites contaminated by tanks. The department shall take corrective actions based on the sites' placement on the priority list. However, if an emergency threat to public health, safety and welfare or to the environment exists, or costs of cleanup may be significantly reduced, a site may be moved up on the priority list for immediate corrective action.</p>
                  <p>(d) For a site to be eligible for use of monies in the corrective action account, the owner or operator of the site shall, if required, pay the tank fee required by W.S. 35-11-1425, conduct a minimum site assessment, as defined by rule and regulation, and, if contamination is found, take action to prevent continuing contamination. The department shall notify all owners and operators on record at the department of the minimum site assessment requirements. Sites which do not meet the eligibility requirements specified in this subsection shall not be eligible for use of any monies in the corrective action account. Owners and operators of these ineligible sites shall not use the corrective action account for proof of financial assurance for the sites. Pending determination of the site's eligibility, the department may use corrective action account monies for corrective actions at a contaminated site.</p>
                  <p>(e) Sites where tanks have been removed or abandoned in accordance with any government regulations effective at the time of abandonment may become eligible for use of corrective action account monies if the person who owns the site pays a two hundred dollar ($200.00) annual fee per site and conducts a site assessment as required by subsection (d) of this section. The annual fee per site required under this subsection shall be paid for a maximum of ten (10) years and shall then lapse until corrective action is undertaken by the department. Failure to meet these requirements may subject the person who owns the site to suit for corrective action or cost recovery. The fee collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the corrective action account. The department shall notify all the owners and operators who are on record at the department who have removed or properly abandoned a tank of the provisions of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(f) If, after due diligence, no owner or operator can be found, a contaminated site shall be placed on the priority list in appropriate rank with other sites. If an owner or operator of a site which is not in compliance and the owner or operator refuses to comply with subsection (d) of this section is discovered, that site shall be considered as ineligible for use of corrective action account monies and shall be treated as defined in subsection (g) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(g) The department may, by an action brought by the attorney general against an owner or operator, recover reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the department in taking a corrective action. These recoverable expenses include but are not limited to costs of investigating a release, administrative costs and reasonable attorney fees. The department's certification of expenses is prima facie evidence the expenses are reasonable and necessary. Expenses recovered under this section shall be deposited in the corrective action account unless otherwise required by state or federal law. The department may sue for recovery of expenses only if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The owner or operator has failed to take the actions required for that site in subsection (d) of this section; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The owner or operator had tank insurance for that site at the time of the release. However no such recovery under this subsection may exceed the limits or coverage of the insurance policy in question.</p>
                  <p>(h) The state has a right of subrogation to any insurance policies in existence at the time of the release to the extent of any rights the owner may have had under that policy. This right of subrogation shall apply regardless of the owner's eligibility to use corrective action account monies under subsection (d) of this section. In implementing this section the department shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Notify all known owners and operators, past and present, of sites where contamination from a tank is known to exist and request information relating to any insurance policies they possess or possessed at the time of release that may provide coverage for corrective action or cleanup of the contamination at the site;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Notify all insurance companies which have been identified to the department pursuant to W.S. 35-11-1419 and may have issued insurance policies that provide coverage for contamination from tanks and request copies of any such policies. In notifying insurance companies the department shall provide the insurance company with the name of all known owners, past and present, and the legal description of the site upon which the tank is or was located. The department notification shall require each insurance company to notify the department whenever there is a change in the insurance policy, including cancellation.</p>
                  <p>(j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize payments for the repair, removal or replacement of any tank or equipment.</p>
                  <p>(k) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize payments or commitments for payments in amounts in excess of the monies available.</p>
                  <p>(m) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of notification that the corrective action account has become incapable of paying for assured corrective actions, the owner or operator shall obtain alternate financial assurance.</p>
                  <p>(n) Any person or insurance company notified by the department under paragraph (h)(i) or (ii) of this section shall provide the requested information to the department within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notification. In addition to other remedies provided for in this act, failure of any insurance company to provide copies of the requested policies shall result in the statute of limitations provided in subsection (o) of this section being tolled for any action the department may bring in subrogation until such time as the policy is discovered.</p>
                  <p>(o) Notwithstanding any other applicable period of limitation, upon notification by any owner, operator or insurance company of any insurance coverage in existence, the department shall have five (5) years to commence any action for the recovery of proceeds under the applicable policy.</p>
                  <p>(p) The director is authorized to withhold distributions from the corrective action account to the solid waste remediation account and the orphan site remediation account as provided in subsection (a) of this section in the event of:</p>
                  <p>(i) An emergency involving a leaking underground storage tank which requires immediate corrective action which will require an expenditure of monies in excess of the monies available in the corrective action account; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Monies in the account are less than the amount required by federal law to provide for financial assurance coverage or adequate leaking underground storage tank remediation.</p>
                  <p>(q) The director shall submit a report to the joint minerals, business and economic development interim committee by June 15, 2019 and by June 15 of every year thereafter, describing the amount to be withheld in the corrective action account pursuant to subsections (a) and (p) of this section, and the factors used in making those determinations, and describing the distributions of monies from the corrective action account to the solid waste landfill remediation account and the orphan site remediation account.</p>
                  <p>(r) Repealed by Laws 2018, ch. 12, § 2.</p>

                  <p>(b) On April 1 of each year the department may assess a late payment fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per tank or contaminated site against any owner who has not paid the annual fee required pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or W.S. 35-11-1424(e). This late fee shall be paid by the owner and shall be in addition to the annual fee required pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or W.S. 35-11-1424(e) and shall be deposited in the department's corrective action account.</p>
                  <p>(c) The change from July 1 to January 1 for the due date of storage tank fees shall be revenue neutral. The department shall collect one-half (1/2) of the annual fee on July 1, 2007 and shall collect the full annual fee on January 1, 2008 and annually thereafter.</p>

                  <p>(a) As provided in this section, the department shall, on application by an owner or operator, direct the payment of monies from the financial responsibility account to satisfy judgments against the owner or operator for third party property damage or personal injury.</p>
                  <p>(b) The attorney general shall be served by certified mail return receipt requested with a copy of the complaint filed in any suit initiated against an owner or operator for third party property damage or personal injury. Service of the complaint on the attorney general is a jurisdictional requirement in order to maintain the suit. The attorney general shall be notified in writing by certified mail return receipt requested of any judgment, compromise, settlement or release entered into by an owner or operator. As provided in this section, the department shall, on application by an owner or operator, direct the payment of monies from the financial responsibility account to pay settlements for third party property damage or personal injury on terms negotiated by the attorney general and approved by the council.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-1506. Legislative approval of the siting of high-level radioactive waste storage facilities; conditions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, no construction may commence, nor shall any high-level radioactive waste storage facility be sited within this state, unless the legislature has enacted legislation approving the siting, construction and operation of the facility in accord with this section. Any authorization of a facility under this section shall not be considered to grant to any person an exclusive right or franchise to store high-level radioactive wastes within the state.</p>
                  <p>(b) In addition to any facility which meets the requirements of subsection (e) of this section, the legislature may authorize one (1) or more facilities under subsection (a) of this section if it finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The siting of a high-level radioactive waste storage facility within the state is in the best interests of the people of Wyoming;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The siting of a high-level radioactive waste storage facility within the state can be accomplished without causing irreversible adverse environmental, public health, social or economic impacts to the state as a whole, and specifically to the local area hosting the proposed storage facility;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The proposed benefits agreement is sufficient to offset any adverse environmental, public health, social or economic impacts to the state as a whole, and specifically to the local area hosting the proposed storage facility; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Sufficient safeguards, by contractual assurances or other means, exist to provide that:</p>
                  <p>(A) The authorization to site, construct and operate any proposed storage facility shall be limited to no more than forty (40) years, provided that extensions may be granted if the legislature enacts legislation authorizing nuclear waste storage facilities to operate for more than forty (40) years;</p>
                  <p>(B) Any wastes in storage at any facility shall remain the property of the waste generator or civilian nuclear power reactor owner, until transferred to permanent storage or until the federal government takes title to the wastes under the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10101 et seq.;</p>
                  <p>(C) Conditions substantially equivalent to the licensing conditions imposed upon monitored retrievable storage facilities under 42 U.S.C. § 10168(d) existing as of March 1, 1995 shall be effective for any high-level radioactive waste storage facility authorized under this article; and</p>
                  <p>(D) There exists either a cooperative agreement between the state and the nuclear regulatory commission, or such other legally binding agreement for specific performance between the director and the applicant, which shall provide for state regulation of the facility.</p>
                  <p>(c) With permission of the governor and the management council, an applicant for either a monitored retrievable storage facility or an independent spent fuel storage installation may enter into a preliminary but nonbinding feasibility agreement and study with the director which shall be submitted to and reviewed by the director, governor and the management council. The public shall be afforded a thirty (30) day public comment opportunity to review the feasibility agreement prior to its submission to the governor and the management council. The purposes of this feasibility agreement and study are to allow the state to make a preliminary determination, whether, on the basis of the feasibility agreement and study, the proposed benefits substantially outweigh any adverse effects and to allow an applicant based on the state's preliminary review of any proposed benefit to determine whether or not a prudent investor, planner, builder and operator would decide to proceed with an application. Upon entering into a feasibility agreement, the applicant shall pay to the state a fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000.00). Effective July 1, 2018, and annually thereafter, the fee shall be adjusted for inflation by the department using the consumer price index or its successor index of the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, for the calendar year immediately preceding the date of adjustment. The fee shall be used by the department for costs attendant to the preliminary agreement. Excess funds collected may be used by the department to review an application submitted under W.S. 35-11-1502. Appropriate time shall be afforded the director, the governor, the management council and the applicant to prepare and to evaluate the preliminary agreement and study, but neither the state nor the applicant shall unnecessarily delay the feasibility agreement and study.</p>
                  <p>The preliminary feasibility agreement and study shall not supersede nor replace other requirements under this act. This agreement and study shall set forth the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The source and adequacy of the financing for the facility and the applicant's ability to fulfill the terms of any contract entered into regarding the siting, construction or operation of the facility. The information required under this paragraph shall include, but is not limited to, audited financial statements covering the five (5) year period prior to the feasibility agreement, a listing of all partners if the applicant is a partnership and a listing of all persons owning or controlling five percent (5%) or more of its stock if the applicant is a corporation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Financial strengths of prospective storage customers;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The technical experience of the applicant and his associates in permitting before the nuclear regulatory commission, and in design, construction and operation of nuclear facilities;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The preliminary design plan and technical feasibility of the planned temporary fuel rod storage facility;</p>
                  <p>(v) The best estimate of a range of costs for the permitting, planning and construction of the facility, based upon available information;</p>
                  <p>(vi) The proposed storage capacity of the planned facility, necessary to give reasonable assurance of economic feasibility, with evidence to show that the proposed storage capacity will not adversely affect the health and safety of Wyoming people or the environment;</p>
                  <p>(vii) How the applicant will proceed with the facility to assure that its construction, operation and decommissioning will neither temporarily nor permanently adversely affect the health and safety of Wyoming people;</p>
                  <p>(viii) A best estimate of a time frame required to obtain the necessary permits, including nuclear regulatory commission licensing, design and construction, and a suggested time frame for decisions by Wyoming government to meet the target timetable;</p>
                  <p>(ix) An outline of transportation plans, including rail and highway;</p>
                  <p>(x) Substantial assurances that the facility is temporary, including options for that assurance including a time frame for the movement of the temporarily stored fuel rods to a permanent repository, delivery of the stored rods to reprocessing centers or to a purchaser, domestic or foreign, buying the rods for future reprocessing;</p>
                  <p>(xi) A range of benefits the nearby communities and the state might expect in return for temporarily storing the fuel rods, and a best estimate of when the benefits might begin to be received by the nearby communities and state;</p>
                  <p>(xii) A mutual review, by the state and applicant, of a range of taxes the state might reasonably impose on the facility and the fuel rods while they are in temporary storage including the annual acceptance taxes to be levied on fuel rods, based upon the kilograms of fuel rods stored at the Wyoming facility;</p>
                  <p>(xiii) A description of security measures that would be installed in and around the facility to isolate and protect it from intruders;</p>
                  <p>(xiv) A description of an emergency response procedure in the event of an unusual occurrence;</p>
                  <p>(xv) An outline of the information program an applicant would initiate to explain its plans to the community and state;</p>
                  <p>(xvi) A description of site suitability characteristics and evidence that the applicant's proposed site for the facility meets those characteristics;</p>
                  <p>(xvii) Evidence of support from nearby Wyoming communities for exploring the project.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the legislature authorizes the siting of a facility under subsection (a) of this section, the department shall issue a permit incorporating the conditions presented to the legislature including the benefits agreement. The issuance of the permit is not appealable to the environmental quality council. The permit shall also include a provision for payment by the permittee of inspection and review costs unless such costs are included in the benefits agreement.</p>
                  <p>(e) The legislature hereby authorizes the siting of temporary high-level radioactive waste storage facilities within this state subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) A facility shall only be authorized if it is operated on the site of and to store the waste produced by a nuclear power generation facility operating within the state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The applicant for the facility shall otherwise comply with the requirements of this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The department shall review the application submitted pursuant to W.S. 35-11-1502 and determine specifically if the facility meets the safety considerations in paragraph (b)(iv) of this section and any other potential safety or environmental concerns;</p>
                  <p>(iv) After preparation of the report under W.S. 35-11-1503 and public review under W.S. 35-11-1504, the department may authorize siting and construction of the facility;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a facility is authorized by the department under paragraph (iv) of this subsection, the benefits agreement shall be the agreement as negotiated with the applicant under W.S. 35-11-1503(d).</p>

                  <p>(a) This article establishes the requirements and procedures necessary for voluntary remediation of eligible sites under this act, and shall not authorize unpermitted releases of contaminants to the environment of the state. Consistent with the policy and purpose of this act, this article shall provide incentive to remediate eligible sites and establish criteria for application of site-specific, risk-based remediation. All voluntary remediation requirements for eligible sites shall be performed in accordance with this article and shall be contained in a remedy agreement issued under W.S. 35-11-1607. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, no additional remediation requirements may be imposed by the department under this act for remediation of any site subject to a remedy agreement issued under W.S. 35-11-1607, unless the remedy agreement has been reopened or terminated under W.S. 35-11-1610. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the imposition of remediation requirements to address the release of a contaminant which may occur after a remedy agreement has been entered into or a no further action letter has been issued. Remediation authorized by the department under this article shall not be deemed a prohibited act under this act, or of any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.</p>
                  <p>(b) Remediation is not voluntary under this article if it is required:</p>
                  <p>(i) By order of the department, council or by any court and entered without the consent of a person; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) By order of the department, council or by any court and entered without the consent of a person who has failed or refused to enter into, or breached the terms of, a preliminary remediation agreement, remedy agreement or reopened remedy agreement; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) By administrative or judicial order to which the United States environmental protection agency is a party, which is issued after the effective date of this act, on a site that has been determined not to be eligible under W.S. 35-11-1603.</p>

                  <p>(a) Following any determination by the department that a site is an eligible site, or following the submission of any application to modify an existing remedy agreement, the owner or operator shall give written notice to all surface owners of record of land which is contiguous to the site, and to all known adjacent surface owners of record of land, and shall publish notice once per week for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located. The notice published in a newspaper shall be a display advertisement. The notice to individual landowners and the notice published in a newspaper shall identify the site, provide a summary of the criterion in W.S. 35-11-1602 which makes the site eligible for participation in the voluntary remediation program under this article, describe the process for the public to request the development of a public participation plan under subsection (b) of this section, and provide a thirty (30) day period for the public to request that a public participation plan be developed.</p>
                  <p>(b) For any eligible site where there is significant public interest as determined by the director after considering the factors enumerated in paragraphs (i) through (iii) of this subsection, the person who has submitted an application for participation, or the owner of the site, shall prepare and implement a public participation plan which shall be approved by the director. In preparing the plan, the applicant or owner shall consult with and consider the public participation needs of interested parties, including but not limited to contiguous surface owners of record and all known adjacent surface owners of record of land, local government, local economic development agencies or groups, and public interest groups. In determining whether there is significant public interest, the director shall consider whether there have been responses to the notice required under subsection (a) of this section requesting the development of a public participation plan by:</p>
                  <p>(i) At least twenty-five (25) individuals;</p>
                  <p>(ii) An organization representing at least twenty- five (25) individuals; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The governing body of a local government.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any owner or operator of an eligible site which is also subject to permitting or corrective action requirements of the hazardous waste rules and regulations promulgated under W.S. 35-11-503(d) shall prepare and implement a public participation plan which complies with those rules and regulations.</p>
                  <p>(d) At a minimum for any eligible site regardless of whether a public participation plan has been required, prior to entering into a remedy agreement, the owner shall give written notice of the proposed remedy agreement to all surface owners of record of land adjacent to the site, and publish notice once per week for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located. The notice shall be of a form and content prescribed by the department, and shall summarize the proposed remedy agreement, provide a description of the site, provide for a thirty (30) day public comment period after the date of the last publication, and provide an opportunity for an oral hearing. An oral hearing on the proposed remedy agreement shall be held if the department finds sufficient interest. The department may enter into a remedy agreement following the public comment period or any hearing, whichever is later.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>35-11-1605. Voluntary remediation standards; site- specific, risk-based standards; considerations in choice of remedy; alternate standards for soil; alternate standards for soil or water; point of compliance; contamination from source not on site; alternate remediation standards for site contaminated from source not on site; supplemental requirements.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Consistent with any requirements necessary to retain state primacy in federal programs, any remedy proposed by an owner of an eligible site, or considered by the director, shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Be protective of human health, safety and the environment. A remedy shall be considered to be protective of human health if it reduces risk to human receptors of acute and chronic toxic exposures to contaminants to levels that do not pose a significant risk to human health. A remedy shall be considered to be protective of the environment if it adequately reduces risk of significant adverse impacts to ecological receptors for which habitats have been identified on or near the site. Remedies may meet this requirement through a combination of monitored natural attenuation, removal, treatment, or engineering or institutional controls. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, any site where a remedy is proposed that includes engineering or institutional controls must also have been designated as a use control area in accord with W.S. 35-11-1609;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Attain standards established by the director under this subsection for air, soil, and water affected by the site, unless the director sets an alternate standard in accord with subsection (c) or (d) of this section. No standard set under this section for a contaminant shall be set at a level or concentration lower than the background level or concentration for that contaminant. A remedy must attain standards or alternate standards by the end of the remediation period set forth in the remedy agreement. A remedy shall be considered to attain standards for air, soil and water if it:</p>
                  <p>(A) Meets any applicable media standards established under federal or state law or rule or regulation; or</p>
                  <p>(B) Meets site-specific, risk-based standards developed for the eligible site. Site-specific, risk-based standards shall establish a risk reduction goal for contaminants which are known or suspected carcinogens to ensure that the excess upper bound lifetime cancer risk to any exposed individual may not exceed a probability of developing cancer of one in one million (1 in 1,000,000) to one in ten thousand (1 in 10,000). The one in one million (1 in 1,000,000) risk level shall be used as the point of departure for determining remediation goals for alternatives when individual contaminant standards are not available, or are not sufficiently protective because of the presence of multiple contaminants at a site or multiple pathways of exposures. Site-specific, risk-based standards must also require that for contaminants which are systemic toxicants, the hazard index must not exceed one (1). The director shall use residential exposure factors, giving consideration to children and the elderly, to establish site- specific, risk-based standards under this subsection for soils and air. The exposure factors to be used by the director to establish site-specific, risk-based standards under this subsection for hazardous substances in groundwater shall assume that groundwater may be used as a drinking water source, provided that no standard set under this subsection for a contaminant shall be set at a level or concentration lower than the background level or concentration for that contaminant. For nonhazardous substances, the exposure factors to be used by the director shall assume uses consistent with the class of use prior to contamination of the groundwater.</p>
                  <p>(iii) Control any sources of releases so as to reduce or eliminate, to the extent technically practicable, further releases as required to protect human health and the environment. A remedy shall be considered to control sources of releases if it controls the release of contaminants from sources to any media in concentrations that exceed applicable standards set by the director under paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, or the soil standards under subsection (c) or (d) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Comply with any applicable standard for management of wastes generated as a consequence of the remedy. A remedy shall be considered to comply with applicable standards for management of wastes if all wastes generated as a consequence of implementation of the remedy are treated, stored or disposed of in compliance with the requirements of this act.</p>
                  <p>(b) The director shall choose a remedy, or combination of remedies, from among those remedies which meet the requirements of subsection (a), (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable. In choosing a remedy, the director shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(i) The extent to which the remedy will be reliable and effective for the long term. For remedies that include engineering or institutional controls in accord with a use control area designation, the director shall consider the expected life cycle performance of any engineering controls, monitoring systems and institutional controls;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The extent to which the remedy results in a reduction of toxicity, mobility or volume of contaminants. The director shall consider the degree to which remedies incorporate treatment or removal of contaminants to lower long term risk to human health and the environment;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The short term effectiveness of the remedy.</p>
                  <p>The director shall consider the time required for each remedy to attain standards for air, soil and water specified in paragraph (a)(ii) or subsection (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable. A remedy involving monitored natural attenuation may be considered whether or not the director has made a determination of technical impracticability under subsection (d) of this section. Monitored natural attenuation shall be deemed effective if there is evidence that natural attenuation is occurring and will be completed within a reasonable time period;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Impacts which may be caused by implementation of the remedy. The director shall consider any adverse impacts which may be caused by a remedy, and shall take into consideration the gravity of any projected impact and the cost and availability of measures to mitigate the impact;</p>
                  <p>(v) The extent and nature of contamination and practicable capabilities of remedial technologies, and whether achieving standards is technically impracticable;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Reasonably anticipated future land uses or use restrictions in a use control area designation;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Consistency of remedies with the nature and complexities of releases of contaminants; and</p>
                  <p>(viii) Cost of the remedy. The director shall consider whether a remedy presents a substantial and disproportionately high cost for implementation and completion. The director shall compare the costs of remedies considering the degree of risk reduction that is afforded by each remedy. Costs considered shall include capital, operation and maintenance, engineering and institutional control costs and monitoring costs for the anticipated life of the remedy.</p>
                  <p>(c) The director may establish alternate site-specific, risk-based standards for surface and subsurface soils to be employed at a site in lieu of the soil standards in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section, for any site that is located within a use control area designated under W.S. 35-11-1609. A remedy that employs alternate standards established by the director under this subsection shall meet the requirements of this subsection and paragraphs (a)(i), (iii) and (iv) of this section. The alternate standards for such a site shall use the carcinogenic and systemic toxicant risk reduction goals of subparagraph (a)(ii)(B) of this section, except that the exposure assumptions used to calculate the alternate standards under this subsection shall be consistent with the use restrictions contained in the use control area designation. If the director establishes alternate soil standards under this subsection, the owner or operator must evaluate technologies that can meet the alternate soil standards. Owners or operators of eligible sites that implement remedies which achieve the alternate soil standards set under this subsection may be issued a certificate of completion and covenant not to sue pursuant to W.S. 35-11-1607. The soil standards of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section must be met if the owner or operator applies to remove the use restrictions applicable to the site or to receive a no further action letter under W.S. 35-11-1608.</p>
                  <p>(d) The director may establish alternate site-specific, risk-based standards for soil or water to be employed at a site in lieu of the soil and water standards in paragraph (a)(ii) of this section if, after evaluation of currently available technology the director determines that it is technically impracticable to meet a standard at a specific site. A remedy that employs alternate standards established by the director under this subsection shall meet the requirements of this subsection and paragraphs (a)(i), (iii) and (iv) of this section. The technical impracticability determination shall include evaluation of the cost of remedy alternatives, including but not limited to, substantial and disproportionately high costs, present worth of construction, operation and maintenance costs, continued operational costs of the remedy selected and costs of any proposed alternative remedy strategies. Whenever the director sets an alternate standard, the director shall select a remedy capable of meeting the alternate standard and which is technically practicable, controls any sources of contamination to the extent technically practicable, and controls human and environmental exposures to contaminated air, soil or water. The director may establish alternate standards for soil or water under this subsection only if the owner has or obtains rights to control human or environmental exposures to contaminated media, and consents to impose such controls as are required to protect human health and the environment. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, or W.S. 35-11-1609 such controls may be imposed by the owner without the site receiving a use control area designation under W.S. 35-11-1609. The standards of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section must be met if the owner or operator applies to remove the use restrictions applicable to the site or to receive a no further action letter under W.S. 35-11-1608.</p>
                  <p>(e) When establishing standards under paragraph (a)(ii) or subsection (c) or (d) of this section, the director shall specify one (1) or more points of compliance where standards must be achieved. In specifying a point of compliance, the director shall consider the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(i) Compliance with groundwater standards shall be monitored as close as reasonably practical to the contaminant source or site boundary or boundary of the use control area. The director shall select any groundwater point of compliance based upon the evaluation of the properties of the aquifer, the proximity of existing and reasonably anticipated points of groundwater withdrawal or discharge to the surface, the location of the contaminant plume relative to the site or use control area boundary, the toxicity of the contaminant, the presence and proximity of multiple contaminant sources, the exposure and likelihood of actual exposure to contaminated groundwater, and the technical practicability of groundwater remediation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For soils, standards shall be met at locations determined to ensure protection of human health and identified environmental receptors, and protection of surface water, groundwater and air resulting from any potential transfer of contaminants from soils to these other media; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) For surface water, standards shall be met at the point where any release enters any surface water of the state consistent with applicable federal and state requirements. If sediments are affected by releases to surface water, a sediment point of compliance may also be established.</p>
                  <p>(f) Remediation standards for a site that has become contaminated by a release or migration of contamination from a source not located on the site shall be appropriate for any use control area designation applicable to such site, or if desired by the owner the remediation requirements shall be adequate to restore the site to all uses for which it was suitable prior to the contamination.</p>
                  <p>(g) The department may establish supplemental requirements for owners or operators of lands or facilities subject to permitting or corrective action requirements of the hazardous waste rules and regulations promulgated under W.S. 35-11-503(d) as may be necessary to ensure that such sites are characterized and remediated in a manner which is consistent with, equivalent to, and no less stringent [than] permitting, closure, post- closure and corrective action requirements contained in rules and regulations adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under authority of subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6901, et seq. Election by an eligible site owner or operator who is subject to such hazardous waste permitting or corrective action requirements to participate in the voluntary remediation program under this article shall not relieve the owner or operator of the duty to comply with all requirements of the hazardous waste rules and regulations promulgated under W.S. 35-11-503(d).</p>

                  <p>(a) The preliminary remediation agreement shall contain the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, which shall include the information and procedures required for completion of an environmental assessment or site characterization that is adequate and appropriate to support selection of a permanent or long term protective remedy for the site and adjacent property to meet the standards in W.S. 35-11-1605, and a work plan, schedule and statement of any criteria the department intends to use to evaluate work plans and reports.</p>
                  <p>(b) For any site that is determined by the director to have the potential for significant contamination, be located in an area where human exposures to contaminants are likely, or require evaluation of remedial alternatives as a condition for the state to maintain primacy in any federal program, the director shall require the site characterization plan within the preliminary remediation agreement under this section to include a description of alternative remedial actions to be evaluated and a plan for the collection of any data and site information needed to evaluate those alternative remedial actions. Not all potential remedies must be evaluated for a site. The director and the owner may enter into a single agreement containing both characterization and alternative remedial action evaluation plans, or may enter into an alternative remedial action evaluation agreement following completion of site characterization.</p>

                  <p>(a) Except as provided in W.S. 35-11-1605(d), before an owner and the department may enter into a remedy agreement that includes long-term restrictions on the use of the site, the owner must obtain a use control area designation for the site as set forth in W.S. 35-11-1609. The use restrictions contained in any use control area designation may be used by the director to establish any alternate soil standard as provided in W.S. 35-11-1605(c).</p>
                  <p>(b) Any remedy agreement shall contain:</p>
                  <p>(i) A remedial action plan, including the remediation standards and objectives for the site or use control area, the remediation standards and objectives for adjacent property, a description of any engineering or institutional control, a schedule for the required remediation activities, and conditions for the effective and efficient implementation of the remedy agreement. The department shall require a suitable bond or other evidence of financial assurance to assure the performance and maintenance of engineering controls and any monitoring activities required in a remedy agreement; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The reopeners or termination clauses set forth in W.S. 35-11-1610.</p>
                  <p>(c) The remedy and remediation standards for a site that are set forth in a remedy agreement shall be permanent, subject to the reopeners and termination clauses in W.S. 35-11-1610.</p>
                  <p>(d) Use restrictions, or other terms or conditions set forth in a remedy agreement shall run with the land and be binding upon successors in interest. If a term or condition of any remedy agreement, covenant not to sue, or certificate of completion requires the maintenance of a bond or other evidence of financial assurance, it shall be the duty of any successor in interest to maintain such bond or financial assurance.</p>
                  <p>(e) A violation of any use restriction, term or condition of a remedy agreement or certificate of completion shall be deemed a violation of this act, and the department may bring any action for such violation against the owner of the site at the time the violation occurs or against the person who violates the use restriction, term or condition of the remedy agreement or certificate of completion.</p>
                  <p>(f) No person shall change any engineering or institutional controls contained in a remedy agreement or certificate of completion without the prior written consent of the department. Before a change may be made, the department shall review the contamination at the site and any new requirements shall be incorporated into a subsequent remedy agreement or certificate of completion. Upon entry into a subsequent remedy agreement or certificate of completion or issuance of a no further action letter, the director shall modify or terminate any prior remedy agreement or certificate of completion.</p>
                  <p>(g) Consistent with the reopeners and termination clauses in W.S. 35-11-1610, the department shall, upon request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a covenant not to sue. Any covenant not to sue shall extend to subsequent owners.</p>
                  <p>(h) If the director determines that all remediation requirements for a site have been successfully implemented or satisfied, the department shall, upon request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a certificate of completion.</p>
                  <p>(j) A person who receives a remedy agreement or certificate of completion under this section shall record a copy in the office of the county clerk with the deed for the site and shall file the copy in the office of the county clerk no later than ten (10) business days after the date the remedy agreement or certification of completion is signed.</p>
                  <p>(k) No remedy agreement for any site subject to a prior administrative or judicial order or permit which contains remedial requirements shall be effective until the order or permit has been modified to incorporate the terms of the remedy agreement. Modifications to orders or permits under this subsection shall be made using the procedures specified in the prior order or permit. Entry into a remedy agreement under this article shall not affect the duty of the site owner or operator to comply with any prior order or permit. Following modification of the order or permit as provided in this subsection, the owner shall comply with the modified order or permit.</p>

                  <p>(a) If the department determines that no further remediation is required on a site, the department shall, upon request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a no further action letter, subject to reopener or termination as provided in W.S. 35-11-1610. The department may only issue a no further action letter upon a finding by the department that the site does not require engineering or institutional controls or use restrictions to meet the standards specified in W.S. 35-11-1605(a)(ii).</p>
                  <p>(b) When the department has determined that monitored natural attenuation over a reasonable period of time is appropriate and that no exposure to contaminated media is reasonably expected during the period of natural attenuation, the department shall, upon request, provide the owner or prospective purchaser a no further action letter. The no further action letter may require that the current use of the property continue during the period of natural attenuation and also may require that testing be conducted to confirm that standards are met.</p>

                  <p>(a) The owner of a site who proposes long-term restrictions on the use of the site shall petition to the appropriate governmental entity or entities for the creation of a use control area to establish long-term restrictions on the use of the site.</p>
                  <p>(b) A use control area may be created or modified only upon the petition of the owner of a site, and notice and public hearing as provided in subsection (d) of this section, and shall include only the site, unless adjacent property owners consent.</p>
                  <p>(c) The petition to establish a use control area shall contain data, information and any remedy options required in a preliminary remediation agreement under W.S. 35-11-1606.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon submission of a petition for long term use restrictions, the governmental entity to whom the use area designation petition has been submitted shall cause the owner to give written notice of the petition to all surface owners of record of land contiguous to the site, and to publish notice of the petition and a public hearing once per week for four (4) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located. The notice shall identify the property, generally describe the petition and proposed use restrictions, direct that comments may be submitted to the governmental entity or entities to whom the petition has been submitted, and provide the date, time and place of a public hearing. The public hearing shall be held no sooner than thirty (30) days after the first publication of the notice. After the public hearing has been held, the governing board, commission or council shall vote upon the creation of the use control area in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and procedures.</p>
                  <p>No use control area shall be created except upon petition of the owner and a majority vote of the appropriate board, commission or council.</p>
                  <p>(e) The governmental entity to whom the use control area petition has been submitted shall approve or deny an owner's petition for a use control area within one hundred eighty (180) days after the petition is received. The owner and a governmental entity may agree to extend the time period in which the governmental entity is to vote upon the petition. The governmental entity may, on a vote taken within one hundred eighty (180) days after the petition is received, condition its vote approving the petition upon the owner's subsequent filing of the determination by the director that a remedy can be selected that meets the requirements of W.S. 35-11-1605 and is consistent with owner's petition.</p>
                  <p>(f) The restrictions in a use control area are enforceable by the issuing governmental entity by injunction, mandamus or abatement, in addition to any other remedies provided by law.</p>
                  <p>(g) Except as provided in subsection (e), nothing in this section shall contravene or limit the authority of any county, city or town to regulate and control the property under their jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>(h) The department shall not have the authority to require a governmental entity to adopt any zoning regulation or restriction applicable to a site as part of a remediation or response action or a remedy agreement.</p>
                  <p>(j) If the department has issued a no further action letter under W.S. 35-11-1608, then no use control area designation shall be required.</p>

                  <p>(a) There is created an orphan site remediation account. The director may expend funds contained within the account for the purpose of remediation of orphan sites and the performance of any other activity as defined in this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) As used in this section, orphan sites means:</p>
                  <p>(i) Sites where the department determines that there is no viable party that is responsible for causing or contributing to the contamination present at the site; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Sites where the department has issued a no further action letter, and where there is a subsequent discovery of contamination which was present at the site when the no further action letter was issued but:</p>
                  <p>(A) Was not known to the site owner or the department at the time the no further action letter was issued, provided that a comprehensive and complete site characterization was conducted by the owner;</p>
                  <p>(B) Is not the result of activities conducted on the site after the no further action letter was issued; and</p>
                  <p>(C) Does not constitute an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health or the environment which is being addressed by the holder of the no further action letter pursuant to a reopening of the no further action letter under W.S. 35-11-1610(b).</p>
                  <p>(iii) Spill sites, where the department determines that the person responsible for the spill cannot be identified, or where the department must take prompt action to prevent hazards to human health or the environment at a site where a responsible party fails to act promptly.</p>
                  <p>(c) The department may expend funds from this account to conduct site evaluations and testing, evaluate remedial measures, select remediation requirements, and construct, install, maintain and operate systems to remedy contamination in accordance with a remediation work plan prescribed by the director for the orphan site.</p>
                  <p>(d) The department may also expend funds from this account to pay for the orphan share of any removal or remedial action taken pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Control And Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq.), provided that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The department has participated in negotiations for, and concurs with, the orphan share allocation amount for the action; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Each responsible party to an action has agreed not to seek cost recovery from less than de minimus contributors in exchange for the state assumption of the orphan share cost.</p>
                  <p>(e) Revenue to the account shall include such monies which may be deposited in the account for use in remediation of orphan sites. The liability of the state to fulfill the requirements of this section is limited to the amount of funds available in the account.</p>
                  <p>(f) The department shall project an annual funding need for the identification, characterization, prioritization and remediation of contaminated orphan sites within the state and shall recommend a funding source adequate to meet the identified funding need.</p>
                  <p>(g) In any case under paragraph (b)(iii) of this section where the department expends funds to remediate or contain contamination resulting from a spill, and where the department has identified a responsible party, the responsible party shall reimburse the department in an amount equal to three (3) times the expenditure from the account. The attorney general shall bring suit to recover the reimbursement amount required in this subsection where recovery is deemed possible.</p>
                  <p>(h) The director may transfer funds in the account under W.S. 35-11-424(a) to the orphan site remediation account.</p>

These rules and regulations shall preempt county rules and regulations concerning financial assurances and shall be designed to provide adequate assurance that the permitted facilities will be properly reclaimed and decommissioned at the end of their useful life, upon revocation of a permit authorizing their operation or upon the happening of any event which causes operations to cease. The elements to consider when establishing adequate levels of financial assurance shall include credit worthiness, financial strength, credit history, credit rating and any other factors that reasonably bear upon the decision to accept a financial assurance. The financial assurance may be in any form acceptable to the council and may include a corporate guarantee, letter of credit, bond, deposit account or insurance policy.</p>
                <p>(f) In addition to the rules and regulations adopted under subsection (b) of this section, the council shall promulgate rules and regulations requiring applicants for facilities described in W.S. 35-12-102(a)(vii)(E), (F) and (G) to provide notice to record owners of mineral rights located on or under the lands where the proposed facility will be constructed. Such notice may include notice by publication.</p>

                <p>(a) Within forty-five (45) days from the date of completion of the hearing the council shall make complete findings, issue an opinion and render a decision upon the record, either granting or denying the application as filed, or granting it upon terms, conditions or modifications of the construction, operation or maintenance of the facility as the council deems appropriate. The council shall not consider the imposition of conditions which address impacts within the area of jurisdiction of any other regulatory agency in this state as described in the information provided in W.S. 35-12-110(b), unless the other regulatory agency requests that conditions be imposed. In considering the imposition of conditions requested by other agencies upon private lands, the council shall consider in the same manner and to the same extent any comments presented by an affected landowner. The council may consider direct or cumulative impacts not within the area of jurisdiction of another regulatory agency in this state. The council shall grant a permit either as proposed or as modified by the council if it finds and determines that:</p>

                <p>(b) No permit shall be granted if the application is incomplete.</p>
                <p>(c) If the council determines that the location of all or part of the proposed facility should be modified, it may condition its permit upon that modification, provided that the local governments, and persons residing therein, affected by the modification, have been given reasonable notice of the modification.</p>
                <p>(d) The council shall issue with its decision, an opinion stating in detail its reasons for the decision.

A copy of the decision shall be served upon each party.</p>
                <p>(e) A permit may be issued conditioned upon the applicant furnishing a bond to the division in an amount determined by the director from which local governments may recover expenditures in preparation for impact to be caused by a facility if the permit holder does not complete the facility proposed. The permit holder is not liable under the bond if the holder is prevented from completing the facility proposed by circumstances beyond his control.</p>
                <p>(f) Within ten (10) days from the date of the council's decision, a copy of the findings and the council's decision shall be served upon the applicant, parties to the hearing and local governments to be substantially affected by the proposed facility and filed with the county clerk of the county or counties to be primarily affected by the proposed facility.

                <p>(i) A minimum of ten dollars ($10.00) per short ton of solid wastes, including radioactive wastes, received at the facility, less a minimum of five dollars ($5.00) for each short ton of solid wastes removed at the facility and recycled or reused and less any amount credited against the surcharge pursuant to W.S. 35-11-503(b)(iv)(B); and</p>

                <p>The license may be revoked by the department at any time if any of the conditions necessary for the issuing of or contained in the license are not complied with, or if any condition previously met ceases to be complied with. Any such revocation may be made by the department without notice or hearing, if the department determines that an emergency exists and that it is not practical, in relationship to its obligation to protect the public health, morals and welfare, to permit the licensee to proceed to hold the assembly. In any such case, however, the licensee may, within a period of three (3) days from and after revocation, apply or petition the department for an administrative hearing to show cause why the revocation should not be set aside and the licensee permitted to proceed to hold the assembly. In any such case, the department shall set any such application or petition down for hearing, and said matter shall be heard in the nature of a contested case proceeding under the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

The attorney general shall represent the department and shall bring a civil action in the name of the state of Wyoming in the district court of the county where the violation occurred or the threat with respect to holding the assembly exists or in the United States district court for the district of Wyoming if it otherwise has jurisdiction to obtain a court restraining order or injunction against the holding of the assembly. Any suit filed by the department shall be advanced for trial and heard and determined as expeditiously as feasible by the court. If the court should grant injunctive relief and thereafter find the person in contempt of the court's order, the court may invoke the bond filed by the person with the department in payment of any fine or forfeiture imposed in a contempt proceeding.</p>

                <p>(iv) The mobile home manufacturer or dealer shall take corrective action for any defect which constitutes an imminent safety hazard under applicable federal mobile home construction and safety standards for which the mobile home owner has given notice to the manufacturer or dealer. The mobile home manufacturer or dealer shall bring the mobile home into compliance with applicable standards and correct the defect or have the defect corrected within a reasonable period of time at the site of the mobile home without charge to the owner, but only if:</p>

                <p>(vi) The manufacturer and dealer shall be jointly and severally liable to the buyer for the fulfillment of the terms of warranty, and the buyer may give notice to either one (1) or both of the defect. Notice to either the manufacturer or dealer shall be considered notice to both the manufacturer and dealer. The address and the phone number of where to mail or deliver written notices for both the manufacturer and dealer shall be set forth in the warranty; and</p>
                <p>(vii) If during any period of time after notification of a defect the mobile home is unhabitable because of the defect, that period of time shall not be considered part of the one (1) year warranty period.</p>
                <p>(b) Any transfer of a mobile home from one (1) owner or lessee to another during the effective period of the warranty does not terminate the warranty, and subsequent owners or lessees shall be entitled to the full protection of the warranty for the duration of the warranty period as if the original owner or lessee had not transferred the mobile home.</p>

                <p>(a) When a vulnerable adult needs protective services and the caregiver refuses to allow the provision of those services, the department, through the attorney general or the district attorney, may petition the court for an order enjoining the caregiver from interfering with the provision of protective services.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>35-20-107. Emergency services.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) If an emergency exists and the department has reasonable cause to believe that a vulnerable adult is suffering from abuse, neglect, self neglect, exploitation, intimidation or abandonment and lacks the capacity to consent to the provision of protective services, the department, through the attorney general or the district attorney, may petition the court for an order for emergency protective services.</p>
                <p>(b) The court shall give notice to the vulnerable adult who is the subject of the petition at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the hearing. The court may dispense with notice if it finds that immediate or reasonably foreseeable physical harm to the vulnerable adult will result from the twenty-four (24) hour delay and that reasonable attempts have been made to give notice.</p>
                <p>(c) The allegations of the petition shall be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. If the court finds that the vulnerable adult has been or is being abused, neglected, exploited, intimidated or abandoned, or is committing self neglect, that an emergency exists and that the vulnerable adult lacks the capacity to consent to the provision of services, the court may order the department to provide protective services on an emergency basis. The court shall order only those services necessary to remove the conditions creating the emergency and shall specifically designate the authorized services. The order for emergency protective services shall remain in effect for a period not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours, excluding weekends and holidays. The order may be extended for up to an additional thirty (30) day period if the court finds that the extension is necessary to remove the emergency. The vulnerable adult, his agent, his court appointed representative or the department, through the attorney general or the district attorney, may petition the court to set aside or modify the order at any time.</p>
                <p>(d) The vulnerable adult may be placed by the court in a hospital or other suitable facility which is appropriate under the circumstances. The person, hospital or facility in whose care the vulnerable adult is placed shall immediately notify the person responsible for the care and custody of the vulnerable adult, if known, of the placement. Notification shall not be required if the alleged perpetrator is the person responsible for the care and custody of the vulnerable adult unless the court orders the notification.</p>

The court may issue the injunction if it finds that the person whose duty it is to investigate the report is acting within the scope of his duty and has been unreasonably denied access to the vulnerable adult.</p>

Names of other vulnerable adults shall be redacted from the records prior to disclosure pursuant to this subsection.

                <p>(a) Upon appropriate application and for employee or volunteer screening purposes, the department shall provide to any employer or entity whose employees or volunteers may have unsupervised access to vulnerable adults in the course of their employment or volunteer service a record summary concerning abuse, neglect, exploitation or abandonment of a vulnerable adult involving a named individual or shall confirm that no record exists. The state agency shall provide the results of the records check to the applicant by certified mail if the records check confirms the existence of a report "under investigation" or a "substantiated" finding of abuse or neglect. Otherwise, the state agency shall provide the results of the records check to the applicant in accordance with agency rules and by United States mail. The written results shall confirm that there is a report "under investigation", a "substantiated" finding of abuse or neglect on the central registry naming the individual or confirm that no record exists. When the individual is identified on the registry as a "substantiated" perpetrator of abuse or neglect, the report to the applicant shall contain information with respect to the date of the finding, specific type of abuse or neglect, a copy of the perpetrator's voluntary statement and whether an appeal is pending. Any applicant receiving a report under this section identifying an individual as "under investigation" shall be notified by the department as to the final disposition of that investigation and whether an appeal is pending. The applicant, or an agent on behalf of the applicant, shall submit a fee of not to exceed ten dollars ($10.00) as established by the department and proof satisfactory to the department that the prospective or current employee or volunteer whose records are being checked consents to the release of the information to the applicant. The applicant shall use the information received only for purposes of screening prospective or current employees and volunteers who may, through their employment or volunteer services, have unsupervised access to vulnerable adults.</p>
                <p>Applicants, their employees or other agents shall not otherwise divulge or make public any information received under this section. The department shall notify any applicant receiving information under this subsection of any subsequent reclassification of the information pursuant to W.S. 35-20-115(c). The department shall screen all prospective employees in conformity with the procedure provided under this subsection.</p>
                <p>(b) There is created a program administration account to be known as the child and vulnerable adult abuse registry account. All fees collected under subsection (a) of this section shall be credited to this account.</p>
                <p>(c) Any person may request a central registry screen and summary report on themselves as provided by subsection (a) of this section upon payment of the fee required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                <p>(a) Upon finding that an act of domestic abuse has occurred, the court shall enter an order of protection ordering the respondent household member to refrain from abusing the petitioner or any other household member. The order shall specifically describe the behavior that the court has ordered the respondent to do or refrain from doing. As a part of any order of protection, the court may:</p>
                <p>(i) Grant sole possession of the residence or household to the petitioner during the period the order of protection is effective or order the respondent to provide temporary suitable alternative housing for petitioner and any children to whom the respondent owes a legal obligation of support;</p>
                <p>(ii) Repealed by Laws 1987, ch. 196, § 2.</p>
                <p>(iii) Order that the respondent shall not initiate contact with the petitioner;</p>
                <p>(iv) Prohibit the respondent from abducting, removing or concealing any child in the custody of the petitioner;</p>
                <p>(v) Restrain the respondent from transferring, concealing, encumbering or otherwise disposing of petitioner's property or the joint property of the parties;</p>
                <p>(vi) Order other injunctive relief as the court deems necessary for the protection of the petitioner;</p>
                <p>(vii) If, after a hearing, it finds by a preponderance of evidence that an act of domestic abuse has occurred or that there exists a danger of further domestic abuse, require the respondent to participate in counseling or other appropriate treatment for a specified period of time not to exceed the term of the order of protection and any extension of the order of protection granted under W.S. 35-21-106(b);</p>
                <p>(viii) If the petitioner is not the account holder, grant the petitioner and order a provider to transfer to the petitioner the sole right to use and sole financial responsibility for a telephone number used by the petitioner or a minor child in the petitioner's custody and terminate in the provider's system the respondent's ability to use, and to access any data associated with, the telephone number. An order issued under this paragraph shall list the name and billing telephone number of the account holder, the name and contact information of the petitioner and each telephone number to be transferred to the petitioner. In issuing an order under this paragraph, the court shall ensure that the petitioner's contact information is not disclosed to the respondent or any account holder. The order shall be served on the provider pursuant to W.S. 35-21-106(e). A provider may, not later than five (5) business days after being served with an order under this paragraph, notify the petitioner and the court that compliance with the order is not possible or practicable because an account holder named in the order has terminated the account, differences in network technology would prevent the functionality of a device on the network or there are geographic limitations on network or service availability. In complying with an order issued under this paragraph, a provider may apply any customary requirements for establishing an account and transferring a telephone number. A provider is immune from civil liability for complying with an order issued under this paragraph;</p>
                <p>(ix) Grant sole possession of any household pet, as defined in W.S. 6-3-203(o), owned, possessed or kept by the petitioner, the respondent or a minor child residing in the residence or household of either the petitioner or the respondent to the petitioner during the period the order of protection is effective if the order is for the purpose of protecting the household pet;</p>
                <p>(x) Order that the respondent shall not have contact with any household pet, as defined in W.S. 6-3-203(o), in the custody of the petitioner and prohibit the respondent from abducting, removing, concealing or disposing of the household pet if the order is for the purpose of protecting the household pet.</p>
                <p>(b) As part of any order of protection pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the court shall:</p>
                <p>(i) When the court finds it to be in the best interests of the children, award temporary custody of any children involved to the petitioner. The court shall in this instance provide for visitation with the respondent only if adequate provision can be made for the safety of the children and the petitioner. To provide for the safety of the children and the petitioner, the court may:</p>
                <p>(A) Order an exchange of children to occur in a protected setting;</p>
                <p>(B) Order that visitation be arranged and supervised by another person or agency, and if the other person is a family or household member, establish conditions to be followed during the visitation;</p>
                <p>(C) Order the respondent to attend and complete to the court's satisfaction a program of intervention or other designated counseling as a condition of visitation;</p>
                <p>(D) Order the respondent to abstain from the consumption of alcohol or controlled substances for up to twenty-four (24) hours before the visitation and during the visitation;</p>
                <p>(E) Order the respondent to pay a fee through the court to defray the costs of supervised visitation;</p>
                <p>(F) Prohibit overnight visitation;</p>
                <p>(G) Require the respondent to post a bond to secure the return and safety of any children; or</p>
                <p>(H) Impose any other condition it deems necessary for the safety of the petitioner, the children, or other family or household member.</p>
                <p>(ii) Order the payment of child support and when appropriate, temporary support for the petitioner;</p>
                <p>(iii) Order the payment of any medical costs incurred by the petitioner as a result of the abuse inflicted by the respondent.</p>
                <p>(c) The order shall contain a notice that willful violation of any provision of the order constitutes a crime as defined by W.S. 6-4-404, can result in immediate arrest and may result in further punishment. Orders shall also contain notice that a violation that constitutes the offense of stalking as defined by W.S. 6-2-506(b) may subject the perpetrator to enhanced penalties for felony stalking under W.S. 6-2-506(e).</p>
                <p>(d) No order issued under this act shall affect title to any property nor allow the petitioner to transfer, conceal, encumber or otherwise dispose of respondent's property or the joint property of the parties.</p>
                <p>(e) Regardless of whether the court provides visitation under subsection (b) of this section, the court shall, if requested by the petitioner, order the address of the petitioner and any children of the petitioner and respondent be kept confidential.</p>
                <p>(f) The court may refer an adult petitioner to attend counseling relating to the petitioner's status or behavior as a victim but shall not order or make as a condition of receiving protection that an adult petitioner attend such counseling.</p>
                <p>(g) No act of the petitioner or the respondent may be construed to waive or nullify any provision of an order of protection.</p>
                <p>(h) The court shall not make any provisions of a single order of protection mutually effective. The court may issue a separate order of protection to each party, provided:</p>
                <p>(i) Each party has filed a separate written petition for an order of protection; and</p>
                <p>(ii) The court makes specific findings on the record that both parties have committed acts of domestic abuse and that each party is entitled to a separate order of protection.</p>
                <p>(j) The form of the order shall be as provided by rule adopted by the Wyoming supreme court.</p>

The motion may be accompanied with all relevant affidavits or documents to establish that the person requesting confidentiality is a victim of domestic abuse and that the person may be subject to additional acts of domestic abuse if confidentiality is not maintained.</p>
                <p>(c) Upon a filing of a motion pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the court shall issue an order prohibiting the release of the address, city and state of residence and any other information identifying the residence of a person if:</p>

The power remains in effect notwithstanding the principal's later incapacity and may include individual instructions. Unless related to the principal by blood, marriage or adoption, an agent may not be an owner, operator or employee of a residential or community care facility at which the principal is receiving care. The durable power of attorney must be acknowledged before a notarial officer or must be signed by at least two (2) witnesses, each of whom witnessed either the signing of the instrument by the principal or the principal's acknowledgement of the signature or of the instrument, each witness making the following declaration in substance:</p>

                  <p>(e) Unless otherwise specified in a written advance health care directive, a determination that an individual lacks or has recovered capacity, or that another condition exists that affects an individual instruction or the authority of an agent, shall be made by the primary physician, but the treating primary health care provider may make the decision if the primary physician is unavailable.</p>

                  <p>(c) If none of the individuals eligible to act as surrogate under subsection (b) of this section is reasonably available, an adult who has exhibited special care and concern for the patient, who is familiar with the patient's personal values, and who is reasonably available may act as surrogate.</p>
                  <p>(d) A surrogate shall communicate his assumption of authority as promptly as practicable to the members of the patient's family specified in subsection (b) of this section who can be readily contacted.</p>
                  <p>(e) If more than one (1) member of a class assumes authority to act as surrogate, and the other members of the class do not agree on a health care decision and the primary health care provider is so informed, the primary health care provider shall comply with the decision of a majority of the members of that class who have communicated their views to the provider.</p>
                  <p>(f) A surrogate shall make a health care decision in accordance with the patient's individual instructions, if any, and other wishes to the extent known to the surrogate. Otherwise, the surrogate shall make the decision in accordance with the surrogate's determination of the patient's best interest. In determining the patient's best interest, the surrogate shall consider the patient's personal, philosophical, religious and ethical values to the extent known to the surrogate and reliable oral or written statements previously made by the patient, including, but not limited to, statements made to family members, friends, health care providers or religious leaders.</p>
                  <p>(g) A health care decision made by a surrogate for a patient is effective without judicial approval.</p>
                  <p>(h) The patient at any time may disqualify another, including a member of the individual's family, from acting as the individual's surrogate by a signed writing or by personally informing the primary health care provider of the disqualification.</p>
                  <p>(j) Unless related to the patient by blood, marriage or adoption, a surrogate may not be an owner, operator or employee of a residential or community care facility at which the patient is receiving care.</p>
                  <p>(k) A primary health care provider may require an individual claiming the right to act as surrogate for a patient to provide a written declaration under penalty of perjury stating facts and circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the claimed authority.</p>

                  <p>(b) A primary health care provider who knows of the existence of an advance health care directive, a revocation of an advance health care directive, or a designation or disqualification of a surrogate, shall promptly record its existence in the patient's health care record and, if it is in writing, shall request a copy and if one is furnished shall arrange for its maintenance in the health care record.</p>
                  <p>(c) The primary physician who makes or is informed of a determination that a patient lacks or has recovered capacity, or that another condition exists which affects an individual instruction or the authority of an agent, guardian or surrogate, shall promptly record the determination in the patient's health care record and communicate the determination to the patient, if possible, and to any person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient.</p>
                  <p>(d) Except as provided in subsections (e) and (f) of this section, a health care provider or institution providing care to a patient shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Comply with an individual instruction of the patient and with a reasonable interpretation of that instruction made by a person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Comply with a health care decision for the patient made by a person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient to the same extent as if the decision had been made by the patient while having capacity.</p>
                  <p>(e) A health care provider may decline to comply with an individual instruction or health care decision for reasons of conscience. A health care institution may decline to comply with an individual instruction or health care decision if the instruction or decision is contrary to a written policy of the institution which is expressly based on reasons of conscience and if the policy was timely communicated to the patient or to a person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient. The institution shall deliver the written policy upon receipt of the patient's advance directive that may conflict with the policy or upon notice from the primary health care provider that the patient's instruction or decision may be in conflict with the health care institution's policy.</p>
                  <p>(f) A health care provider or institution may decline to comply with an individual instruction or health care decision that requires medically ineffective health care or health care contrary to generally accepted health care standards applicable to the health care provider or institution.</p>
                  <p>(g) A health care provider or institution that declines to comply with an individual instruction or health care decision shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Promptly so inform the patient, if possible, and any person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Provide continuing care, including continuing life sustaining care, to the patient until a transfer can be effected; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Unless the patient or person then authorized to make health care decisions for the patient refuses assistance, immediately make all reasonable efforts to assist in the transfer of the patient to another health care provider or institution that is willing to comply with the instruction or decision.</p>
                  <p>(h) A health care provider or institution may not require or prohibit the execution or revocation of an advance health care directive as a condition for providing health care.</p>

                  <p>(a) The provider orders for life sustaining treatment (POLST) program is a process of evaluation and communication between a patient, or the patient's agent, guardian or surrogate, and health care professionals in order to:</p>
                  <p>(i) Ensure that health care providers understand the desires of the patient, or the patient’s agent, guardian or surrogate, regarding medical treatment as the patient nears the end of life;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Convert the patient's goals and preferences for care into a set of medical orders on a POLST form that is portable across care settings to be complied with by all health professionals; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Provide the patient and the patient's agent, guardian or surrogate, if any, with a copy of the completed POLST form.</p>

                  <p>(c) If a patient who lacks capacity has not executed a valid advance directive or a valid POLST form, a surrogate may execute a POLST form on behalf of the patient as provided in W.S. 35-22-406. If a valid advance directive or POLST form executed by the patient forbids changes by a surrogate, a surrogate shall not execute or change a POLST form on behalf of the patient.</p>

                <p>(iii) If the person fails to complete the educational or training program or fails to return to the employ of the state, he shall be required to immediately repay the educational assistance loan and any unearned salary provided by the department for attendance in the educational or training program;</p>
                <p>(iv) Any other provision the department deems necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes of the program.</p>
                <p>(b) The department is authorized to enter into agreements with health professionals who have completed a health care educational or training program from an accredited university or community college program to provide immediate relief for health professional position vacancies in the state.

                <p>(a) It is the policy of the state to promote:</p>
                <p>(i) The quality of health care provided to the citizens of Wyoming;</p>
                <p>(ii) Access to appropriate health care for all citizens of the state, including citizens in historically underserved populations and underserved geographic areas;</p>
                <p>(iii) Containment of health care costs; and</p>
                <p>(iv) A comprehensive health care system in the state.</p>
                <p>(b) The legislature finds that the policies specified under subsection (a) of this section will be significantly enhanced by cooperative arrangements including joint ventures and similar enterprises, and contracts among health care providers and purchasers, and certain collaborative agreements between third party payors and health care providers, that might otherwise be prohibited by federal and state antitrust laws if undertaken without governmental involvement. The legislature declares that the formation and operation of cooperative arrangements be the subject of government regulation by the state and that state regulation be substituted for the marketplace and market competition. The legislature intends by provisions of this chapter, that approval of cooperative arrangements among health care providers, purchasers and third party payors be accompanied by appropriate conditions and ongoing supervision and regulation of the operations of the cooperative arrangements, in order to protect against any abuses and to effectively except the actions of approved and regulated cooperative arrangements from state and federal antitrust liability.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>35-24-111. Criteria for approving application; factors enumerated.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) The director shall not approve an application unless he determines the arrangement is more likely to result in a better overall promotion of the quality of health care, access to health care, a lower cost for health care and the increased availability of a comprehensive health care system in the state, than would otherwise occur under existing market conditions or conditions likely to develop without an exemption from state and federal antitrust law. If a proposed arrangement appears likely to improve certain criteria at the expense of other criteria, the director shall not approve the application unless he determines improvements outweigh the negative impacts and the proposed arrangement, taken as a whole, is likely to substantially further the purposes of this chapter.</p>
                <p>(b) In making a determination about cost, access, quality and the promotion of a comprehensive health care system in the state, the director may to the extent applicable, require the applicant to demonstrate or provide information for purposes of considering:</p>
                <p>(i) If the proposal includes provisions for cost containment;</p>
                <p>(ii) Market structure, including:</p>
                <p>(A) Actual and potential sellers and buyers or providers and purchasers;</p>
                <p>(B) Actual and potential consumers;</p>
                <p>(C) Geographic market area; and</p>
                <p>(D) Entry conditions.</p>
                <p>(iii) Current market conditions;</p>
                <p>(iv) The historical behavior of the market;</p>
                <p>(v) Performance of other similar arrangements;</p>
                <p>(vi) If the proposal unnecessarily restrains competition or restrains competition in ways not reasonably related to the purposes of this chapter; and</p>
                <p>(vii) The financial condition of the applicant.</p>
                <p>(c) The analysis of cost by the director shall consider the individual consumer of health care and if a proposed arrangement will result in cost-efficiencies in the services provided by the applicant. Cost-efficiencies to be realized by providers, group purchasers or other participants in the health care system also are relevant and shall be considered to the extent any efficiencies are likely to directly or indirectly benefit the consumer. If an application is submitted by providers primarily paid by third party payors or persons unaffiliated with the applicant, it is sufficient for the applicant to show that cost savings are likely to be passed on to the unaffiliated third party payors or persons and the applicants shall not be required to show that third party payors with whom the applicants are not affiliated will pass on cost savings to individuals receiving coverage through the third party payors. To the extent relevant and ascertainable, cost analysis may also include the impact on overall employer premiums for health insurance. In making determinations as to costs, the director shall determine the extent to which:</p>
                <p>(i) The cost savings likely to result to the applicant;</p>
                <p>(ii) The extent to which cost savings are likely to be passed on to the consumer and in what form;</p>
                <p>(iii) The extent to which overall employer premium costs for health insurance will be decreased;</p>
                <p>(iv) The extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to result in cost shifting by the applicant onto other payors or purchasers of other products or services;</p>
                <p>(v) The extent to which any cost shifting by the applicant is likely to be followed by other persons in the market;</p>
                <p>(vi) The extent to which the proposed arrangement reduces overall systemic cost shifting;</p>
                <p>(vii) The current and anticipated supply and demand for any products or services at issue;</p>
                <p>(viii) The representations and guarantees of the applicant and their enforceability;</p>
                <p>(ix) Effectiveness of regulation by the director;</p>
                <p>(x) Inferences to be drawn from market structure;</p>
                <p>(xi) The cost of regulation, both for the state and for the applicant; and</p>
                <p>(xii) Any other factors showing that the proposed arrangement is or is not likely to reduce costs.</p>
                <p>(d) In making determinations as to access, the director shall determine the extent to which the:</p>
                <p>(i) Utilization of needed health care services or products by the intended targeted population is likely to increase or decrease. When a proposed arrangement is likely to increase access in one (1) geographic area by lowering prices or otherwise expanding supply, but limits access in another geographic area by removing service capabilities from that second area, the director shall require the applicant to articulate the criteria employed to balance these effects;</p>
                <p>(ii) Proposed arrangement is likely to make available a new and needed service or product to a certain geographic area;</p>
                <p>(iii) Proposed arrangement is likely to otherwise make health care services or products more financially or geographically available to consumers, particularly persons in historically underserved populations including indigent persons and unserved geographic areas; and</p>
                <p>(iv) Proposed arrangement is likely to result in a wide distribution of appropriate health care services throughout the state.</p>
                <p>(e) If the director determines that the proposed arrangement is likely to increase access and bases that determination on a projected increase in utilization, the director shall require the applicant to demonstrate that the increased utilization does not result in overutilization.</p>
                <p>(f) In making determinations as to quality, the director shall determine the extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to:</p>
                <p>(i) Decrease morbidity and mortality;</p>
                <p>(ii) Result in faster convalescence;</p>
                <p>(iii) Result in fewer hospital days;</p>
                <p>(iv) Permit providers to attain needed experience or frequency of treatment likely to lead to better outcomes;</p>
                <p>(v) Result in more effective or efficient provider credentialing and licensing;</p>
                <p>(vi) Result in increased or more effective use of clinical practice guidelines, quality assurance measures such as continued quality improvement and other outcome measurements;</p>
                <p>(vii) Increase patient satisfaction; and</p>
                <p>(viii) Have any other features likely to improve or reduce the quality of health care.</p>
                <p>(g) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, in evaluating if a proposed arrangement improves or reduces the quality of health care, the director shall preserve the confidentiality of quality management functions involving health care facilities and peer review activities involving professional standard review organizations as set forth in W.S. 35-2-910 and 35-17-101 through 35-17-106.</p>
                <p>(h) In making determinations as to whether a proposed arrangement contributes to the promotion of a comprehensive health care system in the state, the director shall determine the extent to which the arrangement is likely to:</p>
                <p>(i) Promote the development of and access to a wide variety of health care services and specialties in the state;</p>
                <p>(ii) Minimize cost-shifting in which more lucrative patient populations and specialties are served at the expense of other patients and specialties, resulting in fewer services available in the state; and</p>
                <p>(iii) Promote access to appropriate health care services in locations throughout the state.</p>

                <p>(a) The director shall issue a written decision approving or disapproving the application.</p>
                <p>(b) The director may condition approval on a modification of all or part of the proposed arrangement to eliminate any restriction on competition that is not reasonably related to the goals of reducing cost or improving access or quality. The director may also establish conditions for approval that are reasonably necessary to protect against abuses of private economic power and to ensure that the arrangement is appropriately supervised and regulated by the state.</p>
                <p>(c) The decision by the director approving or disapproving an application shall include specific findings of fact concerning cost, access and quality criteria and shall identify one (1) or more of these criteria as the basis for the decision.</p>
                <p>(d) The decision to approve an application shall require periodic submission of specific data by the applicant relating to cost, access and quality and to the extent feasible, the applicant shall identify objective standards of cost, access and quality by which the success of the arrangement will be measured. If the director determines that the scope of a particular proposed arrangement is such that the arrangement is certain to have neither a positive or negative impact on any one (1) of the criteria, the director may not require the submission of data or establish an objective standard relating to that criteria. An applicant shall submit a renewal fee together with information required under this subsection, in an amount determined by the department subject to limitations imposed under W.S. 35-24-104(d). Revenues from fees collected shall be deposited into the account established under W.S. 35-24-104(d).</p>

                <p>(b) The decision approving the application shall specify a time schedule for the submission of data by the applicant, which shall be at least once a year and shall identify the data required to be submitted. The director may at any time require the submission of additional data or alter the time schedule. Upon review of the data submitted, the director shall notify the applicant on compliance of the arrangement with the initial decision or subsequent orders.

                <p>(c) An applicant receiving notification that an arrangement is not in compliance may respond with additional data within thirty (30) days. The response may include a proposal and time schedule by which the applicant will bring the arrangement into compliance with the initial decision or subsequent orders. If the arrangement is not in compliance and the director and the applicant cannot agree to the terms of bringing the arrangement into compliance, the matter shall be set for hearing. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in the manner prescribed under W.S. 35-24-110.

                <p><shortTitle>35-24-115. Revocation of approval; conditions; notice; public comment; hearing; revocation alternatives specified; liability of applicant.</shortTitle></p>
                <p>(a) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the director shall revoke his initial approval of an application if the arrangement:</p>
                <p>(i) Is not in substantial compliance with the terms of the application;</p>
                <p>(ii) Is not in substantial compliance with the conditions of approval;</p>
                <p>(iii) Has not and is not likely to substantially achieve improvements in cost, access or quality or the promotion of a comprehensive health care system in the state as identified in the initial decision as the basis for approval of the arrangement; or</p>
                <p>(iv) Is not promoting reductions in cost and improvements in access and quality to the extent competition would do so due to changing conditions in the marketplace. Revocation under this paragraph shall be identified in writing by the director together with reasons therefor.</p>
                <p>(b) The director shall initiate a proceeding to revoke approval by providing written notice to the applicant describing in detail the basis for the proposed revocation. Notice of the proceeding shall be published and provided to all interested parties in the manner and time specified under W.S. 35-24-104(b), which shall request the submission of comments to the director.</p>
                <p>(c) A proceeding to revoke an approval shall be conducted as a contested case proceeding upon the written request of the applicant. The attorney general may appear as a party. The contested hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by W.S. 35-24-110. Decisions of the director in a proceeding to revoke approval are subject to judicial review in accordance with W.S. 16-3-114.</p>
                <p>(d) In deciding whether to revoke an approval, the director shall consider the hardship the revocation may impose on the applicant and any potential disruption of the market as a whole. The director shall also consider based upon a demonstration by the applicant, if the arrangement can be modified, restructured or regulated in a manner to remedy the problem upon which the revocation proceeding is based. Before approving an alternative to revocation that involves modifying or restructuring an arrangement, the director shall publish notice stating that any person may comment on the proposed modification or restructuring within twenty (20) days after publication of the notice. The director shall not approve any modification or restructuring until the comment period has concluded. An approved modified or restructured arrangement is subject to appropriate supervision in the manner provided under W.S. 35-24-114.</p>
                <p>(e) An applicant that has had its approval revoked is not required to terminate the arrangement. The applicant cannot be held liable under state or federal antitrust law for acts that occurred while the approval was in effect, except to the extent the applicant failed to substantially comply with terms of its application or failed to substantially comply with terms of the approval. The applicant is subject to state and federal antitrust law after the revocation becomes effective and may be held liable for acts that occur after the revocation.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to approval of the state plan by the United States secretary of health and human services, and subject to available state and federal funding the department shall provide a health insurance plan for an eligible child whose monthly gross family income is not more than two hundred percent (200%) of the federal poverty level. A child who is determined eligible to receive benefits under this section shall remain eligible for twelve (12) months as long as the child resides in the state of Wyoming and has not yet attained nineteen (19) years of age. A child's eligibility to receive benefits under this act shall be redetermined on an annual basis. A simplified application process, which includes minimum eligibility requirements, shall be provided throughout the state at various public and private establishments approved by the department of health. To be determined eligible to receive benefits under this section, a child shall not be eligible under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act, shall not have been covered under another health insurance plan for a minimum of one (1) month prior to application for coverage under this act or, upon birth, the child would not otherwise be covered by a public or private health insurance plan. Eligibility under this section shall be determined by the department of health or its designee.</p>

If the child health insurance plan required by subsection (a) of this section is provided through the department's division, the department shall competitively procure the contract at least once every five (5) years. In awarding the contract the department shall compare the cost of operating the program through a private insurance company to a forecasted state administered alternative.</p>
                  <p>(c) A medical provider who accepts payment for services provided under this section shall not charge or attempt to collect payments in excess of a rate schedule established by the department or in excess of rates negotiated with a private health insurance company who is offering child health insurance pursuant to this act.</p>

                  <p>(a) Subject to the availability of appropriations, the department shall undertake a colorectal cancer screening and prevention program for those who qualify as specified in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(b) Initially the screening and prevention program funded under this program shall consist of colonoscopies which shall consist of both the examination of the colon and rectum and the removal and pathological examination of polyps in accordance with the normal standards of care for colonoscopies. After July 1, 2008, the department may, by rule and regulation, authorize other forms of screening to participate in the program provided these other forms of screening are evidence based and are shown by the evidence to be as effective or as cost effective as traditional colonoscopies.</p>
                  <p>(c) Starting July 1, 2007 Wyoming residents with incomes at or below two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level shall be eligible to participate in this program and this shall remain the standard if the biennial budget bill does not establish a different standard and unless a different standard is established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) Eligibility for the program set forth in this section shall be limited to individuals who are Wyoming residents and have been so for at least one (1) year immediately prior to screening. The eligibility shall be for one (1) colonoscopy every ten (10) years, counting any done before the effective date of this act or before the individual became a Wyoming resident. However, the department on a case-by-case basis may authorize follow-up screening when medically indicated based on national evidence based guidelines. Eligibility shall be restricted to individuals who are at least fifty (50) years old and who have not become eligible for the federal Medicare program. In the event that analysis shows spending in the program will exceed the budget available, the department shall institute a waiting list.</p>
                  <p>(e) The department shall provide vouchers to eligible persons for reimbursement for a colonoscopy at the rate paid under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act for colonoscopies, including polyp removal. The person receiving a voucher under this subsection shall pay all other costs of the colonoscopy. When the funds appropriated for this program are expended, the department shall cease issuing vouchers under this section.</p>
                  <p>(f) The department shall develop an internet based application process for determining individual eligibility. The result of a successful application may be a voucher that the individual may present to a provider the department has contracted with or may be an online statement of eligibility that the providers can access or both. The department may use city or county health departments, other public health offices, providers, advocacy groups and any other appropriate governmental or private entities to assist individuals in completing the application process.</p>

                <p>(a) There is created the public health nursing infant home visitation subprogram.</p>
                <p>(b) Pregnant women, or families with infants, are eligible for services of the program if:</p>
                <p>(i) The delivery of the newborn or the prenatal care is paid for, or is eligible to be paid for, under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act or the woman is eligible for services under the women's, infants' and children's supplemental food program;</p>
                <p>(ii) The mother is confined to a county jail, the Wyoming women's center or any other correctional facility in the state, or is on probation or parole as a result of a conviction of a criminal offense;</p>
                <p>(iii) The mother has a mental illness or substance abuse problem and is an inpatient at the Wyoming state hospital, a psychiatric hospital or an inpatient treatment facility, or is referred for services by a community mental health center; or</p>

                <p>(d) The program shall:</p>
                <p>(i) To the extent practical and needed, provide prenatal contacts and follow-up contacts with each eligible pregnant woman. If another agency or program is actually performing adequate prenatal contacts, the program created under this act shall defer to that agency or program, or develop an agreement on a county by county or region by region basis as to which program will provide the contacts to avoid duplication;</p>
                <p>(ii) To the extent needed where there were prenatal contacts, and to the extent practical where adequate contact was not made with the eligible mother prior to delivery, as soon as practical after the mother and infant return to their home, conduct a welcome home visit for the infant in the family home. During the welcome home visit, the public health nurse may, as appropriate:</p>
                <p>(A) Provide information in written, audio or video format on the care and nurturing of infants;</p>
                <p>(B) Provide information on recommended immunizations;</p>

                <p>(e) The department shall:</p>
                <p>(i) Establish home visitation subprograms within available resources and shall initially use the following implementation priorities in case of shortage of resources:</p>
                <p>(A) First time pregnant women under the age of twenty (20) years who are eligible for assistance under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act or the women's, infants' and children's supplemental food program;</p>

                <p>(ii) Modify the priority list required under paragraph (i) of this subsection as needed;</p>
                <p>(iii) Develop or specify protocols for public health nurses to use in the program;</p>
                <p>(iv) Provide training for the nurses conducting the visits; and</p>
                <p>(v) Where a county or municipal health department or health district exists, contract with the governing body of that department or district:</p>
                <p>(A) For the provision of the program's services;</p>
                <p>or</p>
                <p>(B) To provide the public health nurses to conduct the program.</p>
                <p>(f) The department may subcontract with providers of research based, nonnurse models for home visiting services, as appropriate and indicated by client assessment, to secure the most effective services available for the eligible populations.</p>
                <p>(g) The public health nurses responsible for each county shall jointly for that county develop a list of programs, resources and providers to whom referrals may be made and the types of referrals that may be made to each entity.

                <p>(h) Any physician providing prenatal care or delivering a baby where the care or delivery is eligible for reimbursement under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act may, unless contraindicated, refer the expectant mother or the infant to the public health nurse serving the county for placement in the program. Physicians may refer other pregnant women, infants or families to the program as medically needed. The referrals shall begin once the program is operational within the county.</p>

                <p>(a) It shall be the goal of the program in each county to provide appropriate nursing contact to all eligible women. The department shall statistically track, in order to provide trending reports as needed, the number of known eligible births, the number receiving appropriate contacts, the number of women needing follow-up services and the number who did not receive follow-up services broken down by cause as follows:</p>
