                  <p>and</p>
                  <p>(G) Shall not represent themselves to be peace officers.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any franchise granted pursuant to subparagraph (a)(xxxiii)(C) of this section is subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The franchise agreement shall specify who is responsible for deliverability;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The distribution system shall continue to be a public utility whose charges are regulated by the public service commission. The charges shall reflect the reasonable nongas costs subject to management audit as the public service commission deems necessary plus a reasonable return on investment;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Any city or town or its authorized representative shall act as an agent for any person served by the system in negotiating terms and conditions for the supply of natural gas to that person, and the franchisee distribution system shall accept for delivery to any person served by the system, natural gas from any supplier;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The public service commission shall designate a place or places in the vicinity of the distribution system for the acceptance of natural gas not supplied by franchisee;</p>
                  <p>(v) The public service commission shall adopt and enforce minimum quality standards for all gas delivered to the distribution system. These standards shall reflect the practices of the operators of the distribution system unless good cause is shown for different standards. The standards shall be designed to facilitate the commingling of gas from different suppliers;</p>
                  <p>(vi) As soon as there are at least two (2) suppliers offering natural gas to all customers served by the franchisee and as soon as the additional supplier or suppliers are capable of delivering gas in at least one-third (1/3) of the volume required by the entire distribution system provided that the public service commission finds that the suppliers own or control, and have committed to guaranteed delivery, reserves of natural gas sufficient to supply ten (10) years of demand at that level, then all persons supplying gas shall have the authority to set their own prices. The proposed supplier has the burden of proving adequate reserves and deliverability. The Wyoming oil and gas commission shall report to the public service commission on the adequacy and deliverability when a utility gas supply is proposed to be displaced under this act;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Subject to the availability of pipeline capacity and the requirements of federal law and regulations the public service commission may, after notice and hearing if necessary, designate any point in the state on a gas pipeline operated for the purpose of delivering gas to the distribution system or its parent or subsidiary company as a point for receipt of gas to the system and regulate the charges for shipping gas from that point to the system. If a pipeline has insufficient capacity the public service commission consistent with W.S. 30-5-125 may require it to accept gas that has a lower price to the consumer in preference to higher price gas. The public service commission may impose any conditions or requirements pursuant to this subsection that are necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to ensure the efficient operation of the natural gas distribution and supply system and to ensure the lowest possible price to retail customers, including but not limited to proper assignment of costs of connecting suppliers to the system;</p>
                  <p>(viii) When a city renews or grants a franchise for the supply of natural gas under subparagraph (a)(xxxiii)(C) of this section, the public service commission may require that the distribution of gas in surrounding unincorporated areas also be made subject to the terms of the same franchise;</p>
                  <p>(ix) If a distribution system has only one (1) supplier of natural gas all prices charged in that franchise are subject to W.S. 37-2-121 and 37-2-122;</p>
                  <p>(x) All suppliers of gas to the distribution system shall annually report to the public service commission the annual consumption of natural gas by their customers of record at the date of the report and their natural gas reserves. If their natural gas reserves are less than a five (5) year supply, the public service commission may forbid any supplier from serving new customers until the reserves are equal to a five (5) year supply for all customers;</p>
                  <p>(xi) Any supplier entering the system under this subsection is liable for injuries, damages or other losses to the extent to which the injuries, damages or other losses are proximately caused by the supplier's operations within the system and are due to failure of the supplier to exercise that standard of care which a reasonable, prudent person would exercise under the same or similar circumstances to avoid an undue risk of harm or are due to the supplier's failure to deliver contracted amounts of natural gas.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any provision in a gas purchase contract which contains or creates an indefinite escalator clause, otherwise known as a "favored nation treaty" provision, is contrary to the public policy of the state and is void and unenforceable if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The contract is to sell gas to the holders of a municipality franchise which supplies retail customers in the state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The contract provides for the sale in the state of gas produced within the state;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The contract gas price is in excess of the general market price which would otherwise exist in the absence of the indefinite escalator clause; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The higher price resulting from the application of the escalator clause is not required by any enforceable provision of statutes or regulations enacted or adopted pursuant to the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 or other appropriate statutes and regulations of the United States.</p>
                  <p>(d) Before the governing body of a city or town enters into an agreement to borrow money from the United States of America or from the state of Wyoming, or from any subdivision, agency or department of either, to fund a public improvement project to be repaid solely from revenues generated by the enterprise with which the financed project is associated, the proposal to enter into the loan agreement shall be submitted to and approved by the electors of the city or town in the same manner and pursuant to the same procedures as provided for bond issues under the Political Subdivision Bond Election Law, if the total amount to be borrowed for the project exceeds the greater of:</p>
                  <p>(i) Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00); or</p>
                  <p>(ii) An amount calculated by multiplying the number of individuals to be served by the proposed public improvement project times one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00).</p>

For contracts in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00), cities, towns and joint powers boards may prequalify contractors who wish to submit bids or responses based on such criteria as the project type and experience, expertise, professional qualifications, past performance, staff proposed, schedule proposed, financial strength, qualification of supervisors proposed to be used, technical solutions proposed or references.</p>
                  <p>(d) Every contract shall be executed by the mayor or in his absence or disability, by the president or other presiding officer of the governing body and by the clerk or designee of the governing body. The successful bidder or respondent shall furnish to the city, town or joint powers board a bond or other form of guarantee in accordance with W.S. 16-6-112.</p>
                  <p>(e) Before advertising for a bid for any work on the construction of any public improvements and except as provided under W.S. 16-6-707 for alternate design and construction delivery methods, detailed plans and specifications shall be prepared, together with an estimate of the probable cost and a form of the proposed contract. A city, town or joint powers board may withhold a percentage of the calculated value of any work completed as retainage in accordance with W.S. 16-6-702(b). No progress payment may be made until the city or town engineer or designated local official has furnished the estimate, together with a certificate that the amount of work estimated to have been done conforms in all material respects with the requirements of the contract. A joint powers board may designate an official of any member city or town to perform the functions required by this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(f) In advertising for any bid, the forms of guarantee required under this section and approved by the city, town or joint powers board shall be specified. In addition, bidders shall be required to accompany each bid with a bid bond or if the bid is one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) or less, any other form of bid guarantee approved by the city, town or joint powers board, equal to at least five percent (5%) of the total bid amount, with sufficient surety and payable to the city, town or joint powers board. The bid guarantee shall be forfeited as liquidated damages if the bidder, upon the letting of the contract to him, fails to enter into the contract within thirty (30) days after it is presented to him for that purpose or fails to proceed with the performance of the contract. The bid guarantee shall be retained by the city, town or joint powers board until proper bond or other form of security satisfactory to the city, town or joint powers board to secure performance of the contract has been filed and approved. The right to reject any bid is reserved in all bid advertisements. All bids shall be numbered consecutively before they are opened and no further bids may be received after the advertised time of opening bids and any bid is publicly opened. The city, town or joint powers board shall give all persons who desire an opportunity to inspect all bids when they are opened. No bid may be considered unless accompanied by a bid guarantee in the required amount.</p>
                  <p>(g) No contract for which a bond or other form of financial guarantee approved by the city, town or joint powers board is required may be assigned or transferred in any manner except by operation of law or consent of the governing body endorsed on the contract. Assignment by any other means renders the contract null and void as to any further performance by the contractor or the assignee, without any act on the part of the city, town or joint powers board. The city, town or joint powers board may at once proceed to relet the contract or may at its discretion proceed to complete the contract as agent at the expense of the contractor and his sureties.</p>
                  <p>(h) The city, town or joint powers board shall issue payments to contractors in accordance with W.S. 16-6-116(a).</p>
                  <p>(j) Any officer or employee of the city, town or joint powers board who aids any bidder or respondent in securing a contract to furnish labor, material or supplies at a higher or lower price than that proposed by any other bidder or respondent, or who favors one bidder or respondent over another by giving or withholding information, or who willfully misleads any bidder or respondent in regard to the character of the material or supplies called for, or who knowingly certifies to a greater amount or different kind of material or supplies than has been actually received, is guilty of malfeasance, which renders his office vacant.</p>
                  <p>(k) If an officer or employee is charged under subsection</p>
                  <p>(j) of this section:</p>
                  <p>(i) The officer or employee:</p>
                  <p>(A) Is entitled to a hearing before the governing body;</p>
                  <p>(B) Shall be served a copy of the charge at least ten (10) working days before the hearing;</p>
                  <p>(C) May present a defense in person or by counsel; and</p>
                  <p>(D) May have the finding of the governing body appealed to the district court.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The governing body of the city, town or joint powers board shall hold a hearing on its own motion or when the charge is signed by at least ten (10) qualified electors of the city or town, or in the case of a joint powers board ten (10) qualified electors of any member city or town and:</p>
                  <p>(A) May compel attendance and testimony of witnesses and production of papers;</p>
                  <p>(B) Shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law; and</p>
                  <p>(C) Shall render a conclusive decision upon a majority vote of the governing body.</p>
                  <p>(m) Any officer or employee of the city, town or joint powers board found guilty of malfeasance with regard to a contract shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).</p>
                  <p>(n) If any person to whom a contract has been awarded has colluded with any person to prevent any other competing bids being made, or has entered into an agreement by which he has made a higher or lower bid than some other person for the purpose of dividing the contract or profits therefrom between two (2) or more bidders, the contract is null and void, and the mayor or manager or joint powers board shall advertise for new bids or upon approval of the governing body provide for the work to be done under the mayor's, manager's or board's own supervision and control.</p>
                  <p>(o) Any contract made in violation of the provisions of this section is void, and any money paid on account of the contract by the city, town or joint powers board may be recovered without restitution of the property or benefits received or retained.</p>
                  <p>(p) Every contract of the kind specified in this section shall contain a provision expressly referring to this section and making it a part of the contract.</p>
                  <p>(q) A public improvement shall not be divided into smaller units for the sole purpose of avoiding the advertising requirement of this section.</p>
                  <p>(r) For purposes of this section "related costs" includes, but are not limited to, labor, labor burden, materials, transportation, storage, equipment, associated overhead and associated depreciation.</p>
                  <p>(s) As used in this section, a contract for public improvement shall not include an arrangement in which a municipality can accomplish an energy or water efficiency project without upfront capital costs or capital appropriations by compensating an energy or water efficiency contractor over time from guaranteed savings in energy or water costs that result from the project.</p>

                  <p>(e) Before any territory is eligible for annexation the governing body shall prepare for each landowner and affected public utility so requesting in writing, the estimated cost of infrastructure improvements required of the landowner and affected public utility related to the annexation.

                  <p>(ii) The ordinance is adopted within one hundred twenty (120) days after the receipt of the de-annexation petition and within one hundred eighty (180) days after the landowner's signature of the petition, unless a further consent of all the landowners is obtained before the effective date of the ordinance; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the de-annexation causes land within the city or town boundaries to no longer be contiguous with the rest of the city or town, the de-annexation ordinance may be adopted only with the consent of all the owners of the land to be isolated by the de-annexation.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the city or town owns any rights-of-way, easements, streets or other property or improvements within the area to be de-annexed it may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Vacate or abandon them;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Transfer them to the county government with the consent of the county commissioners;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Agree to transfer them to another city or town upon completion of the annexation of all or part of the de-annexed land to that other city or town;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Retain ownership of them.</p>
                  <p>(e) No de-annexation shall create an area which is situated entirely within the municipality but is not a part of the municipality.</p>
                  <p>(f) The landowner petitioning to have land de-annexed and his successors and assigns shall remain liable for any assessments incurred or levied while the land was within the city or town boundaries and for all mill levies necessary to repay any indebtedness that was outstanding at any time the property was within the city or town boundaries. Neither the de-annexation nor subsequent annexation to or incorporation as another city shall increase or decrease these liabilities.</p>

If disapproved, the commission shall communicate its reasons to the governing body which by a vote of not less than a majority of its membership may overrule the disapproval. If overruled, the governing body or the appropriate board or officer may proceed. However, if the public way, ground, place, space, building, structure or utility is one which the governing body, or other body or official of the municipality may not authorize or finance, then the submission to the commission shall be by the board or official having that jurisdiction, and the commission's disapproval may be overruled by that board by a majority vote or by that official.

                  <p>(a) After the commission has adopted a major street plan, the governing body may establish an official map of the whole or any part of the existing public streets. The map may also show the location of the lines of streets on plats of subdivisions which the commission has approved. The governing body may make other additions to or modifications of the official map by extending the lines of proposed new streets or street extensions, widenings, narrowings or vacations which have been accurately surveyed and definitely located. Before taking any such action the governing body shall hold a public hearing thereon. Any proposed addition to or modification of the official map shall be submitted to the commission for its approval. If the commission disapproves, approval of the addition or modification then requires an affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the governing body.</p>
                  <p>(b) The placing of any street or street lines upon the official map does not of itself constitute the opening or establishment of any street or the taking or acceptance of any land for street purposes.</p>

                  <p>(a) To preserve the integrity of the official map, the governing body may provide by ordinance, subject to appropriate eminent domain proceeding, that no permit may be issued for any building or structure which encroaches upon land located within the lines of any street as shown on the official map. The ordinance shall provide that the board of adjustment, which the governing body may create by ordinance, has the power, upon an appeal filed with it by the owner of any such land, to authorize a permit for a building or structure within any mapped-street location when it finds that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The property of the appellant a portion of which lies within the street lines will not yield a reasonable return to the owner unless the permit is granted; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Balancing the interest of the municipality in preserving the integrity of the official map and the interest of the owner in the use and benefits of the property, the grant of the permit is required by justice and equity.</p>
                  <p>(b) Before taking any action, the board shall hold a public hearing thereon.

                  <p>(iv) Reverse or affirm wholly or partly the order, requirement, decision or determination as necessary, but no power exercised under this paragraph shall exceed the power or authority vested in the administrative officer from whom the appeal is taken.</p>
                  <p>(c) The concurring vote of a majority of the board is necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any administrative official, or to decide in favor of the application on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any ordinance or to effect any variation in the ordinance.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any municipality or county may refund at any time any bonds issued under this article and outstanding, including without limitation short-term bonds issued in anticipation of the issuance of long-term bonds, by issuing refunding bonds in an amount sufficient to refund the principal together with any unpaid interest and any necessary premiums and commissions. An issue of refunding bonds may be combined with an issue of additional revenue bonds on any project if consistent with the requirements of W.S. 15-1-705. Any refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded have matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds in payment of the bonds to be refunded, or by exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded. The holders of any bonds to be refunded are not compelled without their consent to surrender their bonds for payment or exchange prior to the date on which they are by their terms subject to redemption by option or otherwise. Any refunding bonds are subject to the provisions of W.S. 15-1-703 and may be secured as provided in W.S. 15-1-704. The principal proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) To the immediate payment and retirement of the bonds being refunded; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) To the extent not required for the immediate payment of the bonds being refunded then the proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the bonds being refunded and to pay any expenses incurred in connection with refunding but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any surplus, including, without limitation, provision for the pledging of any surplus to the payment of the principal of and interest on any issue or series of refunding bonds. Money in any trust fund may be invested in direct obligations of or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government or obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of bonds being refunded but which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable or if presently redeemable, shall not have been called for redemption.</p>

The projects are not subject to taxation if they are not leased to or held by private interests on both the assessment date and the date the levy is made in any year. If personal property owned by a municipality or county is taxed under this section and the taxes are delinquent, levy by distress warrant for collection of the delinquent taxes may be made only on the personal property against which the taxes were levied.</p>
                  <p>(b) Projects initiated after February 16, 1967, are exempt from ad valorem taxes, but the governing body shall negotiate with the proposed lessee an annual fee in lieu of taxes, which shall fully compensate the state, the political subdivisions and other recipients of ad valorem taxes for the share each would have received had this exemption not been authorized. The annual fee, if payable to a municipality, shall be remitted by the municipality to the county treasurer of the county wherein the project is located before January 1 of the year following the year for which the fee is collected. The county treasurer shall distribute the fee together with similar fees collected from county projects to the state, the political subdivisions and other recipients of ad valorem taxes in the same manner and proportions as the ad valorem tax revenues received by the county are distributed as by law provided.</p>

                  <p>(a) Pursuant to this section and as an alternative to the procedures set forth in W.S. 15-1-701 through 15-1-708, a municipality or county may issue revenue bonds to defray the cost of acquiring, constructing or improving any project regardless of whether or not the municipality or county acquires any ownership interest in the project. The municipality or county may authorize the user of the project, or an agent of the user or a trustee, to disburse the proceeds of the revenue bonds to pay only those costs of the project specified in W.S. 15-1-707 and only upon the conditions that the user agrees to complete the acquisition or construction of the project and pay to the municipality or county an amount sufficient to pay, when due, the principal, interest and premium, if any, on the revenue bonds, and any other expenses incurred by the municipality or county in connection therewith. The revenue bonds are payable solely from the revenues derived from payments to the municipality or county by the user of the project. These revenues may be pledged and assigned to a trustee for the benefit of the bondholders. The revenues are not deemed to be revenues of any project.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the project is financed pursuant to this section, the provisions of W.S. 15-1-701 through 15-1-708 apply. However, the procedures shall contemplate and authorize a transaction in the form provided in this section rather than a transaction in the form of a lease or sale of a project, except that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section are not subject to the provisions of W.S. 15-1-704(a), but shall be secured by a pledge of the agreement of the user enterprise to pay principal, interest and premium, if any, on the bonds and any and all other expenses in connection with the bonds, and may be secured by any other agreement or obligation of the user enterprise or any other person;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The governing body of the municipality or county shall make similar determinations and findings as and where required by W.S. 15-1-705 before issuing bonds under this section;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Title to or in the project may at all times remain in the user or in any other person; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) The agreement or contract of the user with the municipality or county may include provisions the municipality or county deems appropriate to effect the financing of the proposed undertaking.</p>

                  <p>(ii) Pledge on-street parking meter funds, or proceeds of gasoline taxes in the manner and subject to the limitations prescribed by W.S. 15-6-437, as additional security for the bonds authorized in paragraph (iii) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Issue revenue bonds for the creation, purchase, lease, construction and maintenance of off-street parking facilities, or refunding revenue bonds to refund, pay or discharge all or a part of its off-street parking facility revenue bonds, including interest. The procedure for issuing revenue or refunding revenue bonds is the same as that prescribed by W.S. 35-2-424 through 35-2-436, as from time to time amended;</p>
                  <p>(iv) If parking meters are not used, use any other funds available to carry out the provisions of this article.</p>

The mayor may veto any item of any appropriation ordinance and approve the remainder thereof. The items vetoed may be passed over the veto as in other cases. The mayor does not have a vote in any matter involving the override of a veto.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any elected officer may be removed at any time by the qualified electors in the following manner: a petition signed by at least twenty-five percent (25%) of all the registered electors and demanding an election of a successor of the person sought to be removed shall be filed with the city clerk. The petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds for removal. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one (1) paper, but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence, giving the street and number. One (1) of the signers of each paper shall make oath before a competent officer that the statements therein made are true as he believes, and that each signature is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten (10) days from the date of filing the petition the clerk shall determine whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified electors. If necessary, the commission shall allow him extra help for that purpose. The clerk shall attach to the petition his certificate, showing the result of his examination. If the petition is insufficient, it shall be returned to the person who filed it, without prejudice to the filing of a new petition to the same effect. If the petition is sufficient, the clerk shall submit it to the governing body without delay. The governing body shall then fix a date for holding the election, not less than thirty (30) days nor more than forty (40) days from the date of the clerk's certificate of sufficiency. The commission shall publish notice and arrange for holding the election, which shall be conducted in the same manner as other city elections.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any person sought to be removed may be a candidate to succeed himself, and unless he requests otherwise in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the special primary election, the clerk shall place his name on the official ballot without nomination. On the second Tuesday preceding the date fixed for the special election, a special primary election for the selection of candidates shall be held. The special primary election and nomination are governed by the provisions of this article. If the person sought to be removed is a candidate, one (1) opposing candidate shall be selected at the special primary election. The special primary election shall be held if there are more than two (2) nominees, one (1) of whom may be incumbent. If there are no candidates nominated against the officer sought to be removed, no special election will be held and the incumbent shall continue in office.</p>
                  <p>(c) In any removal election the candidate receiving the highest number of votes is elected. The incumbent shall be removed from office upon the qualification of his successor, who shall hold office during the unexpired portion of the term for which his predecessor was elected. If the person who receives the highest number of votes fails to qualify within ten (10) days after receiving notification of election the office is vacant. This method of removal is in addition to any other methods provided by law.</p>

                  <p>(a) All owners of land adjoining any street, lane or alley shall construct or reconstruct a sidewalk and curb along the street, lane or alley next to the land when ordered to do so by the manager. All sidewalks and curbs shall be constructed as designated by the manager. However, the manager shall not require any person to construct a walk or curb in a different manner, or of a different material, than is required of other persons in the same block fronting the street. It is the duty of landowners to keep any sidewalk or curb now constructed, or which may hereafter be constructed in front of the land, in good repair and in safe condition.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the manager considers it necessary that a sidewalk or curb be constructed, reconstructed or repaired, notice shall be served upon the owner of the land along which it is to be constructed or repaired specifying the manner in which it is to be constructed or repaired and the estimated cost which may be assessed if the city or town does the work. The notice shall be served personally upon the owner, or if he is not to be found within the city or town, it shall be sent to him by registered or certified mail, requesting a return receipt, if his address is known. Otherwise it shall be published once in the official newspaper of the city or town. Unless the owner within two (2) weeks after service, mailing or publication of the notice, begins the construction or repair and completes it without delay, the manager shall have the work done at the expense of the permanent improvement revolving fund. Upon completion of the work, the manager shall certify the cost thereof to the clerk of the city or town. The governing body shall then fix a date for hearing upon the costs. The procedure for notice and hearing shall be as set forth in W.S. 15-6-405. Upon confirmation of the assessment by the governing body, the charge levied is a lien upon the property as set forth in W.S. 15-6-406. The governing body may levy and collect the assessment and provide for the manner of sale, redemption and conveyance of lands sold for nonpayment of the assessment in the manner provided in W.S. 15-6-401 through 15-6-448. When collected the assessment shall be paid into the revolving fund. The manager, upon proper showing made to him, may extend the time within which the construction or repair shall begin or be completed.</p>
                  <p>(c) Before ordering the construction of any new sidewalk or curb, the manager shall establish its grade and the width of the parking.</p>

                  <p>(a) All persons occupying positions affected by this article may retain their positions until discharged or reduced in grade under its provisions.</p>
                  <p>(b) Discharge from a department, or reduction in grade or compensation, or both, may be made for any cause, not political or religious, which will promote the efficiency of the service, on written notice and specifications filed with the commission and served upon the person affected by the authority requesting the discharge or reduction. The person whose discharge or reduction is sought is allowed a reasonable time to answer the charges in writing and demand a hearing. The commission, after hearing or investigation, shall determine whether the reason for discharge or reduction is sufficient and established. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section no person may be discharged or reduced in pay or rank without consent of the commission after a hearing, unless the action is pursuant to a classification program under W.S. 15-5-106. A copy of the specifications, notice, answer, consent and order of discharge or reduction are a part of the public records of the commission.</p>
                  <p>(c) In the case of a police department:</p>
                  <p>(i) A chief of police or his representative, after written notice, may suspend any regular employee without pay for disciplinary purposes. The chief or his representative shall file with the commission, on or before the effective date of the suspension, a written statement of the causes for such action;</p>
                  <p>(ii) A chief of police or his acting chief may discharge or reduce in grade any employee if he considers that the good of the service will be served thereby. Any employee who is discharged or reduced in grade has the right to answer in writing the statement of the chief as to the cause for his discharge or reduction in grade, as the case may be, and to file this and any other affidavits and exhibits in support of his statement with the commission.</p>
                  <p>(d) If any person in the fire department becomes sixty (60) years of age, the commission shall order that person retired from further service. However, if the person can pass annual mental and physical qualifications tests set by a physician chosen by the commission and governing body and given at no cost to the employee, he may be retained until he becomes sixty-five (65) years of age.</p>

                  <p>(a) In addition to the amount appropriated to the firemen's pension account by W.S. 15-5-202, every paid fireman may, at the discretion of the board, be assessed not more than eight percent (8%) of his gross monthly salary for the use and benefit of the account, up to the maximum monthly salary of a fireman first class.

                  <p>(d) Upon a determination by the board in accordance with subsection (g) of this section, every employer shall pay into the account for each paid fireman it employs an amount not to exceed twenty-one percent (21%) of the salary of a fireman first class. Any contributions imposed under this subsection, together with the paid firemen's contributions, shall be transferred and credited to the account in a manner as the board directs. If the contributions are not transferred to the board when due, they may be recovered, together with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum in an action brought for that purpose in the district court for the county in which the employer has its principal office.</p>
                  <p>(e) The contributions required by subsection (a) of this section shall be paid by the employer for paid firemen covered under this article in order to be treated as employer contributions for the sole purpose of determining tax treatment under the United States internal revenue code.</p>
                  <p>(f) The contributions under subsection (e) of this section shall be paid from the source of funds which is used in paying salary to paid firemen covered under this article. The employer may pay these contributions by a reduction in cash salary of the paid firemen or by an offset against a future salary increase, or by a combination of a reduction in salary and an offset against a future salary increase, provided:</p>
                  <p>(i) No such salary reduction or offset, or combination thereof, shall exceed the percentage amount actually being deducted from an employee's salary for contributions to the firemen's pension account as of July 1, 1983; and</p>

                  <p>(d) of this section. If contributions are reinstated at any time following suspension of contributions, the board shall provide notice of reinstated contributions to firemen and employers not less than six (6) months prior to the date of imposition.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>15-5-204. Pensions; amounts; qualifications; when paid; disability benefits; disqualifications; examinations; disallowance; actions; adjustment.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) Any person qualifying may retire from active service and receive a monthly pension of seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum monthly salary of a fireman first class. Any benefit increases which may occur shall not subsequently be withdrawn. This benefit accrues to any paid fireman who has completed twenty (20) years of active service in regularly constituted fire departments of any cities, towns, counties or fire protection districts and to any paid fireman suffering from a mental or physical disability rendering him unfit for active duty. Any paid fireman covered under this article may continue service beyond twenty (20) years and receive an additional benefit of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the maximum salary of a fireman first class for each year of service beyond twenty (20) years.</p>
                  <p>(b) Any fireman with less than ten (10) years of service upon terminating his employment for any reason shall receive in a lump sum a refund of all the money he has contributed to the firemen's pension account. Refund of such contributions extinguishes all rights to any benefits under this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) After ten (10) years as a full time paid fireman, any fireman upon terminating his employment for any reason may have his choice of:</p>
                  <p>(i) A refund, in a lump sum, of all the money he has contributed into the firemen's pension account, less one-half percent (1/2%) for bookkeeping costs; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Upon the twentieth anniversary of the date of his employment as a full time paid fireman he may draw a monthly pension computed as follows:</p>
                  <p>Number of years service x 75% of the maximum monthly salary of a fireman first class 20</p>
                  <p>(d) No fireman is entitled to draw a disability pension if the primary cause of the mental or physical disability which renders him unfit for active duty is alcoholism, substance abuse or addiction or an injury incurred as a result of the commission of a crime of a voluntary nature, or a mental or physical condition which existed at the time of his employment.</p>
                  <p>(e) The board may require firemen applying for or drawing a disability pension to submit periodically to a physical or mental examination by a physician it selects and to furnish relevant information it requests. If the physician's report, or other evidence available to the board, shows that the fireman is not qualified for the disability pension, or that he is fit for active duty, the board shall disallow or discontinue the payment of the monthly disability pension. Examining physicians selected by the board shall be paid from the account in accordance with existing worker's compensation schedules for examinations.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any applicant or beneficiary of the firemen's pension account aggrieved by a disallowance or discontinuance of pension benefits has a right to commence an action in the district court of the county in which the applicant resides, naming the board, as custodian of the firemen's pension account, as the party defendant, to have his rights to pension benefits determined before a judge of the district court.</p>
                  <p>(g) Any pension benefit, survivor benefit or disability benefit received by an eligible individual under this article, and the fireman for whom the benefit is generated has been retired for a period of not less than one (1) year, shall be increased each year by at least three percent (3%). In the event the most current actuarial valuation indicates the market value of assets is greater than one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the actuarial value of liabilities, the board may increase the benefit by an amount determined affordable by the actuary, but in no case shall the total increase be greater than five percent (5%) of the benefit. Any increase under this subsection shall be added to the pension benefit, survivor benefit or disability benefit and compounded for purposes of determining the total benefit amount in subsequent years.</p>
                  <p>(h) The board shall adopt rules to allow service for any period of time, after commencement of participation under this article, which an employee spends in active military or other emergency service of the United States as required by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any improvement may be initiated directly by the governing body by resolution declaring its intention to make improvements. The resolution shall specify with convenient certainty the streets or part thereof proposed to be improved, if the improvements are street improvements, the boundaries of the proposed assessment district, the character, kind and extent of the improvements and if paving is involved, the kinds of paving to be used. The resolution shall specify an estimate of the cost of the total improvement project and of each proposed assessment unit, if any, and also an estimate of the contract price of the total improvement project. The governing body shall not accept any bids or combination of bids which exceed by more than ten percent (10%) the estimates of the contract price, unless the legal owners of record of all property in the district waive this limitation.</p>
                  <p>(b) If an improvement will result in a change in existing street elevations or grades, it is sufficient if the resolution of intention so states without a description, directly or by reference, of the extent or location of the change.</p>
                  <p>(c) If any part of an improvement is to be paid out of the general fund or road fund of the city or town, or out of funds available to the city or town from any other source, the resolution shall so state. If the improvement is to be maintained by the contractor for a specified period, not to exceed five (5) years, the resolution shall contain a statement to that effect and that the charge for maintenance is to be included in the assessment for the improvement.</p>
                  <p>(d) The resolution shall fix the time and place, when and where the governing body will meet to consider any remonstrances and objections to the proposed improvements, and the time within which remonstrances and objections must be filed with the city or town recorder. It shall direct the recorder to give a fifteen (15) day notice to all legal owners of record of the property liable to assessment for the proposed improvements by publishing the resolution in one (1) issue of some newspaper published in the city or town once a week or more often. If no newspaper is published within the city or town, notice may be published in any newspaper of general circulation in the county once a week or more often. In addition to the publication, a copy of the resolution of intention shall be mailed, postage prepaid, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, to each legal owner of record of the property within the proposed district.</p>
                  <p>(e) The resolution when published and mailed as a notice shall have the following caption:</p>
                  <p>"Notice to all persons liable to assessment for the improvement of (state names of streets or if improvement is not to be located in the streets, identify by general character and general location). The governing body of the city (city or town) on the .... day of .... passed the following resolution of intention."</p>

                  <p>At any time within fifteen (15) days from the publication of the resolution of intention, the owners of property situated within the proposed assessment district may file with the city clerk their written objections to the proposed improvement. If protests against the making of the improvements are filed by the legal owners of record of more than one-half (1/2) of the area of the property subject to assessment therefor, within an assessment district, the proposed improvements within that district shall be abandoned. No protest will be considered unless filed within fifteen (15) days after the publication of resolution of intention. If any petition is filed signed by the owners of fifty percent (50%) of the property proposed in the petition to be assessed for any local improvement, the governing body shall proceed with the type of improvement set forth in the petition, following the same procedure as though initiated by resolution.</p>

                  <p>(a) Immediately upon the passage of the ordinance, the city engineer shall prepare and file with the city clerk, plans and specifications which shall show in detail the work to be done, the quantities of material to be handled and the estimated cost of the improvements.

                  <p>(b) The improvements may be made under contracts, or as a part of a contract, publicly let by the state or any agency thereof, or by the city or town in the manner provided in this section and W.S. 15-6-302, or the city or town may make the improvements with its own equipment, labor and materials, without contract, or any combination of methods may be followed. If the improvements are to be made by municipal contracts, the city clerk shall call for bids by publishing a notice in at least one (1) issue of some newspaper published within the city or town or within the county in which the city or town is located and in such other papers as the governing body may provide in the ordinance.</p>
                  <p>(c) The improvements may be made with the cooperation and assistance of the United States government or any agency or subdivision thereof, and the city or town may take advantage of any offer from any source to complete the improvements on a division of expense or responsibility.</p>

                  <p>(iv) That a certified or cashier's check or bid bond in the sum of five percent (5%) of the amount of the bid must be filed with the bid, to be forfeited to the city or town as liquidated damages if the bidder is awarded the contract and fails to enter into a contract with the city or town within five (5) days from the date of his notification;</p>
                  <p>(v) The successful bidder shall perform the work and furnish a bond guaranteeing the faithful performance of the work and a maintenance bond, if required by the governing body, which shall be furnished at the time of signing the contract.

                  <p><shortTitle>15-6-404. Assessments; property included in district; methods of computation; combining improvements; ordinances and resolutions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The assessment district shall include all the property benefited by the improvement or improvements as determined by the governing body, including municipal and other public property, except that of the United States government or any agency, instrumentality or corporation thereof in the absence of the consent of congress. If the improvement district includes unplatted or undivided land, the distance back from the improvement for computing assessments and fixing the assessment lien shall be the same as the distance back in the immediately adjoining platted area.</p>
                  <p>(b) Assessments shall be computed by one (1) or more of the following methods:</p>
                  <p>(i) Each one-half (1/2) block or fraction thereof within the district contiguous to each street, alley, avenue, boulevard or parkway in or along which the improvement or improvements are to be made shall be divided, irrespective of number and location of lots, into three (3) equal subdivisions parallel to the street, alley, avenue, boulevard or parkway to be improved. The subdivisions shall be numbered one (1), two (2) and three (3) respectively, beginning next to the street, alley, avenue, boulevard or parkway. The total assessment for each one-half (1/2) block or fraction thereof abutting on either side of each street, alley, avenue, boulevard or parkway to be improved, as fixed by the governing body, shall be apportioned as follows:</p>
                  <p>(A) Subdivision number one (1), sixty percent (60%);</p>
                  <p>(B) Subdivision number two (2), thirty percent (30%);</p>
                  <p>(C) Subdivision number three (3), ten percent (10%).</p>
                  <p>(ii) Each one-half (1/2) block contiguous to each street, alley, avenue, boulevard or parkway in or along which the improvement or improvements are to be made shall be assessed on an area basis, so that the assessment against each piece of property assessed shall be in the proportion that the square footage of that piece of property bears to the total square footage of the assessable property within the one-half (1/2) block;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Each piece of property abutting on the street, alley, avenue, boulevard or parkway in or along which the improvement or improvements are to be made shall be assessed on a lineal foot basis so that the total assessment against each piece of a property shall be in the proportion that the abutting lineal footage of that piece of property bears to the total abutting lineal footage of the property to be assessed for the same improvement or improvements;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Each piece of property which the governing body reasonably determines to be benefited by the proposed improvement, regardless of whether the improvement is located in and along a street, alley, avenue, boulevard or parkway, and regardless of whether the property lies within the one-half (1/2) block abutting the improvement, shall be assessed on an area basis, or lineal foot basis, or any other uniform basis so that property similarly benefited will be similarly assessed. Regardless of the method or methods of computation selected by the governing body, and notwithstanding the provisions made for computation to the center of the block or within the one-half (1/2) block, the assessment may be levied and the assessment lien thereby made to attach, upon all of a piece of benefited property so as to avoid the imposition of a lien upon a part of a subdivided lot or parcel under common ownership and use. In the case of any irregular-shaped or nonuniform block or lot, tract, parcel of land or other unit of property to be assessed, an appropriate adjustment may be made, so that the assessment there against is in proportion to the benefits derived.</p>
                  <p>(c) More than one (1) improvement may be combined in a single local improvement district when the governing body determines that the combination is both efficient and economical. If the combination of improvements are separate and distinct by reason of substantial difference in their character or location, or otherwise, the estimated costs of each improvement shall be segregated for the levy of assessments and an equitable share of the incidental costs allocated to each improvement. In the absence of arbitrary or unreasonable abuse of discretion, its determination of the portion of the project constituting a separate improvement for purposes of segregation is conclusive.</p>
                  <p>(d) Each city and town may adopt all ordinances and resolutions necessary to levy and collect the special assessment and providing for the manner of sale, redemption and conveyance of lands sold for nonpayment of special assessments.</p>

                  <p>(a) When an assessment roll for local improvements has been prepared, it shall be filed with the clerk of the city or town. The governing body shall then fix a date for hearing upon the roll before it and direct the clerk to give notice of the time and place of the hearing. Any person may object to the roll in writing and file the objections with the clerk on or before the date of the hearing. At the time and place fixed and at such other times to which the hearing may be continued, the governing body shall sit as a board of equalization to consider the roll. At the hearing or hearings, the governing body will consider the objections or any part thereof, and correct, revise, raise, lower, change or modify the roll or any part thereof, or set it aside and order that the roll assessments be made de novo, in a manner appearing just and equitable, and then proceed to confirm the roll by ordinance. The notice of the hearing shall be published at least twice, by two (2) weekly publications in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town. However, at least fifteen (15) days must elapse between the date of the first publication and the date fixed for the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(b) The notice shall also be given by the clerk, or his deputy by deposit of the notice, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date fixed for hearing, in the United States mails, postage prepaid, as first class mail, addressed to the last known owner or owners of each tract being assessed at their last known addresses. In the absence of fraud the failure to mail any notice does not invalidate any assessment or any proceedings under this chapter. Any list of names or addresses pertaining to any district may be revised from time to time, but it need not be revised more frequently than at twelve (12) month intervals. Any mailing of notice prescribed by this chapter shall be verified by the affidavit or certificate of the person mailing the notice, and the verification shall be retained in the records of the city or town at least until all assessments and bonds pertaining thereto have been paid in full.</p>
                  <p>(c) All objections to the roll shall state clearly the grounds of objections and unless made within the time and in the manner prescribed are conclusively presumed to have been waived. If any roll is amended so as to raise any assessments or to include omitted property, a new time and place for hearing and a new notice of hearing on the amended roll shall be fixed and given as in the case of an original hearing. However, if any property has been entered originally upon the roll and the assessment upon the property has not been raised, no objections thereto may be considered by the governing body or by any court on appeal, unless they were made in writing at or before the date fixed for the original hearing. When an assessment roll is confirmed, it shall be certified to by the city clerk and transmitted to the city treasurer for collection.</p>

                  <p>(a) The charge on the respective lots, tracts, parcels of land and other property for the purpose of special assessments, to pay the cost and expense in whole or in part of any improvement authorized in this chapter, when assessed and the assessment roll is confirmed by the governing body, shall be a lien upon the property assessed from the time the assessment roll is placed in the hands of the officer authorized by law to collect the assessment. The lien shall be paramount and superior to any other lien or encumbrance created before or after, except a lien for assessments for general taxes.</p>
                  <p>(b) In order to have a valid, enforceable lien under this section, a lien statement sworn to before a notarial officer, shall be filed by the claimant with the county clerk of the county in which the assessment district is located. The county clerk shall file the statement and index by date, name of claimant and property owner, and by legal description. The lien statement shall contain the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The name and address of the governing body seeking to enforce the lien;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The name and address of the person against whose property the lien is filed; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The legal description of the property to which the lien attaches.</p>
                  <p>(c) Special assessment rolls approved prior to July 1, 1989 and still in effect, shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the district is located.</p>

                  <p>(a) If an assessment or any installment thereof is delinquent, the city or town, by general ordinance, may provide for the sale of property described in the local assessment roll for:</p>
                  <p>(i) The amount of the delinquent assessment or installment, together with penalty and interest accruing to date of sale;</p>

If there is no bidder for any lot, tract or parcel of land, or other property, for a sum sufficient to pay the delinquent and unpaid assessment thereon, or installment thereof, together with interest, penalty and costs, the treasurer shall strike it off to the city or town for the whole amount which he is required to collect by the sale. If any bidder to whom any property is stricken off at the sale does not pay the assessment, interest, penalty and costs before 10:00 a.m. of the day following the sale, the property must then be resold, or if the assessment sale is closed, the property is deemed to have been sold to the city or town, and a certificate of sale shall be issued to the city or town therefor.</p>
                  <p>(d) Any city or town may enter into an agreement with any person to provide that the person, in case of a sale under this section of the lots, tracts or parcels specified in the agreement, shall bid an amount at least equal to the sum of the total unpaid assessment, including delinquencies, and penalty, interest and costs to date of sale for each of the lots, tracts or parcels specified in the agreement.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any city or town, at any time after the period of redemption has expired and deeds have been issued to the city or town by virtue of any proceedings under this chapter, may sell any such property at public auction to the highest bidder for cash. No bid may be accepted for any amount less than the amount set forth in the deed, plus accrued interest to date of sale, computed on the assessment for which the property was sold from the date of the execution of the deed, and all delinquent assessments and taxes against the property with accrued interest, penalties, costs and other charges.

                  <p>(a) Any property sold for an assessment is subject to redemption by the former owner, or his grantee, mortgagee, heir or other representative at any time within two (2) years from the date of the sale, upon the payment to the treasurer for the purchaser of the amount for which the property was sold, with interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year, together with all taxes and special assessments, interest, penalties, costs and other charges thereon paid by the purchaser at or since the sale, with like interest thereon. Unless written notice of taxes and assessments subsequently paid, and the amount thereof, is deposited with the city or town treasurer, property may be redeemed without their inclusion. On any redemption, the treasurer shall give to the redemptioner a certificate of redemption and pay over the amount received to the purchaser of the certificate of sale or his assigns. If property is not redeemed within the period of two (2) years, the treasurer, on demand of the purchaser or his assigns and the surrender to him of the certificate of sale, shall execute a deed for the property to the purchaser or his assigns. No deed may be executed until the holder of the certificate of sale has notified the owners of the property that he holds the certificate and that he will demand a deed therefor. The notice shall be given by personal service upon the owners. If the owners are nonresidents of the state or cannot be found within the state after diligent search, the notice may be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town once a week for three (3) successive weeks. The notice and return thereof, with the affidavit of the person, or in case of a city or town, of the comptroller or clerk, claiming a deed, showing that service was made, shall be filed with the treasurer. If property is not redeemed within sixty (60) days after the date of service, or the date of the first publication of the notice, the holder of the certificate of sale is entitled to a deed. The deed shall be executed only for the property described in the certificate, and after payment of all delinquent taxes and special assessments, or installments and certificates of delinquency or other certificates issued for special or local assessments, whether levied, assessed or issued before or after the issuance of the certificates of sale. Any deed may be issued to any city or town for the face amount of the certificate of sale, plus accrued interest, costs, penalties and charges, and be held by the city or town subject to the liens of general taxes and special assessments.</p>
                  <p>(b) The deed shall be:</p>
                  <p>(i) Executed in the name of the city or town by which the improvement was made and shall recite in substance:</p>
                  <p>(A) The matters contained in the certificate of sale;</p>
                  <p>(B) The notice to the owner; and</p>
                  <p>(C) That no redemption has been made of the property within the time allowed by law.</p>
                  <p>(c) The deed shall be signed and acknowledged by the city or town treasurer and is prima facie evidence that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The property was assessed according to law;</p>
                  <p>and</p>
                  <p>(ii) The property was not redeemed;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Due notice of demand for deed had been given;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The person executing the deed was the proper officer.</p>
                  <p>(d) The deed is conclusive evidence of the regularity of all other proceedings from the assessment, up to and including the execution of the deed, and shall convey the entire fee simple title to the property described, except as otherwise provided for cities and towns, stripped of all liens and claims except assessments for local improvements or installments thereof not delinquent.</p>

                  <p>Any city or town may proceed with the collection or enforcement of any delinquent assessment or delinquent installment in an action brought in its own name in the district court in the county in which the city or town is located. It is not necessary to bring a separate suit for each piece or parcel of property delinquent, but all or any part of the property delinquent under any single assessment roll or assessment district may be proceeded against in the same action. Any of the owners or persons interested in any of the property may be joined as parties defendant in the action to foreclose, and any liens for delinquent assessments or installments may be foreclosed in the proceeding. The proceeding shall be tried before the court without a jury. In any such proceeding, it is sufficient to allege the passage of the ordinance providing for the improvement, the making of the improvement, the levying of the improvement assessment, the confirmation thereof, the date of delinquency of the assessment or installment and that the assessment was not paid prior to the delinquency or at all. The assessment roll and confirmatory order or authenticated copies are prima facie evidence of the regularity and legality of the proceedings connected therewith, and the burden of proof is upon the defendants. In any action where the owners or parties interested in any particular lot, tract or parcel of land or other property included in the suit suffer a default, the court may enter judgment of foreclosure and sale as to those parties and property and order execution thereon, and the action may proceed as to the remaining defendants and property. The judgment of the court shall specify separately the amount of the assessment or installment, with interest, penalty and costs, chargeable to the several lots, tracts and parcels of land and other property in the proceedings. The judgment has the effect of a separate judgment, and any appeal shall not invalidate or delay it except as to the property which is the subject of the appeal. In entering judgment the court shall decree that such lots, tracts or parcels of land or other property be sold to enforce the judgment and execution shall issue for the enforcement of the decree. Judgment may be entered as to any one (1) or more lots, tracts or parcels of land or other property involved, and the court may retain jurisdiction of the case as to the balance. All proceedings supplemental to judgment, including appeal, order of sale, period of redemption, sale and the issuance of deed shall be conducted in accordance with the law relating to property sold upon foreclosure of real estate mortgages.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any city or town, by ordinance, may provide for the issuance of certificates of delinquency for any delinquent assessment or installment and any penalty and interest thereon to date of issuance. The certificates of delinquency constitute a lien against the property upon which assessments were levied. They shall bear interest from the date of issuance at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year and may be foreclosed after two (2) years from the date of their issuance in the same manner and with the same effect as mortgages upon real estate are foreclosed.</p>
                  <p>(b) The certificates may be:</p>
                  <p>(i) Issued to the city or town;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Sold to any person applying for them;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Assigned in writing, and the city or town may sell and assign any certificates issued to it upon the payment, in cash of the principal and accrued interest.</p>
                  <p>(c) A certificate is prima facie evidence that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The land against which it was issued was subject to the assessment at the time assessed;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The property was assessed as required by law;</p>
                  <p>and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The assessment or installment was not paid prior to the issuance of the certificate.</p>
                  <p>(d) No certificate of delinquency may be issued upon any property for any assessment or installment during the pendency of any proceedings in court affecting the assessment or installment thereof.</p>

                  <p>(b) In any such case, the governing body shall first pass a resolution:</p>
                  <p>(i) Setting forth that certain described property was omitted from the assessment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Notifying all persons who may desire to object to appear at a meeting of the governing body at a time specified in the resolution; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Directing the proper board, officer or authority to report at or prior to the hearing the amount which should be borne by each lot, tract or parcel of land or other property omitted.</p>
                  <p>(c) The resolution shall be mailed and published in the manner provided for the giving of notice in W.S. 15-6-202.</p>
                  <p>(d) After the hearing, the governing body shall consider the matter as though the property had been included upon the original roll and may confirm all or any portion thereof by ordinance. The roll of omitted property shall then be certified to the treasurer for collection in the same manner as other assessments.</p>

                  <p>(a) The holder of any certificate of sale or delinquency for general taxes, before commencing any action to foreclose the lien, shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Pay in full all local assessments or installments outstanding against the whole or any portion of the property included in the certificate; or</p>

                  <p>(a) If any special assessment for local improvements is invalid in whole or in part for any reason, the governing body may reassess the assessments and enforce their collection in accordance with the provisions of law and ordinance existing at the time the reassessment is made. If for any reason the amount assessed is insufficient to pay the cost and expense of the improvement made and enjoyed by the owners of property in the assessment district, the governing body shall reassess all property in the assessment district to pay for the improvement. The assessment shall be made according to the provisions of law and ordinance existing at the time of its levy. Any city or town may assess or reassess all property which the governing body finds to be specially benefited to pay the whole or any portion of the cost and expense of any local improvement whether or not the property so assessed or reassessed abuts upon, is adjacent to, or proximate to the improvement, or was included in the original assessment district. The right to assess all property found to be specially benefited also applies to any supplemental assessment or reassessment which the city or town finds necessary to provide for any deficiency in any local improvement district fund caused by the invalidity of any portion of the original assessment in the improvement district, or if for any cause the amount originally assessed is insufficient to pay the cost of the improvement.</p>
                  <p>(b) If any assessment or reassessment for any local improvement is declared void and its enforcement refused by any court, or for any cause is set aside, annulled or declared void by any court, either directly or by virtue of any decision of the court, the governing body shall assess or reassess the property which has been or will be benefited by the local improvement, based upon its actual cost at the time of its completion.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>15-6-428. Reassessments; ordinance; roll; effect of contracts or irregularities; limitation; payment.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The governing body of any city or town shall proceed with any assessment authorized by W.S. 15-6-427 by ordinance so ordering and directing the preparation of an assessment roll. The roll may include any property specially benefited by the improvement, whether or not it was included in the original assessment district. When assessed the additional property becomes a part of the local improvement district, and all payments of assessments shall be paid into the local improvement fund to pay for the improvement.</p>
                  <p>(b) The fact that the contract has been let or that the improvement has been made and computed in whole or in part does not prevent the making of the assessment. The omission, failure or neglect of an officer to comply with the provisions of law or ordinance of the city or town, as to any matter connected with the improvement and the first assessment thereof does not invalidate or in any other way affect the making of any assessment authorized by W.S. 15-6-427. However, the assessment shall not exceed the actual cost and expense of the improvement, together with the accrued interest thereon, and the cost of the reassessment. It is the intent of this chapter to make the cost and expense of local improvements payable by the property specially benefited thereby, notwithstanding that the proceedings of the governing body, board of public works or other board, officers or authority of the city or town may be found irregular or defective, whether jurisdictional or otherwise. When the assessment is completed, all sums paid on the former attempted assessment shall be credited to the property for which they were paid.</p>
                  <p>(c) If any property within the original local improvement district is not affected by any assessment authorized by W.S. 15-6-427, it need not be entered upon the assessment roll.</p>
                  <p>(d) After certification of the roll to the treasurer of the city or town for collection, the same time for payment of assessments, without the imposition of any penalties or interest, and the notice that the assessments are in the hands of the treasurer for collection, shall be given as in the case of an original assessment. After delinquency the penalty and interest shall be charged as on original assessment. If the original assessment was payable in installments, the new assessment, after delinquency, may be divided into equal installments and made payable as the governing body may prescribe in the ordinance ordering the new assessment.</p>

                  <p>(ii) In the case of supplemental assessments within three (3) years from the time it was determined that the total amount of the valid assessments levied and assessed on account of any improvement was insufficient to pay the whole or that portion of the cost and expense to be paid by special assessment.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the amount collected by assessment is insufficient to pay the cost of the improvement, the governing body may authorize the payment of the deficit out of the permanent improvement fund.</p>

                  <p>(vii) May be payable in any place within or without the state including the office of the state treasurer.</p>
                  <p>(c) Each bond shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Have interest coupons attached for each payment;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Have the seal of the city or town affixed to it and refer to the improvement for which issued and the ordinance ordering its issuance;</p>

Unless the legal owners of record of all property assessed in the district waive the thirty (30) day cash payment period, the city or town treasurer, as soon as the assessment roll has been placed in his hands for collection, shall publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town.

                  <p>(a) If the governing body has made any contract for any local improvement or makes any assessment against property within any local improvement district and has in making the contract or assessment acted in good faith and without fraud, the contract and assessment is valid and enforceable, and the assessment is a lien upon the property involved.</p>
                  <p>(b) No objection to the validity of the contract or assessment may be made on the ground that:</p>
                  <p>(i) The contract for the improvement was not awarded in the manner or at the time required by law;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The assessment was made by an unauthorized officer or person, if it has been confirmed by the governing body;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The contract or assessment is based upon a front foot basis or upon a basis of benefits to the property within the district, unless it appears that the city or town authorities acted fraudulently or oppressively in making the assessment.</p>
                  <p>(c) All assessments made by the city or town authorities in good faith are valid, in full force and effect and collectible in the manner provided by law for the collection of assessments.</p>

                  <p>(a) All railway and street railway companies shall make or reconstruct all or those portions of all paving, graveling or macadamizing between the rails of their tracks and one (1) foot outside thereof at their own expense as the city or town may require. The improvement or the reconstruction shall be of the material and character ordered by the city or town and shall be done at the same time that the rest of the improvement is made or reconstructed. No work on the improvement along the railway or street railway may be permitted to delay or interfere with the work of the general improvement of the street, and no use may be made of that portion of the railway or street railway, without the written permission of the city engineer, during the progress of the work or until the improvement is safe for use and open for traffic by the city engineer.</p>
                  <p>(b) When the improvement is being constructed or reconstructed the companies shall lay, in the best approved manner, such rails as the governing body may require. The companies shall keep and maintain the paving, graveling and macadamizing between their rails and one (1) foot outside thereof and the rails up to the surface grade of the improved street, according to the plans and survey of the city therefor and all in good repair, using the same material as is used for the original improvement or such other material as the governing body may order. When the improvement of any street is being constructed or reconstructed the companies shall raise or lower their tracks and rails to conform to the grade established by the city or town for the improvement. If any railway or street railway company fails or refuses to comply with an order, resolution or ordinance of the governing body to make, reconstruct, maintain or repair an improvement, the work may be done by the city and the cost and expense thereof shall be assessed against the company and upon its real estate and personal property within the corporate limits of the city or town and the franchise granted to the company in the manner provided for the assessment of the cost against other property. The assessment may be collected in the manner provided for other assessments or in a direct proceeding in the district court. If the cost of any part of the improvement of any street is charged against any railway or street railway company or its property, plans and specifications for that part of the improvement shall be included in the plans and specifications filed by the city engineer for the improvement of the other portions of the street. The bids therefor shall be called for by the city or town in connection with the bids for the remainder of the improvement and received showing the cost per square yard separately from the cost per square yard of the other portions of the improvement. If done by the city or town, the cost shall be determined separately from the cost of the other portions of the improvement. At any time after the advertisement for bids for graveling, macadamizing or paving of any street or streets occupied by any railway or street railway, they shall file with the governing body a statement indicating whether they refuse to construct or reconstruct the improvement or whether they desire the city or town to do the improving and charge the cost against the company. The instrument shall be filed not more than three (3) days after the opening of the bids for the work, and if the instrument is not filed within that time, it is deemed a refusal to do the improving themselves and a request for the city or town to construct it and assess the cost to the company. Special improvement warrants or bonds may be issued for the construction or reconstruction or maintenance of an improvement, the cost of which is assessed to the company.</p>
                  <p>(c) If any tracks or rails of any railway or street railway are laid or relaid upon any street or streets improved by paving, graveling or macadamizing, the company shall do the work under the supervision of the city engineer and in such a manner as to injure the improvement as little as possible and shall reconstruct those portions removed or injured by them so that the street is left in as good a condition as it was prior to commencing the laying or relaying of tracks or rails.</p>
                  <p>(d) Railway or street railway companies as used in this section include the owner or owners of any railway or street railway whether persons or corporations.</p>

                  <p>Any first class city or any town having a population of four thousand (4,000) or more may provide by ordinance for letting to the lowest responsible bidder for any period not exceeding one (1) year, as prescribed by the ordinance, a contract for the construction, in accordance with specifications prepared by the city engineer and approved by the governing body, of all cement or concrete sidewalks which the governing body may order constructed during the term of the contract. The proposed ordinance shall be published at least two (2) times in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town, and written notice thereof shall be served in the manner provided by Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure upon the owner or owners of property abutting the sidewalks which have then been ordered and which are then proposed to be ordered to be constructed. The first publication of the ordinance shall be made and written notices served not less than thirty (30) days before the date for hearing objections. Any owner of any lot or parcel of land or property to be assessed for the cost of construction of the sidewalks then ordered or proposed to be ordered to be constructed may appear in person or by counsel at the hearing and show cause, if any, why the sidewalks should not be constructed. If objections are made to the construction of the sidewalks by the owners or agents representing more than one-half (1/2) of the total number of lineal feet frontage of all property which would be assessed to defray the cost of the sidewalks, the sidewalks shall not be constructed. The contractor shall give bond for the performance of his contract as required by the ordinance. The ordinance shall provide that upon ordering the construction of any such sidewalk the city engineer or the street commissioner shall immediately give written notice thereof, served personally on the owner or owners, or agents of the abutting property, or by publication once a week for a period of four (4) weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town, fully describing the termini, course, width and character of the walk ordered. The notice shall provide for a period of thirty (30) days during which parties so desiring may construct the walk abutting their property, and that all the walks so ordered remaining unbuilt at the expiration of the thirty (30) days from the date of service, or of the first publication, shall be constructed by the contractor. The ordinance shall also provide that at the expiration of the thirty (30) days the city engineer or the street commissioner shall notify the contractor to build the portions of the sidewalk ordered that have not been built. The contractor shall construct the sidewalk in accordance with the ordinance and his contract within sixty (60) days after he is so notified.</p>

                  <p>A tax to be fixed by ordinance shall be levied each year to pay the interest on the bonds and to create a sinking fund for their redemption.

If at the expiration of thirty (30) days the holder of those bonds fails to present them for payment, the interest thereon ceases, but the treasurer shall redeem them on presentation.

                  <p>(c) Repealed by Laws 1985, ch. 209, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the governing body determines to operate its waterworks and sewerage system as a single enterprise pursuant to paragraph (a)(v) of this section, it may issue revenue bonds in the manner provided in this article, payable solely from the revenue derived from the operation of the combined waterworks and sewerage system to pay for improvements, additions and extensions to the combined waterworks and sewer systems. If there are any outstanding bonds payable solely from the revenue of the waterworks or sewerage systems, or from the combined waterworks systems, the new bonds may include an amount sufficient to retire the outstanding bonds or may be made subordinate to the outstanding bonds with respect to the payment of principal, interest and security. Any law which requires that revenue derived from the operation of a waterworks system by a city or town applies only to the payment of the principal and interest of water bonds is inapplicable if the municipality operates its waterworks and sewerage system as a single enterprise, and in that case the revenues derived from operation of the water system may be used to retire either water bonds or sewerage system bonds.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any city or town may make special assessments for the construction of sewers and water mains. The assessments shall be made on all lots and pieces of ground to the center of the block, or if the sewers or water mains are constructed in an alley, then on all lots and pieces of ground to the nearest street or avenue on each side of the alley, extending along the street, avenue or alley, the distance of the improvement, according to the area of the lots or pieces of ground without regard to the buildings or improvements. The amount to be paid by each property holder shall be determined by dividing the expenses of the construction of the proposed sewer or water main among all the property holders for the benefit of whose property the sewer or water main is to be constructed. In the case of unplatted acreage within the city limits, the city or town shall consider that only the first seventy-five (75) feet in each direction from the sewer or water main is benefited and so assessed. However, if any property in an unplatted area is later connected to or receives service from the sewer or water main, that property shall be assessed its proportionate share. The amount to be assessed against each property holder shall be in proportion to the number of square feet each owns to the entire number of square feet assessed for the expense of the construction.</p>
                  <p>(b) The city or town may adopt ordinances providing for the manner of sale, redemption and conveyance of lands sold for nonpayment of the special assessments.</p>

                  <p>(a) All cities and towns owning their municipal water system or plant may enter into agreements with customers whose lands lie outside the corporate limits to supply water for their use and needs. The water system may be extended and maintained beyond the corporate limits only if it is economically feasible in the opinion of the governing body. The governing body may finance the extension and maintenance of the water system through revenue bonds or other means granted by law for financing of its water system and improvements. A one-time connection fee reasonably calculated to permit recovery of a proportionate share of the municipality's infrastructure cost necessary to treat and convey the water may be charged. A one- time fee may also be charged to recover reasonable expenses incurred by the public entity in determining the actual costs of treating and delivering water to the point of connection. Any charges for special services such as customer's line maintenance shall be in addition to the water rate. The rate established for use of water pursuant to this section is as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a city or town whose water supply system is funded in whole or in part by state grants or loans which at any time after April 1, 1999 or later, enters into a new contract or extends an existing contract to supply water to customers outside its corporate limits shall in establishing rates be limited to the actual costs of providing and delivering water as defined by paragraph (ii) of this subsection, except as otherwise provided by W.S. 15-7-407;</p>
                  <p>(ii) For customers outside their corporate limits beginning April 1, 1999, where the city or town is a recipient of state grants or loans, and except as otherwise provided in W.S. 15-7-407, the established water rate shall not exceed the actual costs of providing and delivering water to the point of connection to the city's or town's water system. Prior to December 1, 1998, or where the city or town is not a recipient of state grants or loans and except as otherwise provided in W.S. 15-7-407, the established rate shall be applied uniformly and shall not exceed two (2) times the established rate within the corporate limits. The governing body of the city or town may establish one (1) or more unincorporated service areas in each of which an average water rate may be used for all customers. As used in this paragraph, "actual costs of providing and delivering water" shall include a proportionate share of the following costs related to the water system:</p>
                  <p>(A) Fees, interest charges and principal payments on all bonds issued and other indebtedness incurred to construct, purchase or improve the utility;</p>
                  <p>(B) Salaries and wages of employees;</p>
                  <p>(C) The cost of materials, supplies, utilities and outside services;</p>
                  <p>(D) Other costs directly related to the delivery system;</p>
                  <p>(E) The cost for providing and maintaining a depreciation fund, a fund for emergencies and a fund for acquisition and development of new water rights and water sources;</p>
                  <p>(F) Administrative and overhead expenses; and</p>
                  <p>(G) The cost of acquiring, transporting, processing and treating water.</p>
                  <p>(b) If requested by the party seeking water service from the city or town and upon approval of the city or town, subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if the ratio of the rate charged to customers outside the corporate limits of the city or town to the established rate within the corporate limits are less than one and one-quarter (1.25) to one (1).</p>
                  <p>(c) The provisions of this section are not subject to certificates of public convenience and necessity of the public service commission.

                  <p>(a) It is hereby found and declared that there exists in municipalities of the state slum and blighted areas (as herein defined) which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of slums and blight is a matter of state policy and state concern.</p>
                  <p>(b) It is further found and declared that certain slum or blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this act, since the prevailing conditions of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this act, be susceptible to conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated, remedied or prevented; and that salvageable slum and blighted areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action as herein authorized, and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas.</p>
                  <p>(c) It is further found and declared that the powers conferred by this act are for public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and the power of eminent domain and police power exercised; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions herein enacted is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.</p>

                  <p>(a) Following the hearing specified in W.S. 15-9-109, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal project and the plan therefor if it finds that:</p>

                  <p>(D) The acquisition of the area for residential uses is an integral part of and essential to the program of the municipality;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If it is to be developed for nonresidential uses, the local governing body shall determine that the:</p>
                  <p>(A) Nonresidential uses are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper growth and development of the community in accordance with sound planning standards and local community objectives;</p>
                  <p>(B) Acquisition may require the exercise of governmental action as provided in this chapter, because of:</p>

                  <p>(b) The sale, lease, other transfer or retention of property specified in subsection (a) of this section, and any agreement relating thereto, may be made only after the local governing body approves the urban renewal plan.</p>

                  <p>(e) The municipality in any instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee may provide that the purchaser or lessee is without power to sell, lease or otherwise transfer the real property without the prior written consent of the municipality until he has completed the construction of any improvements which he is obligated to construct thereon. Real property acquired by a municipality which is to be transferred in accordance with the provisions of the urban renewal plan, shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with carrying out of the provisions of the plan. Any contract for the transfer and the urban renewal plan shall be recorded in the land records of the county in the manner provided by law to afford actual or constructive notice thereof.</p>

                  <p>(a) Any urban renewal plan may contain a provision that taxes, if any, levied upon taxable property in an urban renewal project each year by or for the benefit of a municipality in the state shall be divided as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) That portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each of the taxing agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the urban renewal project as shown upon the assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of the property by the taxing agency, last equalized prior to the effective date of the urban renewal project shall be allocated to and, when collected, paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes by or for those taxing agencies on all other property are paid (for the purpose of allocating taxes by or for any taxing agency which did not include the territory in the urban renewal project on the effective date of the project but which territory had been annexed or otherwise included after the effective date, the assessment of the county last equalized on the project shall be used in determining the assessed valuation on the taxable property in the project on the effective date); and</p>

Unless the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in an urban renewal project exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in the project as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of this section, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property in the urban renewal project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies.

                  <p>(a) There is created in each municipality a public body corporate and politic to be known as the "urban renewal agency" of the municipality. The urban renewal agency shall not exercise its powers under this chapter until or unless the local governing body has made the finding prescribed in W.S. 15-9-106 and has elected to have urban renewal powers exercised by an urban renewal agency as provided in W.S. 15-9-133.</p>
                  <p>(b) The mayor, by and with the consent and advice of the local governing body, shall appoint a board of five (5) commissioners of the urban renewal agency selected on the basis of their interest in and knowledge of community planning, urban renewal and business management. Any person may be appointed as commissioner if he resides within the area of operation of the agency (which shall have the same bounds or limits as the area of operation of the municipality) and is otherwise eligible for appointment under this chapter. The original appointment of commissioners shall be as follows: one (1) for a term of one (1) year; one (1) for a term of two (2) years; one (1) for a term of three (3) years; one (1) for a term of four (4) years; and one (1) for a term of five (5) years.

                  <p>(d) A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services but is entitled to necessary expenses incurred in the discharge of his duties. No commissioner or other officer of any urban renewal agency, board or commission exercising powers pursuant to this chapter shall hold any other public municipal office for which compensation is received.</p>
                  <p>(e) The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners constitute a quorum for all purposes. Action may be taken by the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws require a larger number. Annually, at the first meeting, the board of commissioners shall elect its officers. Each officer shall hold office for a term of one (1) year and until his successor is elected and qualified.</p>
                  <p>(f) A commissioner may be removed from office for inefficiency, neglect of duty or misconduct in office only after:</p>
                  <p>(i) A hearing;</p>

                  <p>(b) The governing body, in determining such costs, may include all costs and estimated costs of the issuance of the bonds; all engineering, inspection, fiscal and legal expenses; any discount on the sale of the bonds; the cost of any financial, professional or other expert advice; contingencies; any administrative, operating or other expenses of the municipality incurred pursuant to the issuance of the bonds, as may be determined by the governing body; all other expenses as may be necessary or incident to the financing, acquisition, improvement, equipment and completion of any development project or for furthering any purpose of this article; sufficient provision of reserves for working capital, operation, maintenance or replacement expense, or for payment or security of principal of or interest on any bonds during or after an acquisition or improvement, and equipment, as the governing body may determine; and reimbursements to any governmental agency or instrumentality for any monies expended pursuant to agreement on any project or for furthering any purpose of this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) In each project financed by the proceeds of bonds issued under this article, the governing body shall determine the costs of, and may budget a percentage of bond proceeds for, operation and administration of the project.</p>
                  <p>(d) The proceeds of the bonds may be expended by the municipality or, with the consent of the municipality, by the authority as agent for, and on behalf of, the municipality. If the proceeds of the bonds are applied for the acquisition of real or personal properties, the governing body may:</p>
                  <p>(i) Retain title to the properties in its own name, and lease or grant licenses or privileges in the properties to the authority in order that the authority may, as principal or agent, exercise its powers with respect to the properties; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) Convey title to the properties to the authority for such consideration and subject to such terms and conditions as the governing body may prescribe without regard to any restriction, limitation or condition otherwise imposed by statute on the sale or disposition of the properties by a municipality.</p>

                  <p>(a) Bonds issued pursuant to this article shall bear interest at a rate such that the net effective interest rate of the issue does not exceed the maximum net effective interest rate authorized, payable semiannually or annually, and evidenced by one (1) or two (2) sets of coupons, if any, executed with the facsimile or manually executed signature of any official of the municipality; except that the first coupon appertaining to any bond may evidence interest not in excess of one (1) year. The ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds shall specify the maximum net effective interest rate. The bonds may be issued as term or serial bonds, in one (1) or more series, may bear such date, may mature at such time not exceeding twenty (20) years duration, may be in such denomination or denominations, may be payable in such medium of payment at such place or places within or without the state (including but not limited to the office of any county treasurer in which the municipality is located wholly or in part), may carry such registration privileges, may be subject to such terms of prior redemption in advance of maturity in such order or by lot or otherwise at such time with or without a premium, may be executed in such manner, may bear such privileges for reissuance in the same or other denomination, may be so reissued, without modification of maturities and interest rates, and may be in such form, either bearer, coupon or registered, with such recitals, terms, covenants, conditions and other details as may be provided by the governing body, subject to the provisions of this article.</p>
                  <p>(b) The governing body may provide for preferential security for any bonds, both principal and interest, to be issued pursuant to this article to the extent deemed feasible and desirable by the governing body over any bonds that may be issued thereafter. The bonds may be sold at, above or below the principal amounts thereof, but they may not be sold at a price such that the net effective interest rate of the issue of bonds exceeds the maximum net effective interest rate authorized. The bonds may be sold at public or private sale as determined by the governing body to be in the best interest of the issuer. Bonds may be issued with privileges for conversion or registration, or both, for payment as to principal or interest, or both; and, where interest accruing on the bonds is not represented by interest coupons, the bonds may provide for the endorsing of payments of interest thereon.</p>
                  <p>(c) Subject to the payment provisions of this article, the bonds, any interest coupons attached thereto, and any temporary bonds shall be fully negotiable within the meaning of and for all the purposes of this article, except as the governing body may otherwise provide; and each holder of each security, by accepting the security, shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that the security, except as otherwise provided, is and shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of this article.</p>
                  <p>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the governing body in any proceedings authorizing bonds pursuant to this article:</p>
                  <p>(i) May provide for the initial issuance of one (1) or more bonds, referred to in this subsection as "bond", aggregating the amount of the entire issue;</p>
                  <p>(ii) May make such provision for installment payments of the principal amount of any such bond as it may consider desirable;</p>
                  <p>(iii) May provide for the making of any such bond, payable to bearer or otherwise, registrable as to principal or as to both principal and interest and, where interest accruing thereon is not represented by interest coupons, for the endorsing of payments of interest on such bonds;</p>
                  <p>(iv) May further make provision in any such proceedings for the manner and circumstances in and under which any such bond may in the future, at the request of the holder thereof, be converted into bonds of smaller denominations, which bonds of smaller denominations may in turn be either coupon bonds or bonds registrable as to principal, or principal and interest, or both.</p>
                  <p>(e) If lost or completely destroyed, any security authorized by this article may be reissued in the form and tenor of the lost or destroyed security upon the owner furnishing, to the satisfaction of the governing body, proof of ownership; proof of loss or destruction; a surety bond in twice the face amount of the security, including any unmatured coupons appertaining thereto; and payment of the cost of preparing and issuing the new security.</p>
                  <p>(f) Any officer authorized to execute any bond, after filing with the secretary of state his manual signature certified by him under oath, may execute or cause to be executed, with a facsimile signature in lieu of his manual signature, any bond authorized in this article, if such a filing is not a condition of execution with a facsimile signature of any interest coupon, and if at least one (1) signature required or permitted to be placed on each such bond, excluding any interest coupon, is manually subscribed. An officer's facsimile signature shall have the same legal effect as his manual signature.</p>
                  <p>(g) Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall constitute an indebtedness of the municipality within the meaning of constitutional and statutory limitations. However, each bond issued pursuant to this section shall recite in substance that the bond, including interest payable thereon, is payable solely from the revenues or special funds pledged to the payment thereof and the bond constitutes a limited obligation of the municipality.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>15-9-212. Refunding bonds; limited obligations.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) By ordinance adopted by the governing body at a regular or special meeting, by vote of a majority of the members of the governing body, any bonds issued under this article may be refunded by the municipality without an election, subject to the provisions concerning their payment and to any other contractual limitations in the proceedings authorizing their issuance or otherwise relating thereto. Any bonds issued for refunding purposes may either be delivered in exchange for the outstanding bonds authorized to be refunded or may be sold as provided in this article for the sale of other bonds.</p>
                  <p>(b) No bonds may be refunded under this article unless the holders thereof voluntarily surrender them for exchange or payment, or unless they either mature or are callable for prior redemption under their terms within ten (10) years from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds. Provision shall be made for paying the bonds within said period of time. No maturity of any bonds refunded may be extended over fifteen (15) years. The rate of interest on such refunding bonds shall be determined by the authority. The principal amount of the refunding bonds may exceed the principal amount of the refunded bonds if the aggregate principal and interest costs of the refunding bonds do not exceed such unaccrued costs of the bonds refunded, except to the extent any interest on the bonds refunded in arrears or about to become due is capitalized with the proceeds of the refunding bonds. The principal amount of the refunding bonds may also be less than or the same as the principal amount of the bonds refunded so long as provision is duly and sufficiently made for their payment.</p>
                  <p>(c) The proceeds of refunding bonds shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the bonds to be refunded or be placed in escrow or in trust to be applied to the payment of the bonds refunded upon their presentation. Any proceeds held in escrow or in trust pending use may be invested or reinvested in state or federal securities. The proceeds and investments in escrow or in trust, together with any interest or other gain to be derived from any investment, shall be in an amount at all times sufficient as to principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due and any charges of the escrow agent or trustee payable therefrom, to pay the bonds refunded as they become due at their respective maturities or due at the designated prior redemption date upon which the authority shall be obligated to call the refunded bonds for prior redemption.</p>
                  <p>(d) The relevant provisions pertaining to bonds generally shall be equally applicable in the authorization and issuance of refunding bonds, including their terms and security, the bond resolution, trust indenture, taxes and revenues, and other aspects of the bonds.</p>
                  <p>(e) Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall constitute an indebtedness of the municipality within the meaning of constitutional and statutory limitations. However, each bond issued pursuant to this section shall recite in substance that the bond, including interest payable thereon, is payable solely from the revenues or special funds pledged to the payment thereof and the bond constitutes a limited obligation of the municipality.</p>

                  <p>In addition to the bonds authorized pursuant to W.S. 15-9-212, the municipality may issue revenue bonds payable solely from legally available nontax revenues of the municipality. Except for the foregoing, bonds shall be issued pursuant to all the other provisions of W.S. 15-9-211. However, revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section shall not constitute an indebtedness of the municipality within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitations but an election of the qualified electors of the municipality shall be required for the issuance thereof. The election shall be called, conducted, canvassed and returned in the manner provided for bond elections by the Political Subdivision Bond Election Law, W.S. 22-21-101 through 22-21-112. Each revenue bond issued pursuant to this section shall recite in substance that the bond, including interest thereon, is payable solely from the nontax revenues or special funds pledged to the payment thereof and the bond does not constitute a debt of the municipality within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitations.</p>

The obligations are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, are exempt from taxes. The tax exemption provisions of this chapter are considered part of the contract for the security of the obligations authorized by this chapter and need not be restated in the obligations.</p>

                <p>(b) If the governing body of each of two (2) or more municipalities or counties, or combinations of municipalities and counties, has made the finding prescribed in W.S. 15-10-102, has taken the necessary action to cooperate with one another and has elected as provided in W.S. 15-10-115 to have its housing project powers exercised by a housing authority created for all the municipalities or counties so joining or cooperating, a public body corporate and politic to be known as a regional housing authority shall thereupon exist for all these municipalities or counties or combinations thereof. Additional municipalities or counties may elect to have the regional authority exercise their powers upon taking the actions specified in this subsection, and with the consent, by resolution, of all the municipalities and counties having elected to have their powers exercised by the regional authority.</p>
                <p>(c) If a housing authority has been created and authorized to exercise housing project powers, commissioners of the authority shall be appointed as follows:</p>
                <p>(i) In the case of a municipal housing authority, the mayor, with the advice and consent of the governing body, shall appoint five (5) persons as commissioners;</p>
                <p>(ii) In the case of a county housing authority, the governing body shall appoint five (5) commissioners. Commissioners who are first appointed to a municipal or county authority shall be designated to serve for terms of one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4) and five (5) years, respectively, from the date of their appointment. Thereafter commissioners shall be appointed as specified for a term of five (5) years and until their successors are chosen, except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term;</p>
                <p>(iii) In the case of a regional housing authority, the governing body of each municipality and county participating shall appoint one (1) person as a commissioner of the authority. If only two (2) municipalities or counties or a combination thereof are participating, the commissioners appointed by the governing bodies of the participants shall appoint one (1) additional commissioner. The commissioners of a regional authority shall be appointed for terms of five (5) years, except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term;</p>
                <p>(iv) Each commissioner shall qualify by taking the official oath of office prescribed by general statute;</p>
                <p>(v) A commissioner shall not receive compensation for his services but is entitled to reimbursement for necessary expenses incurred in the discharge of his duties;</p>
                <p>(vi) Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the authority, and this certificate is conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of the commissioner.</p>
                <p>(d) The powers of each authority are vested in the commissioners. The commissioners shall elect from among their members a chairman and vice chairman. A majority of the commissioners of an authority constitute a quorum for all purposes, notwithstanding the existence of any vacancies. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority require a larger number. Meetings of the commissioners of an authority may be held anywhere within the area of operation of the authority or within any additional area in which the authority is authorized to undertake a project.</p>
                <p>(e) An authority may employ an executive director, legal and technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees as it requires, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. An authority may delegate to one (1) or more of its agents or employees any powers or duties it deems proper.</p>
                <p>(f) In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, an authority is conclusively deemed to be established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers upon proof of compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(i) or</p>
                <p>(ii) of this section, as the case may be. A copy of the resolutions required to be adopted by the governing body electing to have its housing project powers exercised by a housing authority shall be filed with the clerk. A copy of the resolution duly certified by the clerk is admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.</p>
