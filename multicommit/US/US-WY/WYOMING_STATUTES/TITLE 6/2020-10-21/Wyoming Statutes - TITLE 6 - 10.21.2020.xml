                  <p>(a) Self-induced intoxication of the defendant is not a defense to a criminal charge except to the extent that in any prosecution evidence of self-induced intoxication of the defendant may be offered when it is relevant to negate the existence of a specific intent which is an element of the crime.</p>
                  <p>(b) Intoxication is self-induced if it is caused by substances which the defendant knows or ought to know have the tendency to cause intoxication and which he knowingly and voluntarily introduced or allowed to be introduced into his body unless they were introduced pursuant to medical advice. The fact that the defendant is dependent upon the intoxicating substance is not relevant in determining whether his intoxication is self- induced.</p>

Upon the filing of the motion the court shall hold a hearing prior to trial and shall grant the person's motion if he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he used reasonable defensive force under W.S. 6-2-602.</p>
                  <p>(c) A court shall award reasonable attorney fees, court costs, compensation for any loss of income and all other expenses incurred by a person in defense of any civil action arising from the person's use of reasonable defensive force pursuant to W.S. 6-2-602 if the court finds that the defendant is immune from civil action under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if:</p>
                  <p>(i) With the intent to commit the crime, he does any act which is a substantial step towards commission of the crime. A "substantial step" is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the person's intention to complete the commission of the crime; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) He intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime had the attendant circumstances been as the person believes them to be.</p>
                  <p>(b) A person is not liable under this section if, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intention, he avoided the commission of the crime attempted by abandoning his criminal effort. Within the meaning of this subsection, renunciation of criminal purpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the person's course of conduct, which increase the probability of detection or apprehension or which make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal intention. Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.</p>

                  <p>(b) A person is not liable under this section if, after soliciting another person to commit a crime, he persuaded the other person not to do so or otherwise prevented the commission of the crime, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intention.</p>

                  <p>(a) Upon conviction of a person for murder in the first degree in a case in which the state seeks the death penalty, the judge shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, life imprisonment without parole or life imprisonment. The hearing shall be conducted before the judge alone if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The defendant was convicted by a judge sitting without a jury;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The defendant has pled guilty; or</p>
                  <p>(iii) The defendant waives a jury with respect to the sentence.</p>
                  <p>(b) In all other cases the sentencing hearing shall be conducted before the jury which determined the defendant's guilt or, if the judge for good cause shown discharges that jury, with a new jury impaneled for that purpose. The jury shall be instructed that if the jury does not unanimously determine that the defendant should be sentenced to death, then the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole or life imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>(c) The judge or jury shall hear evidence as to any matter that the court deems relevant to a determination of the sentence, and shall include matters relating to any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances enumerated in subsections (h) and (j) of this section. Any evidence which the court deems to have probative value may be received regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence, provided the defendant is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay statements, and provided further that only such evidence in aggravation as the state has made known to the defendant or his counsel prior to his trial shall be admissible.</p>
                  <p>(d) Upon conclusion of the evidence and arguments the judge shall give the jury appropriate instructions, including instructions as to any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, as defined in subsections (h) and (j) of this section, or proceed as provided by paragraph (iii) of this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(i) After hearing all the evidence, the jury shall deliberate and render a sentence based upon the following:</p>
                  <p>(A) Whether one (1) or more aggravating circumstances exist beyond a reasonable doubt as set forth in subsection (h) of this section;</p>
                  <p>(B) Whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, mitigating circumstances exist as set forth in subsection (j) of this section; and</p>
                  <p>(C) The mere number of aggravating or mitigating circumstances found shall have no independent significance.</p>
                  <p>(ii) The jury shall consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances unanimously found to exist, and each individual juror may also consider any mitigating circumstances found by that juror to exist. If the jury reports unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of death. If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict imposing the sentence of death within a reasonable time, the court shall instruct the jury to determine by a unanimous vote whether the penalty of life imprisonment without parole shall be imposed. If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict imposing the penalty of life imprisonment without parole within a reasonable time, the court shall discharge the jury and impose the sentence of life imprisonment;</p>
                  <p>(iii) In nonjury cases, the judge shall determine if any aggravating or mitigating circumstances exist and impose sentence within the limits prescribed by law, based upon the considerations enumerated in subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) of paragraph (i) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p>(e) The death penalty shall not be imposed unless at least one (1) of the aggravating circumstances set forth in subsection</p>
                  <p>(h) of this section is found. In nonjury cases the judge shall make such designation. The jury, if its verdict is a sentence of death, shall designate in writing signed by the foreman of the jury:</p>
                  <p>(i) The aggravating circumstance or circumstances which it unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The mitigating circumstance or circumstances which it unanimously found by a preponderance of the evidence; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) The mitigating circumstance or circumstances which any individual juror found by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
                  <p>(f) Repealed By Laws 2001, Ch. 96, § 3.</p>
                  <p>(g) If the trial court is reversed on appeal because of error only in the presentence hearing, the new trial which may be ordered shall apply only to the issue of punishment.</p>
                  <p>(h) Aggravating circumstances are limited to the following:</p>

                  <p>(i) A written motion shall be made by the defendant to the court at least ten (10) days prior to the trial stating that the defense has an offer of proof of the relevancy of evidence of the sexual conduct of the victim and its relevancy to the defense;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The written motion shall be accompanied by affidavits in which the offer of proof is stated;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If the court finds the offer of proof sufficient, the court shall order a hearing in chambers, and at the hearing allow the questioning of the victim regarding the offer of proof made by the defendant and other pertinent evidence;</p>
                  <p>(iv) At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs the probability that its admission will create prejudice, the evidence shall be admissible pursuant to this section.

                  <p>(ii) The person sought to be removed is a child or grandchild, or is otherwise in the lawful custody or under the lawful guardianship of, the person against whom the defensive force is used; or</p>

Official documentation of the defendant's status as a victim at the time of the offense from a federal, state or local government agency shall create a presumption that the defendant's participation in the offense was a result of having been a victim, but shall not be required for granting a motion under this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) As soon as possible after the initial encounter with a person who reasonably appears to a law enforcement agency, district or county and prosecuting attorneys' office to be a victim of human trafficking, the agency or office shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Notify the victim services division within the office of the attorney general that the person may be eligible for services under this article; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) Make a preliminary assessment of whether the victim or possible victim of human trafficking appears to meet the criteria for certification as a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons as defined in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 22 U.S.C. section 7105, or appears to be otherwise eligible for any federal, state or local benefits and services. If it is determined that the victim appears to meet such criteria, the agency or office shall report the finding to the victim and shall refer the victim to services available, including legal service providers. If the possible victim is a minor or is a vulnerable adult, the agency or office shall also notify the department of family services.</p>
                  <p>(b) The attorney general, a district or county and prosecuting attorney or any law enforcement official shall certify in writing to the United States Department of Justice or other federal agency, such as the United States Department of Homeland Security, that an investigation or prosecution under this article has begun and the individual who is a likely victim of a crime described in this article is willing to cooperate or is cooperating with the investigation to enable the individual, if eligible under federal law, to qualify for an appropriate special immigrant visa and to access available federal benefits. Cooperation with law enforcement shall not be required of victims of a crime described in this article who are minors. This certification shall be made available to the victim and the victim's designated legal representative.</p>
                  <p>(c) Victims of human trafficking under W.S. 6-2-702 through 6-2-706 shall be informed of the rights enumerated in this section, the victim's right to informed consent and the victim's rights as a victim of crime. The victim shall also be informed of available housing, educational, medical, legal and advocacy services.</p>
                  <p>(d) Victims of human trafficking are entitled to restitution and forms of compensation under the Crime Victims Compensation Act.</p>
                  <p>(e) In a prosecution for an offense under this article, police and prosecuting agencies shall keep the identity of the victim and the victim's family confidential. The prosecutor shall take reasonable steps to protect the victim and the victim's family from being revictimized.</p>

                  <p>(b) If the victim of human trafficking to whom restitution has been ordered dies before restitution is paid, any restitution ordered shall be paid to the victim's heir or legal representative provided that the heir or legal representative has not benefited in any way from the trafficking.</p>
                  <p>(c) The return of the victim of human trafficking to the victim's home country or other absence of the victim from the jurisdiction shall not limit the victim's right to receive restitution pursuant to this section.</p>

                  <p>(a) The following are subject to forfeiture as permitted pursuant to subsections (c) through (j) of this section:</p>

                  <p>(iii) All conveyances including aircraft, vehicles or vessels, knowingly used or intended for use to transport victims or in any manner to knowingly facilitate transportation of victims for human trafficking in violation of this article are subject to forfeiture, provided:</p>
                  <p>(A) No conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as a common carrier is subject to forfeiture under this section unless the owner or corporate officer is a consenting party or privy to a violation of this article;</p>
                  <p>(B) No conveyance is subject to forfeiture under this section by reason of any act committed without the knowledge or consent of the owner;</p>
                  <p>(C) A forfeiture of a conveyance encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest if the secured party neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act.</p>
                  <p>(iv) All buildings knowingly used or intended for use to further human trafficking in violation of this article if the owner has knowledge of or gives consent to the act of violation. A forfeiture of property encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest if the secured party neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act;</p>
                  <p>(v) Any property or other thing of pecuniary value furnished in exchange for human trafficking in violation of this article including any proceeds, assets or other property of any kind traceable to the exchange and any money, securities or other negotiable instruments used to facilitate a violation of this article. Property used or furnished without the consent or knowledge of the owner is not forfeitable under this paragraph to the extent of the owner's interest;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Overseas assets of persons convicted of human trafficking under this article to the extent they can be retrieved by the state.</p>
                  <p>(b) Property subject to forfeiture under this article may be seized by any law enforcement officer of the state upon process issued by any district or circuit court having jurisdiction over the property. Seizure without process may be made if:</p>
                  <p>(i) The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search under a search warrant or an inspection under an administrative inspection warrant; or</p>
                  <p>(ii) The property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state in a criminal, injunction or forfeiture proceeding based upon this article.</p>
                  <p>(c) Any person convicted of a violation of this article which is punishable by imprisonment for more than one (1) year shall be subject to forfeiture of property listed under subsection (a) of this section. The procedure for forfeiture shall be as provided in subsections (d) through (j) of this section.</p>
                  <p>(d) If the state seeks forfeiture of property:</p>
                  <p>(i) The indictment or information shall contain notice to the defendant that the state seeks forfeiture and shall specifically identify the property sought to be forfeited;</p>
                  <p>(ii) All property shall be returned to the legal owner or person from whom it was seized unless there is a finding or verdict of guilt, an admission of guilt or a plea of nolo contendere to a felony under this act;</p>
                  <p>(iii) After a finding or verdict of guilt, an admission of guilt or a plea of nolo contendere to a felony under this act is accepted, the court shall conduct a forfeiture hearing to determine if the property is subject to forfeiture under this section. If the court finds under a preponderance of evidence standard that property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall enter a preliminary order directing the forfeiture;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The court may include in the preliminary order of forfeiture additional conditions reasonably necessary to preserve the property's value pending any appeal.</p>
                  <p>(e) If the court makes a preliminary order of forfeiture of property, legal interests of persons other than a party to the criminal action shall be determined, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) Following an entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture, the state shall publish notice of the order in a newspaper of general circulation in the state once a week for two (2) weeks and shall provide written notice by first class mail to the last known address of any person who, after reasonable inquiry, appears to be a potential owner or lien holder in the property. The notice shall describe the forfeited property and shall advise that parties with a potential interest in the property may contest the forfeiture by filing a petition with the court not later than sixty (60) days after the date of the second published notice or, if notice is mailed under this paragraph, not later than thirty (30) days after mailing written notice;</p>
                  <p>(ii) If a third party files a timely response asserting an interest in property subject to a preliminary order of forfeiture, the court shall conduct a hearing. The court may permit the parties to conduct discovery in accordance with the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure if the court determines that discovery is necessary or desirable to resolve factual issues. After the hearing, the court shall enter a final order of forfeiture by amending the preliminary order as necessary to account for any third party rights. If no third party files a timely petition, the preliminary order shall become the final order upon expiration of the time for filing a petition;</p>
                  <p>(iii) If a defendant appeals from a conviction or a preliminary or final order of forfeiture, the court may stay the preliminary or final order of forfeiture on terms appropriate to ensure that the property remains available pending appellate review. A stay shall not delay a hearing or a determination of a third party's rights or interests. If the court rules in favor of any third party while an appeal is pending, the court may amend the order of forfeiture but shall not transfer any property interest to a third party until the decision on appeal becomes final, unless the defendant consents in writing or on the record.</p>
                  <p>(f) An interest in property belonging to a third party shall not be forfeited to the extent that the third party establishes it has a perfected lien in the property or proves by a preponderance of evidence that he has a perfected security interest in the property or proves he is an innocent owner. For purposes of this subsection:</p>
                  <p>(i) With respect to a property interest in existence at the time the violation of this article took place, "innocent owner" means a person who held an interest in the property who neither had knowledge of nor consented to the violation;</p>
                  <p>(ii) With respect to a property interest acquired after the violation of this article has taken place, the term "innocent owner" means a person who, at the time that person acquired the interest in the property:</p>
                  <p>(A) Was a bona fide purchaser or seller for value or a holder of a bona fide security interest in the property; and</p>
                  <p>(B) Did not know and was reasonably without cause to believe the property was used in connection with a violation of this article.</p>
                  <p>(g) Property taken or detained under this section shall not be subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of and subject only to the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the proceedings. When property is seized under this section, the court shall place the property under seal or otherwise assure the property is maintained under conditions reasonably necessary to preserve the property's value or may sell the property for value and hold the proceeds thereof until the forfeiture proceedings have become final as to all parties and all rights of appeal have been exhausted.</p>
                  <p>(h) A person's interest in property is not subject to forfeiture to the extent that the forfeiture is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture. The state shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that a forfeiture is not grossly disproportionate. Proportionality shall be decided by the court as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) In determining whether a forfeiture is grossly disproportionate, the court shall consider:</p>
                  <p>(A) The extent to which the property was used or intended to be used in executing the underlying offense;</p>
                  <p>(B) The value of the property, including both its fair market and subjective value;</p>
                  <p>(C) The actions of the person involved in the activity giving rise to the forfeiture proceedings;</p>
                  <p>(D) The severity of the criminal sanctions associated with the actions of the person;</p>
                  <p>(E) Whether the property constitutes the person's lawful livelihood or means of earning a living;</p>
                  <p>(F) Whether the offense or attempted offense has severe collateral consequences; and</p>
                  <p>(G) Any other factors the court deems necessary and relevant.</p>
                  <p>(ii) If the court finds the forfeiture is grossly disproportionate to the offense, it shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture as it finds appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(j) Within six (6) months after a final order of forfeiture is affirmed on appeal or the deadline to appeal passes without a notice of appeal being filed, the state shall, by public sale or auction, liquidate forfeited tangible property and distribute the total proceeds of the forfeiture as follows:</p>
                  <p>(i) Costs of forfeiture proceedings and the sale of forfeited property incurred by the state;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Costs of storing and maintaining the forfeited property incurred by the court;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The amount necessary to pay court ordered restitution shall be applied to pay that restitution;</p>
                  <p>(iv) Civil judgments entered against the forfeiting defendant in favor of that defendant's victim, already existing at the time proceeds are received, to the extent that such judgments cannot be satisfied out of the forfeiting defendant's assets;</p>
                  <p>(v) If a remainder exists, to the public school fund of the respective counties as provided by article 7, section 5 of the Wyoming constitution.</p>

An application for a permit or renewal under this subsection shall be filed with the division of criminal investigation and accepted during active military service outside the state. Members of the armed forces who are deployed outside the United States and whose permits expire during their term of deployment shall be permitted to renew their permits through the deployment period and not later than six (6) months after returning to the United States after deployment. An expired permit which is not renewed prior to the end of the extended period provided in this subsection shall be deemed to be permanently expired as provided in subsection (s) of this section.

                  <p><shortTitle>6-8-404. Regulation by state of firearms, firearms accessories, ammunition and antique firearms manufactured in Wyoming; exceptions.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) A personal firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in Wyoming and that remains exclusively within the borders of Wyoming is not subject to federal law, federal taxation or federal regulation, including registration, under the authority of the United States congress to regulate interstate commerce. It is declared by the Wyoming legislature that those items have not traveled in interstate commerce. This section applies to a firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured in Wyoming from basic materials and that can be manufactured without the inclusion of any significant parts imported from another state or foreign country. Generic and insignificant parts that have other manufacturing or consumer product applications are not firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition, and their importation into Wyoming and incorporation into a firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition manufactured in Wyoming does not subject the firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition to federal regulation. It is declared by the Wyoming legislature that basic industrial materials, such as, but not limited to, polymers, unmachined metal, ferrous or nonferrous, bar stock, ingots or forgings and unshaped wood, are not firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition and are not subject to congressional authority to regulate firearms, firearms accessories and ammunition under interstate commerce as if they were actually firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition. The authority of the United States congress to regulate interstate commerce in basic materials does not include authority to regulate firearms, firearm accessories and ammunition made within Wyoming borders from those materials. Firearms accessories that are imported into Wyoming from another state and that are subject to federal regulation as being in interstate commerce do not subject a firearm to federal regulation under interstate commerce because the firearm accessory is attached to or used in conjunction with a firearm in Wyoming.</p>
                  <p>(b) A firearm manufactured or sold in Wyoming under this act shall have the words, "made in Wyoming" clearly stamped, inscribed or otherwise marked on a central part of the firearm, such as the receiver or frame.</p>
                  <p>(c) To possess a firearm covered by this section a person shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Not have been convicted of any felony in any state, territory or other jurisdiction of the United States. This paragraph shall not apply to antique firearms;</p>
                  <p>(ii) Not currently be adjudicated to be legally incompetent; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) Not have been committed to a mental institution.</p>
                  <p>(d) To purchase a firearm covered by this section a person shall:</p>
                  <p>(i) Be at least:</p>
                  <p>(A) Twenty-one (21) years of age if the firearm is a handgun;</p>
                  <p>(B) Eighteen (18) years of age if the firearm is a shotgun or rifle.</p>
                  <p>(ii) Not have been convicted of any felony in any state, territory or other jurisdiction of the United States. This paragraph shall not apply to antique firearms;</p>
                  <p>(iii) Not currently be adjudicated to be legally incompetent; and</p>
                  <p>(iv) Not have been committed to a mental institution.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>6-8-406. Legislative findings and declaration of authority.</shortTitle></p>
                  <p>(a) The legislature declares that the authority for W.S. 6-8-402 through 6-8-406 is the following:</p>
                  <p>(i) The tenth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees to the states and their people all powers not granted to the federal government elsewhere in the constitution and reserves to the state and the people of Wyoming certain powers as they were understood at the time that Wyoming was admitted to statehood in 1890. The guaranty of those powers is a matter of contract between the state and people of Wyoming and the several states comprising the United States as of the time the Act of Admission was agreed upon and adopted by Wyoming and the several states comprising the United States in 1889;</p>
                  <p>(ii) The ninth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees to the people rights not granted in the constitution and reserves to the people of Wyoming certain rights, as they were understood at the time Wyoming was admitted to statehood in 1890. The guaranty of those rights is a matter of contract between the state and people of Wyoming and the several states comprising the United States as of the time the Act of Admission was agreed upon and adopted by Wyoming and the United States in 1889;</p>
                  <p>(iii) The regulation of intrastate commerce is vested in the states under the ninth and tenth amendments to the United States constitution, particularly if not expressly preempted by federal law pursuant to article 1, section 8 of the United States constitution. The United States congress has not expressly preempted state regulation of intrastate commerce pertaining to the manufacture on an intrastate basis of firearms, firearms accessories and ammunition;</p>
                  <p>(iv) The second amendment to the United States constitution reserves to the people the right to keep and bear arms as that right was understood at the time the original states ratified the bill of rights to the United States constitution, and the guaranty of the right is a matter of contract between the state and people of Wyoming and the United States as of the time the Act of Admission was agreed upon and adopted by Wyoming and the United States in 1889;</p>
                  <p>(v) Article 1, section 24, of the Wyoming constitution secures the right of citizens the right to keep and bear arms and this right shall not be denied. This right predates the United States constitution and the Wyoming constitution and is unchanged from the 1890 Wyoming constitution, which was approved by congress and the people of Wyoming, and the right exists, as it was agreed upon and adopted by Wyoming and the United States in the Act of Admission;</p>
                  <p>(vi) Article 1, section 1, of the Wyoming constitution provides that all power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety and happiness; for all the advancement of these ends they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper;</p>
                  <p>(vii) Article 1, section 7, of the Wyoming constitution provides that absolute, arbitrary power over the lives, liberty and property of freemen exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest majority;</p>
                  <p>(viii) Article 1, sections 1 and 7, of the Wyoming constitution clearly provide that the people of the state have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free, sovereign and independent state, and do so and forever hereafter shall exercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction and right, pertaining thereto, which is not, or may not hereafter be, by them expressly delegated to the United States of America;</p>
                  <p>(ix) The declaration of independence clearly provides that government derives its power directly from the consent of the governed and Wyoming affirms the language of the second paragraph of the declaration of independence which states "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...".</p>
