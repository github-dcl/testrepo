                  <p>All contracts entered into, renewed, or extended by Class A, B, and D licensees and their contractors for goods, services, and events occurring during the live race meeting are subject to prior approval by the commission. Licensees must submit contracts to the commission not less than seven days prior to a commission meeting. Contracts must include a current Certificate of Compliance, if applicable, issued by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. Contracts must include a statement by the contractor affirming compliance with the ADA, if applicable. All Class A, B, and D licensees must submit as soon as practicable to the commission the name and the address of the contractor or subcontractor, amount and duration of the contract or subcontract, and a description of the good or service provided. The commission shall determine whether the contract or subcontract may affect the integrity of pari-mutuel racing, and the commission shall notify the licensee whether the commission intends to review and approve or disapprove the contract or subcontract. In making a determination that a contract or subcontract may affect the integrity of racing, the commission shall consider the amount and duration; the extent to which the contractor or subcontractor will be on the premises of the licensee; the relationship of the contract or subcontract to security; opportunity for contact between the contractor or subcontractor and horses, horsepersons, or patrons; opportunity for the contractor or subcontractor to influence the management and conduct of pari-mutuel racing; contact with admission, pari-mutuel, concession, or purse money; and whether the commission has reason to believe that the contractor or subcontractor is incompetent, financially irresponsible, or not of good character. If notified of the commission's intention to review and approve or disapprove a contract or subcontract, the licensee shall promptly submit to the commission copies of any written contracts or subcontracts as well as any documentation, records, or information the commission may request with regard to the contract. If the commission notifies a licensee of the commission's intention to review and approve or disapprove a contract or subcontract, the contract or subcontract is not valid, nor is either of the parties bound by the contract until it has been approved by the commission. The commission shall approve or disapprove contracts and subcontracts within 30 days, as computed pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 645.15, after submission.</p>

The commission, at any time, may by written notice to affected licensees, rescind its decision not to review contracts and subcontracts of certain types, amounts, or durations and require submission of the information required in subpart 1 if it determines that the integrity of pari-mutuel racing is affected.</p>

                  <p>A. In the event that wagers are not accepted at the host track, the guest track shall pay the host track prices on affected single-race pools. The funds derived from the wagers shall be applied to the payment of the affected winning tickets. The guest and host tracks along with the totalizator companies shall resolve any resulting liabilities among themselves. Underpayments may be used to offset overpayments generated during a calendar year. Any resulting surplus at the close of wagering on December 31st of a calendar year must be added into a net wagering pool, chosen by the association and approved by the commission in accordance with part 7873.0110, subpart 3, on the first live racing day of the following meet. If there is a deficit at the close of wagering on December 31st of a calendar year, that deficit will be the starting point for which the following year's cumulative total begins. The mutuel department or tote representative or both must submit to the commission a complete report of payments made to winning ticket holders resulting in any surplus or liability. This report must also summarize the yearly total of accumulated surpluses and liabilities. This report must be submitted to the commission within 48 hours of the failure.</p>
                  <p>B. In the event that wagers are not accepted at the host track, the guest track shall refund wagers on affected multiple-race pools.</p>

                  <p>C. If there is a two horse dead heat for place in a quinella race, the total pool is calculated as a place pool.</p>
                  <p>D. If a multiple dead heat for place results in a quinella race, all combinations coupling the winning horse with the individual place horses shall be winners of the quinella race and payoffs calculated accordingly.</p>

                  <p>The following calculations shall be used in the event of dead heats.</p>
                  <p>A. In case of a dead heat between two horses for first place, the net pool shall be calculated and distributed as a place pool to holders of tickets of the winning combination. Example: if numbers 2 and 5 dead heat for win, the winning combination would be 2-5 and 5-2.</p>
                  <p>B. In case of a dead heat between two horses for second place, the pool shall be figured as a place pool, the holders of tickets combining the winning horse and the two horses finishing second participating in the payoff. Example: if number 2 wins with numbers 5 and 6 a dead heat for second, the winning combinations would be 2-5 and 2-6.</p>
                  <p>C. If there is a dead heat for second place, if no ticket is sold on one of the two winning combinations, the entire net pool shall be calculated as a win pool and distributed to those holding tickets on the other winning combination. Example: if number 2 won and numbers 5 and 6 were a dead heat for second, 2-5 and 2-6 would be the winning combination. However, if no ticket was sold with a 2-5 combination, the net pool would be distributed to holders of the 2-6 combination.</p>
                  <p>D. If no tickets combine the winning horse with either of the place horses in the dead heat, the pool shall be calculated and distributed as a place pool to holders of tickets representing any interest in the net pool. Example: if number 2 won and numbers 5 and 6 were a dead heat for second, 2-5 and 2-6 would be the winning combinations. However, if no ticket was sold with the 2-5 or 2-6 combination, the net pool would be distributed to holders of any ticket with 2 in the win position as part of the combination with any other number (2-1, 2-3, 2-4, 2-7, 2-8 of an eight horse field) and to holders of any ticket with 5 or 6 in the place position with any other number (1-5, 3-5, 4-5, 6-5, 7-5, 8-5, 1-6, 3-6, 4-6, 5-6, 7-6, 8-6 of an eight horse field).</p>

                  <p>A. The place pick all pari-mutuel pool must be calculated according to one of the two methods provided in item B or C, as approved by the commission.</p>
                  <p>B. One hundred percent of the net amount in the pari-mutuel pool subject to distribution among winning ticket holders shall be distributed among the holders of pari-mutuel tickets which correctly designate the most winning selections officially finishing first or second in each of the races comprising that day's racing program.</p>
                  <p>C. (1) One hundred percent of the net amount in the pari-mutuel pool subject to distribution among winning ticket holders shall be distributed among the holders of pari-mutuel tickets which correctly designate a horse that officially finishes first or second in each of the races comprising that day's racing program.</p>
                  <p>(2) In the event there is no pari-mutuel ticket properly issued which correctly designates a horse that officially finishes first or second in each of the races comprising that day's racing program, 75 percent of the pari-mutuel pool shall not be distributed but shall be retained by the association as a distributable amount and shall be carried over and included in the place pick all pari-mutuel pool for the next succeeding racing date as an additional net amount to be distributed among the holders of pari-mutuel tickets which correctly designate the official winner in each of the four races comprising the pick four pool that day. The remaining 25 percent shall be distributed among the holders of place pick all tickets that correctly designate the most horses officially finishing first or second in each of the races comprising that day's racing program.</p>
                  <p>D. The method of distribution shall be selected by the racing association and implemented after approval by the commission provided that the method of distribution benefits the wagering public and does not adversely affect the integrity of racing.</p>
                  <p>E. Should no distribution be made pursuant to item B or C on the last day of the association's meeting, then the entire distributable pool and all money accumulated in the pool shall be distributed to the holders of tickets correctly designating the most winning selections of the races comprising the place pick all for that day. If, for any reason, the final day of racing is canceled or the place pick all pool has not been distributed, the pool shall be escrowed by the association, and the pool, as well as all accrued interest, shall be carried over and included in the place pick all pari-mutuel pool for the next succeeding racing date as an additional net amount to be distributed.</p>

If there are no such wagers, a designated percentage of the net pool shall be distributed as a single-price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests and the remainder shall be added to the carryover.</p>
                  <p>B.

The minor share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed to those who selected the first place finisher in the second greatest number of Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish. If there are no wagers selecting the first place finisher of all Pick (n) contests, the minor share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed as a single-price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests and the major share shall be added to the carryover.</p>
                  <p>D. Method 4, Pick (n) with no minor pool and no carryover: The net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed as a single-price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish. If there are no winning wagers, the pool is refunded.</p>
                  <p>E. Method 5, Pick (n) with minor pool and no carryover: The major share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish. The minor share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed to those who selected the first place finisher in the second greatest number of Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish. If there are no wagers selecting the first place finisher in the second greatest number of Pick (n) contests, the minor share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be combined with the major share for distribution as a single-price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests. If the greatest number of first place finishers selected is one, the major and minor shares are combined for distribution as a single-price pool.

The minor share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed to those who selected the first place finisher in the second greatest number of Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish. If there are no wagers selecting the first place finisher in all Pick (n) contests, the entire net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed as a single-price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests. If there are no wagers selecting the first place finisher in the second greatest number of Pick (n) contests, the minor share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be combined with the major share for distribution as a single-price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in each of the Pick (n) contests. If there are no winning wagers, the pool is refunded.</p>
                  <p>G. Method 7, Pick (n) with carryover and "unique winning ticket" provision: The net Pick (n) pool and carryover, if any, shall be distributed to the holder of a unique winning ticket that selected the first place finisher in each of the Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish. If there is no unique ticket selecting the first place finisher in each of the Pick (n) contests, or if there are no wagers selecting the first place finisher of all Pick (n) contests, the major share of the net Pick (n) pool shall be distributed as a single price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests, and the remainder shall be added to the carryover. Associations may suspend previously approved unique winning ticket wagering with the prior approval of the commission. Any carryover shall be held until the suspended unique winning ticket wagering is reinstated. Where there is no correct selection of the first place finisher in at least one of the Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish, the day's net pool shall be refunded and the previous carryover pool amount, if any, shall be carried over to the next scheduled corresponding pool. In obtaining authorization for operating the Pick (n) pool under this subpart, associations must clearly identify which definition under subpart 7a, item B, will be relied upon for determining the existence of a unique winning ticket.</p>

                  <p>As it relates to any distribution under Method 7 which contains a unique winning ticket provision:</p>
                  <p>A. a written request for permission to distribute the Pick (n) unique winning ticket carryover on a specific race day must be submitted to the commission's director, deputy director, or director of pari-mutuels at least three days prior to the race day. The request must contain justification for the distribution, an explanation of the benefit to be derived, and the intended race day for the distribution. Should the Pick (n) unique winning ticket net pool and any applicable carryover be designated for distribution on a specified race day in which there is no unique winning ticket, the entire pool shall be distributed as a single price pool to those who selected the first place finisher in the greatest number of Pick (n) contests; and</p>
                  <p>B. associations must clearly identify for the public which selection under subitems (1) and (2) will be relied upon for determining the existence of a unique winning ticket:</p>
                  <p>(1) there is one and only one winning ticket that correctly selected the first place finisher in each of the Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish, to be verified by the unique serial number assigned by the tote company that issued the winning ticket; or</p>
                  <p>(2) the total amount wagered on one and only one winning combination selecting the first place finisher in each of the Pick (n) contests, based upon the official order of finish, is equal to the minimum allowable wager.</p>

                  <p>In the absence of a contract or special agreement, drivers' fees shall be $20 or five percent of the purse earned, whichever is greater.</p>
                  <p>A. For the purpose of this subpart "purse earned" means the amount paid the winning horse less the fees paid by the owner to enter the horse in the race.</p>
                  <p>B. The purpose of this subpart is not to set a minimum or a maximum fee, but merely to provide a fee in the event that the parties have not made any other written agreement to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>A driver's fee shall be considered earned when the horse which the driver has been engaged to drive leaves the paddock for the post; provided, however, that in the event of a substitution of drivers after the fee is considered earned, no additional driver fee or double driver fee need be paid except when so ordered by the stewards.</p>
                  <p>C. In the event the parties reach an agreement with respect to the fee to be paid the driver, a contract or agreement in writing signed by the driver (or his or her agent) and the owner (or his or her authorized agent) specifying the agreed upon fee shall be delivered to the horsepersons' bookkeeper prior to the running of the race in question. The horsepersons' bookkeeper shall debit the owner's account in accordance with the contract or written agreement.</p>
                  <p>D. If no contract or written agreement is submitted to the horsepersons' bookkeeper prior to the running of the race in question, the horseperson's bookkeeper shall debit the owner's purse account in accordance with the applicable fees found in this subpart.</p>

                  <p>If a racing official approved by the commission becomes incapacitated or is unable to perform his or her duties, the stewards may approve an emergency license. The approval shall be based on the standards in part 7877.0175, and must be reported to the commission for consideration at the next commission meeting. If the emergency licensee has not previously been considered by the commission, the association shall be responsible for immediately submitting a completed license application and personal resume to the commission.</p>

                  <p>If an owner is unable to complete an application for an owner's license because of absence or illness, the licensed trainer desiring to enter a horse in a race shall be permitted to apply for an emergency owner's license on behalf of the absent owner.</p>
                  <p>The trainer must, at the time of submission for an emergency owner's license, provide at least the following information: the owner's full name, home or business address, telephone number, and Social Security number, Social Insurance Number, tax identification number, or foreign equivalent. At the time of application, the appropriate licensing fee must be paid to the commission. Failure to provide all of the foregoing information is grounds for denial of an emergency owner's license. An emergency owner's license shall expire 21 days from the date it is issued.</p>
                  <p>Prior to the expiration of the emergency owner's license, the owner must submit a properly completed owner's application as required by parts 7877.0110 and 7877.0130. Failure to do so is grounds for forfeiture of any purse money won by the owner when racing under the emergency license. In addition, if the required information is not submitted due to an act or omission on the part of the trainer, the trainer may also be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

                <p>D. The licensee will notify the stewards or the commission immediately about any bribe, attempted bribe, cheating, or any violation of a statute or rule relating to horse racing or gambling of which he or she has knowledge.</p>
                <p>E. The licensee will submit to inspections and searches, and to the seizure of any items reasonably suspected to be prohibited by law or the commission's rules, as hereinafter provided:</p>
                <p>(1) When investigating for violations of law or rules upon the grounds of an association, the commission or the stewards may designate the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement Division or another appropriate law enforcement agency as having authority to conduct searches of any Class C licensee, or any employee or agent of a Class A, B, or D licensee under the commission's jurisdiction. This authority shall extend to searches, seizures, and inspections of persons and personal effects in and about grounds.</p>
                <p>(2) Each applicant for a Class C license and each employee or agent of a Class A, B, or D licensee consents to such searches, seizures, and inspections, and waives all claims or possible actions for damages that he or she believes he or she may have suffered in connection with any such search, seizure, or inspection.</p>
                <p>F. The licensee will, upon request of the commission, the commission's director of security, or the stewards, provide a blood, breath, saliva, or urine sample for analysis if the duties of the licensee place him or her in a position of danger or he or she commits an act that endangers a horse or human.</p>

                  <p>(3) The record shall be maintained electronically or on paper until the end of the calendar year in which the trainer is licensed by the commission.</p>
                  <p>(4) The record must be made available for inspection upon request of the commission, stewards, or commission veterinarian.</p>
                  <p>(5) For any horse that has not been in a trainer's control for at least 14 days, the trainer must obtain and make available a record going back at least 14 days that complies with this subpart.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">3</inline>. <b>Jockeys and apprentice jockeys.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Jockeys and apprentice jockeys shall have the following responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>A. An apprentice jockey must ride with a five-pound weight allowance beginning with the jockey's first mount and for one full year thereafter, unless the jockey is riding in stakes races, handicap races, or substituting for a journeyman jockey who is unable to fulfill a riding engagement. If after one full year from the date of the jockey's fifth winning mount the apprentice jockey has failed to ride 40 winners, the jockey shall continue to ride with a five-pound weight allowance for up to two years from the date of the jockey's fifth winning mount or until the jockey has ridden a total of 40 winners, whichever comes first. Apprentice allowances may be waived with the stewards' permission at the time of entry by the trainer or the trainer's designee. If an apprentice jockey is unable to ride for a period of 14 consecutive days or more after the date of the jockey's fifth winning mount because of service in the United States armed forces, enrollment in an institution of secondary or postsecondary education, or because of physical disability, the commission may extend the time during which the apprentice weight allowance may be claimed for a period not to exceed the period the apprentice jockey was unable to ride.</p>
                  <p>B. For purposes of the remainder of this subpart, reference to "jockey" also includes apprentice jockey.</p>
                  <p>C. Each jockey engaged to ride in a race must be in the jockey's room at the reporting time specified by the stewards on each day he or she is scheduled to ride. Upon arrival, the jockey shall report to the clerk of scales.</p>
                  <p>D. Each jockey reporting to the jockeys' room must remain there until he or she has fulfilled all of that day's riding engagements. While in the performance of his or her duties, the jockey may have no contact or communication concerning the day's races with any person outside the jockeys' room, without the permission of the stewards, other than with an owner or trainer for whom he or she is riding that day, or with the stewards or other commission officials.</p>
                  <p>E. Each jockey engaged to ride in a race shall report his or her riding weight to the clerk of scales at the time specified by the association.</p>
                  <p>F. Each jockey engaged to ride in a race must report to the clerk of scales for weighing out not more than 30 minutes before post time for the first race, if he or she is riding in that race, nor sooner than the running of the preceding race, if he or she is riding in any other race.</p>
                  <p>G. (1)</p>
                  <p>A jockey's weight shall include clothing, boots, saddle and its attachments, and any other equipment except the bridle, bit, blinkers, goggles, number cloth, and safety equipment including helmet, vest, overgirth, reins, and breast collar.</p>
                  <p>(2) Upon the steward's approval, jockeys may be allowed up to three pounds more than published weights to account for inclement weather clothing and equipment.</p>
                  <p>H. No jockey may weigh-out if the jockey is more than two pounds over the weight assigned to the jockey's horse without permission of the owner or trainer, and under no circumstances shall the overweight exceed seven pounds.</p>
                  <p>I. If employing an agent, a jockey is bound by all commitments made by the agent. If not employing an agent, the jockey shall conduct business as if the jockey is the agent.</p>
                  <p>J. A jockey must fill all riding engagements. However, no jockey may be forced to ride a horse that the jockey believes to be unsafe, or to ride on a race course the jockey believes to be unsafe.</p>
                  <p>K. A jockey unable to fulfill riding engagements because of injury must pass a physical examination conducted by a licensed physician or paramedic before resuming race riding.</p>
                  <p>L. A jockey must wear the racing colors provided by the owner of the horse the jockey is to ride, plus solid white riding pants, top boots, and a number on the right shoulder corresponding to the mount's number as shown on the saddle cloth and in the daily program. With the approval of the stewards, the jockeys will be permitted to wear black mud pants during bad weather conditions or during muddy or sloppy track conditions.</p>
                  <p>(1) A jockey shall not wear advertising or promotional material of any kind on clothing during a race unless the material:</p>
                  <p>(a) advertises or promotes the Jockeys' Guild;</p>
                  <p>(b) advertises or promotes a racing-related 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization;</p>
                  <p>(c) contains the jockey's name; or</p>
                  <p>(d) constitutes other advertising or promotional material that does not compete with, conflict with, or infringe upon sponsorship agreements applicable to the racing association, race, or race meet in progress.</p>
                  <p>(2) All advertising or promotional material must comply with the following limits on size and location:</p>
                  <p>(a) there may be up to 32 square inches of advertising or promotional material on each thigh of the pants, which must be located on the outer side between the hip and knee;</p>

                  <p>(d) there may be up to six square inches of advertising or promotional material on the front center of the neck area, on a turtleneck, or other undergarment.</p>
                  <p>M. In any race, a jockey must ride to win or to finish as near as possible to first. A jockey shall not ease the jockey's horse without cause, even if the horse has no apparent chance to earn a portion of the purse.</p>
                  <p>N. A jockey must make the jockey's best effort to control and guide the jockey's horse in such a way so as not to endanger the jockey's own horse or other horses and jockeys, nor to cause a foul.</p>
                  <p>O. A jockey must unsaddle the jockey's own horse before weighing in.</p>
                  <p>(1) A jockey shall weigh in at no less than the same weight at which the jockey weighed out, and if under that weight, and after consideration of mitigating circumstances by the board of stewards, the jockey's mount may be disqualified from any portion of the purse money.</p>
                  <p>(2) In the event of a disqualification, all money wagered on the horse shall be refunded unless the race has been declared official.</p>
                  <p>(3) A jockey's weight shall include clothing, boots, saddle and its attachments, and any other equipment except the bridle, bit, blinkers, number cloth, overgirth, reins, and breast collar.</p>
                  <p>(4) Upon approval of the stewards, the jockeys may be allowed up to three pounds more than published weights to account for inclement weather clothing and equipment.</p>
                  <p>(5) The postrace weight of jockeys includes any sweat, dirt, and mud that have accumulated on the jockey, and the jockey's clothing, safety equipment, and overgirth. This accounts for additional weight, depending on specific equipment, as well as weather, track, and racing conditions.</p>
                  <p>P. Each jockey must check the stewards' daily video replay list in the jockeys' room and report to the stewards, at the time designated, if so required by the list.</p>
                  <p>Q. A jockey must notify the stewards in writing on a form provided by the commission if the jockey intends to sever a business relationship with an agent or if the jockey intends to change agents. The notification must be signed by both the jockey and agent.</p>
                  <p>R. A jockey not prohibited by contract may agree to give first or second call on the jockey's services to any licensed owner or trainer. Such agreements must be in writing if for a period of more than 30 days.</p>
                  <p>S. A jockey employed by a racing stable on a regular salaried basis shall not ride against the stable. No owner or trainer shall employ or engage a jockey to prevent the jockey from riding another horse.</p>
                  <p>T. Conflicting claims for the services of a jockey shall be decided by the stewards.</p>
                  <p>U. A jockey mount fee shall be considered earned by a jockey when the jockey is weighed out by the clerk of scales, except in the following cases:</p>
                  <p>(1) (a) When the jockey does not weigh out and ride in a race for which engaged because an owner or trainer engaged more than one jockey for the same race. In such a case, the owner or trainer shall pay a jockey mount fee that is equal to that earned by the jockey who rode the horse to each jockey engaged for the race.</p>
                  <p>(b) In the event an owner or trainer elects to remove a jockey from a mount after naming the jockey at the time of the draw, the stewards shall require a jockey fee to be paid to the removed jockey if that jockey is available to ride in the race. The fee to be paid to the jockey who was removed from the mount must be equal to that earned by the jockey who rode the horse.</p>
                  <p>(2) When a jockey, of the jockey's own free will, elects to be taken off a mount where injury to the horse or rider is not involved.</p>
                  <p>(3) When the stewards replace the jockey with a substitute jockey for reasons other than the jockey suffering an injury during the time between weighing out and the start of the race.</p>
                  <p>(4) Any conditions or considerations not covered by this part shall be addressed at the discretion of the stewards. All jockey protests must be filed prior to the race.</p>
                  <p>V. No jockey shall willfully or purposely touch, strike, or jostle another jockey or horse, either with hands or riding crop, from the time they leave the paddock until after dismounting from a race.</p>
                  <p>W. A jockey who is suspended for less than ten days for a riding infraction may be allowed to ride in a stakes or trial race that was designated by the stewards prior to the start of the race season. Permission to race will be granted at the stewards' discretion, based on the circumstances of the suspension. For each racing day that a jockey is permitted to ride in a stakes or trial race under this item, the stewards shall designate an additional day of suspension to be served.</p>
                  <p>X. Beginning April 1, 2021, jockeys and apprentice jockeys shall comply with the concussion protocol in place at the licensed racetrack.</p>

When the veterinarian has delegated certain animal care tasks to a veterinary assistant, the licensed veterinarian is at all times quickly and easily available to the veterinary assistant to render veterinary care consistent with the delegated animal health care task. Veterinary assistants are held to the same standard of care as the licensed veterinarian.</p>
                  <p>B. Veterinary assistants shall not:</p>

The starter shall report to the stewards any disobedience of his or her orders or attempts to take unfair advantage at the starting gate.</p>
                  <p>B. The starter shall be responsible for providing a fair and equal start of all horses in a race by means of a starting gate. Whenever a horse is prevented from obtaining a fair start, the starter shall immediately notify the stewards.</p>

                  <p>(5) The starter shall maintain a daily written record showing the names of all horses starting, the assistant starter who handled each horse, and any equipment other than a lead strap used for each horse. The record shall be kept for at least 90 days after the last day of the race meet and shall be made available to the stewards or the commission upon request.</p>
                  <p>(6) The starter shall observe anyone seeking an apprentice jockey's license breaking a horse from a starting gate in company with other horses. The starter shall report his or her observations to the stewards.</p>

                  <p>The stewards shall exercise immediate supervision, control, and regulation of racing at each licensed race meeting on behalf of the commission and shall be responsible only to the commission. The powers of the stewards shall include:</p>
                  <p>A. the authority over all horses and all persons, licensed or unlicensed, on association grounds during a race meeting as to all matters relating to racing;</p>
                  <p>B. the authority to determine all questions, disputes, protests, complaints, or objections concerning racing matters which arise during a race meeting and to enforce such determinations;</p>
                  <p>C. the authority to suspend, according to applicable law, the license of a participant in racing;</p>
                  <p>D. the authority to eject or exclude according to applicable law, from association grounds or any part thereof, licensed or unlicensed persons for violations of law;</p>
                  <p>E. the authority to interpret and enforce commission rules and determine all questions pertaining to racing matters in conformity with applicable law and rule and the criteria in subpart 3;</p>
                  <p>F. the authority to issue decisions or rulings pertaining to racing matters which shall supersede orders of the officers, directors, and officials of the association, which may vary any arrangement relating to the conduct of a race meeting, including postponing or canceling a race, or ruling a race "no contest";</p>
                  <p>G. the authority to request and receive assistance from commission employees, racing officials, track security, and federal, state, or local police in the investigation of possible violations of law;</p>
                  <p>H. the authority to conduct hearings on all questions, disputes, protests, complaints, or objections concerning racing matters;</p>
                  <p>I. in the event a jockey, driver, trainer, or racing official, other than a steward, is determined to be unable for any reason to perform his or her duties, the authority to appoint a substitute therefor;</p>
                  <p>J. the authority to scratch a horse or excuse any jockey, driver, trainer, or racing official other than a steward;</p>
                  <p>K. for all county fair meets in which the average daily handle for the preceding year was less than $150,000, the rules of horse racing and pari-mutuel rules shall apply unless waived by the commission after a determination by the commission that the integrity of the race meet and safety to humans or animals would not be affected. In the event circumstances during a race meet require an immediate change so as to expedite the completion of the race day, the board of stewards, after consultation with the director of security, commission veterinarian, or director of pari-mutuels, as determined appropriate under the circumstance, shall thereafter approve the change. In the event the board of stewards is unable to consult with the appropriate commission staff member after a reasonable time, the board of stewards shall approve the change without such consultation; and</p>
                  <p>L. for a period of 90 days after the conclusion of a race meeting at a licensed facility or a county fair meet, jurisdiction to hold hearings and take action with regard to any aspect of racing at the meet shall continue with the board of stewards or, if considered by the commission to be more practical or convenient for the parties concerned, may be exercised by a single knowledgeable person designated by the commission. Any person acting in lieu of the board of stewards under this part shall have all of the authority granted to the board of stewards under this part or any other applicable rule. A person may appeal from any action taken, in the same manner as an appeal may be taken from a steward's hearing.</p>

A Thoroughbred horse that has not started for a period of 61 days or more is not eligible to start until it has completed two timed workouts within 60 days and no less than 48 hours before the race in which it is entered. Any workout following the entry of a horse shall appear on the official daily racing program or shall be posted for the public.</p>
                  <p>B. A Quarter Horse that has not started for a period of 61 days or more is not eligible to start until it has completed one timed workout within 60 days of and no less than 48 hours before the race in which it is entered. Any workout following the entry of a horse must appear on the official or daily racing program or must be posted for the public.</p>
                  <p>C. A first-time starter less than four years of age must have gate approval and a minimum of two timed workouts, one of which must be out of the gate, no more than 60 days prior to the race in which it is entered.</p>
                  <p>D. A first-time starter four years of age or older must have gate approval and a minimum of three timed workouts, at least one of which must be out of the gate and one of which must be an official timed workout observed and approved by a commission veterinarian, no more than 30 days prior to the race for which the horse is entered.</p>

                  <p>F. Official timed workouts shall be conducted under the same medication and testing rules applicable to racing. A horse is not eligible to be entered in a race until negative results of post-workout medication testing have been returned to the commission veterinarian.</p>
                  <p>G. For all county fairs in which the average daily handle for the preceding year was less than $150,000 all workout requirements shall be waived except that in the case of a horse that has not started for a period of one year, the owner or trainer must contact the commission veterinarian prior to entry for an examination and workout as determined by the commission veterinarian.</p>
                  <p>For the purpose of items E and G, and removing a horse from the stewards' list, all workouts must be conducted under the same medication requirements as those for race days.</p>

                  <p>The stewards shall have the authority to declare that a horse is not a starter if they determine that the horse was ineligible to participate in the race or any occurrence before, or during, the running of a race calls for such action by them.</p>

                  <p>Penalties and allowances shall be determined as follows.</p>
                  <p>A. Penalties and allowances are not cumulative, unless so declared by the conditions of the race, and shall take effect at the time of starting, except that in overnight events a horse will have only the allowance to which it was entitled at the time of entry.</p>
                  <p>B. Penalties are obligatory; allowances are optional as to all or part thereof, and in overnight events must be claimed at the time of entry.</p>
                  <p>C. No horse shall receive allowance of weight nor be relieved from extra weight for having been beaten in one or more races, but this rule shall not prohibit maiden allowance or allowances to horses that have not won a race within a specified period or a race of specified value.</p>
                  <p>D. Failure to claim a weight allowance by oversight or omission is not cause for disqualification. Claims of weight allowance to which a horse is not entitled shall not disqualify unless such incorrect weight is carried in the race. However, a fine may be imposed upon the person claiming allowance to which his or her horse is not entitled.</p>
                  <p>E. Eligibility, penalties, and allowances of weight for all races will be determined from the reports, records, and statistics published by the Daily Racing Form, Equibase, or furnished by the Arabian Jockey Club (Colorado), and from information contained on Jockey Club (Lexington) foal certificates, and from certificates issued by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), and the Arabian Horse Registry of America, Inc. (AHRA). Information contained on these certificates that is not published by the Daily Racing Form, or certified by the AQHA, or certified by the Arabian Jockey Club (AJC), will not be considered. Responsibility for weight carried and eligibility still remains with the owner and trainer as provided in part 7883.0100, subpart 15.</p>
                  <p>F. No horse shall incur a weight penalty for placement from which it is disqualified, but a horse placed through the disqualification of another horse shall incur the weight penalties of that placement. No such placement shall make a horse ineligible to a race which has already been run.</p>
                  <p>G. When a race is in dispute, both the first- and second-place finishers are liable to all penalties attached to the winner of that race until the matter is decided.</p>

                  <p>In claiming races, any horse is subject to claim for its entered price by any person who is eligible to claim or by an authorized agent. The following persons are eligible to claim:</p>
                  <p>A. Any owner licensed by the commission.</p>
                  <p>B. An applicant for an owner's license who is approved by the stewards may be granted a claiming authorization. Each application for a claiming authorization must be signed by the prospective trainer who must be licensed by the commission. Under no circumstances shall the claiming authorization be issued until the commission completes a preliminary background investigation. An owner's license will not be granted until after the claiming authorization has been executed and the applicant completes the licensing process. The applicant must complete the licensing process within ten days of executing the claiming authorization. Once the applicant has been granted a claiming authorization, he or she may open an account with the horsepersons' bookkeeper.</p>

When a request is made to void any claim under item A or B, the successful claimant is responsible for all expenses incurred for the care of the claimed horse from the time the horse is transferred to the claimant until the time the horse is ordered returned to the prior owner following voidance of the claim by the stewards in accordance with this rule.</p>
                  <p>D. Voidance of a claim is not an option if, after coming under the care, custody, and control of the claimant, the horse has already run for the claimant or has died.</p>

                  <p>B. If a horse or jockey jostles another horse such that it would affect the outcome of the race, the aggressor may be disqualified, unless the jostled horse or its jockey was partly at fault, or the jostling was wholly caused by some other horse or jockey.</p>
                  <p>C. During a race no jockey shall willfully or carelessly strike or touch another jockey or another jockey's horse or equipment with the effect of interfering with that horse or jockey, nor shall a jockey strike the jockey's horse on or about the head area.</p>
                  <p>D. For willful fouling or careless riding, a jockey may be fined or suspended, or both, by the stewards according to the nature and seriousness of the offense.</p>
                  <p>E. A jockey whose horse has been disqualified or who unnecessarily caused the horse to change or shorten its stride for the purpose of losing a race may be fined or suspended.</p>

                  <p>A. A jockey shall use a riding crop in a manner consistent with using the jockey's best efforts to win.</p>
                  <p>B. A jockey must not use the riding crop indiscriminately.</p>
                  <p>C. A jockey must not strike a horse more than three consecutive times without pausing to only push on the horse giving it a chance to respond before using the riding crop again.</p>
                  <p>D. Jockeys are prohibited from striking a horse:</p>
                  <p>(1) on the head, flanks, or on any part of its body other than the shoulders or hind quarters;</p>
                  <p>(2) during the post parade except when necessary to control the horse;</p>
                  <p>(3) excessively or brutally causing welts or breaks in the skin;</p>

                  <p>(6) after the race.</p>
                  <p>E. Correct uses of the riding crop are:</p>
                  <p>(1) showing horses the riding crop before hitting them;</p>
                  <p>(2) using the riding crop in rhythm with the horse's stride; and</p>

                  <p>The stewards are vested with sole and complete power and authority to determine when a disqualification is proper, its extent, and whether it applies to any other part of an entry. Their decision is final.</p>
                  <p>A. In determining the extent of disqualification of a horse in any race, the stewards may either place the disqualified horse behind such horse as in their judgment the disqualified horse interfered with, or they may place it last.</p>
                  <p>B. When a horse of one ownership or interest is coupled with a horse or horses of the same or another ownership or interest, the disqualification of one will not necessarily affect the placing of the other.</p>
                  <p>C. When two horses with a common ownership interest or common trainer are racing uncoupled and one is disqualified, the stewards shall also disqualify any other commonly owned or trained horse if they determine it is in the interest of racing integrity to do so. D. In the event of a disqualification, the stewards, at the request of the owner of the disqualified horse, shall review the race with that owner within 72 hours of the race.</p>

                <p>The entering and drawing of horses at Class D licensed facilities shall be governed by the following:</p>
                <p>A. Each Class D licensee must provide a locked entry box with an aperture through which all entries shall be deposited.</p>
                <p>B. At the time specified by the licensee, the chief steward, or an official designated by the chief steward, shall unlock the entry box, sort the entries contained in it, and immediately draw the post positions in the presence of owners or an owner's representative as may be present.</p>
                <p>C. At all Class D race meets the entry box shall be opened by the chief steward, or an official designated by the chief steward, at the advertised time. The chief steward or official conducting the draw will be responsible to assure that at least one owner or an official representative of the owner is present. No owner or agent for a horse with an entry in the entry box shall be denied the privilege of being present. Under the supervision of the chief steward, or an official designated by the chief steward, all entries shall be listed, the eligibility verified, preference ascertained, starters selected, and post positions drawn. If it is necessary to reopen any race as determined by the chief steward, a public announcement indicating such shall be made no fewer than two times and the entry box reopened at a specific time.</p>
                <p>D. Drawing of post positions for the second heat in races of more than one dash or heat at pari-mutuel meetings, may be conducted by the stewards from the stand for succeeding dashes or heats.</p>
                <p>E. Entries by mail, telephone, or facsimile actually received and evidence of which is deposited in the entry box before the time specified to enter, shall be drawn in the same manner as the others. Such drawings shall be final. Mail, telephone, or facsimile entries must state the name, age, color, sex, sire, and dam of the horse; the name of the driver and driver's colors; the date and place of last start; a current summary, including the number of starts, firsts, seconds, thirds, earnings, and best winning time for current year; and the event in which the horse is to be entered. It shall state any relevant medication information. It shall be the responsibility of the racing secretary to assure that such entries are signed by the person receiving same.</p>
                <p>F. When a Class D licensee requires a horse to be entered at a stated time, failure to enter as required shall be considered a withdrawal from the event.</p>
                <p>G. After entries have been made, no horse shall be withdrawn from the race except by permission of the stewards. A fine and/or a suspension shall be imposed for drawing a horse without permission and the penalty shall apply to both the horse and the party who violated this item.</p>
                <p>H. Drawings shall be final unless there is conclusive evidence that a horse properly entered was omitted from the race through the error of a track or its agent or employee in which event the horse shall be added to the race but given the last post position, provided the error is discovered prior to either scratch time or the printing of the program; however, in the case of early closers of more than $10,000 and stake and futurity races, the race shall be redrawn. This shall not apply at commercial pari-mutuel meetings in overnight events.</p>
                <p>I. Entries shall state who shall drive the horse and give the driver's colors. Drivers may be changed until the time prescribed by the stewards, of the day preceding the race, after which no driver may be changed without permission of the stewards and for good cause. When a nominator starts two or more horses, the stewards shall approve or disapprove the second or third driver.</p>
                <p>J. Entries shall state when a horse is to be raced with furosemide and, if it is the first time the horse is to race with furosemide, that information is to be included on the entry.</p>

                  <p>A. The preference date on a horse that has drawn to race and has been scratched is the date of the race from which scratched.</p>
                  <p>B. When a horse is racing for the first time in the current year, the date of the first declaration into a purse race shall be considered its preference race.</p>

                <p>Horses may qualify under part 7869.0100, subpart 51, item C, "conditioned race," if they have a current race line not to exceed 60 days before entry. Entries for overnight events shall be governed by the following:</p>
                <p>A. Within two weeks of being entered, a horse that has not raced previously at the gait chosen must compete in a qualifying race under the supervision of a judge and acquire at least one charted line by a licensed charter. In order to provide complete and accurate chart information on time and beaten lengths, a standard photo finish shall be used.</p>
                <p>B. A horse that does not show a charted line for the previous season, or a charted line within its last six starts must compete in a qualifying race as set forth in item A. Uncharted races contested in heats or more than one dash and consolidated according to item D will be considered one start.</p>
                <p>C. A horse that has not started at a charted meeting by August first of a season must compete in a qualifying race as set forth in item A.</p>
                <p>D. When a horse has raced at a charted meeting during the current season and subsequently started at meetings where the races are not charted, the information from the uncharted races may be summarized including each start, and consolidated in favor of charted lines. The requirements of item B would then not apply.</p>
                <p>E. The consolidated line shall carry date, place, time, driver, finish, track condition, and distance if the race is not at one mile.</p>
                <p>F. The judges may require any horse that has been on the stewards' list to compete in a qualifying race. If a horse has raced in individual time not meeting the qualifying standards for that class of horses, the horse may be required to compete in a qualifying race. During a season, after starting, if a horse has not started in the last 30 days, the horse must compete in a qualifying race as set forth in item A.</p>
                <p>G. The judges may permit a fast-class horse to qualify by means of a timed workout consistent with the time of the races in which the horse will compete in the event adequate competition is not available for a qualifying race. These shall be limited to free-for-all preferred or invitational class horses as defined by the rules of the USTA.</p>
                <p>H. To enable a horse to qualify, qualifying races should be held at least one full week prior to the opening of any meeting that opens before the first of July of a season and shall be scheduled at least once a week. Qualifying races shall also be scheduled once a week during the meeting.</p>
                <p>I. Where a race is conducted for the purpose of qualifying drivers and not horses, the race need not be charted, timed, or recorded. This item is not applicable to races qualifying both drivers and horses.</p>
                <p>If a horse takes a win race record in a qualifying race, the record must be prefaced with the letter "Q" wherever it appears, except in a case where, immediately prior to or following the race, the horse taking the record has been given an approved urine or blood test. It will be the responsibility of the presiding judge to report the test on the judges' sheet.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>7884.<inline name="num">0210</inline> <b>CLAIMING RACES.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>A. Claiming shall be conducted according to Rule 11 from the current United States Trotting Association (USTA) Charter, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, but any conflict between the USTA Rule 11 and this chapter will be controlled by this chapter.</p>
                <p>B. For claiming prices for harness race horses in standardbred racing, the following allowances shall be applicable with respect to claiming price:</p>
                <p>(1) for mares racing against colts or geldings, add 20 percent;</p>
                <p>(2) for two-year-olds racing against older horses, add 100 percent;</p>
                <p>(3) for three-year-olds racing against older horses, add 50 percent;</p>
                <p>(4) for four-year-olds racing against older horses, add 25 percent; and</p>
                <p>(5) spayed mares shall not receive any sex allowance.</p>
                <p>C. No claimed horse shall race at any other racetrack until after the close of the race meeting at which it was claimed, or for 60 days, whichever is shorter, except to fulfill one or more stakes engagements or to race at a county fair meet.</p>
                <p>D. The stewards shall void a claim if:</p>
                <p>(1) the horse dies or is euthanized within one hour of racing; or</p>
                <p>(2) the horse is placed on the veterinarian's list for exhibiting clinical signs of any of the following within one hour of racing: a musculoskeletal injury, lameness, or unsoundness of heart or lung. However, the claim shall not be voided for this reason if the claimant elected to claim the horse regardless of whether the horse is placed on the veterinarian's list. An election made under this part shall be made on the claim form. For purposes of this subpart, "unsoundness of heart" means atrial fibrillation or cardiac arrhythmias, and "unsoundness of lung" means recurrent airway obstructive pulmonary disease or bleeding from one or both nostrils.</p>
                <p>E. If a horse is scratched from a claiming race or declared a nonstarter, any claim on the horse is void. In that case, the horse's next start in the following 30 days must be in a race in which it can be claimed for the same price or less.</p>
                <p>F. Postrace testing on all claimed horses shall be performed as set forth in chapter 7892. Upon receipt of notification from the commission veterinarian that the initial forensic analysis demonstrates a medication violation under chapter 7890, the stewards shall immediately notify the successful claimant, who shall then have 72 hours to decide whether to keep the horse or request that the claim be voided. In that case, the following provisions shall apply.</p>
                <p>(1) When a claim is voided after the claimant has taken possession of the horse, the claimant is responsible for all expenses incurred for the care of the horse from the time the horse was transferred to the claimant until the time the horse is returned to the prior owner following voidance of the claim by the stewards.</p>
                <p>(2) Voidance of a claim is not permitted if, after coming under the care, custody, and control of the claimant, the horse has already run for the claimant or has died.</p>

                  <p>In the event the homestretch is expanded pursuant to subpart 1, the following apply.</p>
                  <p>A. When entering or while going through the homestretch for the first time in a race, no horse shall use the expanded inside lane in an attempt to pass other horses or improve its position. A horse that does so shall be disqualified and placed at the discretion of the stewards, whose decision shall be final.</p>
                  <p>B. The lead horse in the homestretch shall maintain its position giving the trailing horses full access to the expanded inside lane. If, in the opinion of the stewards, the lead horse changes course in the homestretch in an attempt to prevent a trailing horse from passing, the horse shall be placed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>C. Horses using the expanded inside lane, during the homestretch drive for the finish of the race must first have complete clearance of the pylons marking the inside boundary of the race course. A horse or sulky going inside one or more pylons, while attempting to use the expanded inside lane, may be disqualified and placed at the discretion of the stewards, whose decision shall be final.</p>
                  <p>D. During the final one-eighth mile of a race, a horse may only be driven into the expanded homestretch lane for the purpose of passing another horse and shall not be driven into the expanded homestretch lane for the purpose of blocking a trailing horse. It shall be presumed that a horse driven into the expanded homestretch lane which blocks a trailing horse, without advancing on the horse it was allegedly attempting to pass, was being driven for the purpose of blocking a trailing horse. If, in the opinion of a majority of the stewards, a horse is driven into the expanded homestretch lane for the purpose of blocking a trailing horse, the driver of the blocking horse may be fined or suspended, or both, and the horse may be placed accordingly.</p>

                  <p>"Medication" is a substance, compound, or element, or combination thereof, which is or can be administered to a horse for the purpose of preventing, curing, or alleviating the effects of any disease, condition, ailment, or infirmity, or symptom thereof, or for altering in any way the behavior, attitude, temperament, or performance of a horse, including athletic performance. Medication includes all alkalinizing agents, analgesics, anesthetics, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, tranquilizers, and other classifications of medications. Nothing herein shall be deemed to include:</p>
                  <p>A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):</p>
                  <p>(1) The use of one of the following three approved NSAIDs shall be permitted under the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>(a) phenylbutazone, provided that the test sample does not contain more than 0.3 micrograms of the substance thereof per milliliter of blood plasma or serum; or</p>
                  <p>(b) flunixin, provided that the test sample does not contain more than five nanograms of the substance thereof per milliliter of blood plasma or serum; or</p>
                  <p>(c) ketoprofen, provided that the test sample does not contain more than two nanograms of the substance thereof per milliliter of blood plasma or serum.</p>
                  <p>(2) No NSAIDs can be administered within the 48 hours before post time for the race in which the horse is entered. The use of all but one of the approved NSAIDs shall be discontinued at least 48 hours before the post time for the race in which the horse is entered.</p>
                  <p>(3) The presence of more than one NSAID in the post-race test sample, or sample taken after an official timed workout, is not permitted and shall constitute a Class B violation under the Association of Racing Commissioners International Uniform Classification Guidelines for Foreign Substances and Recommended Penalties.</p>
                  <p>(4) Any horse to which an NSAID has been administered shall be subject to having a blood and/or urine sample taken at the direction of the official veterinarian to determine the quantitative NSAID levels and/or the presence of other drugs which may be present in the blood or urine sample.</p>
                  <p>B. Furosemide, provided, however, that it is administered pursuant to the provisions of part 7890.0140, subpart 7a. The concentration of furosemide must not exceed 100 nanograms per milliliter of serum or plasma in the post-race blood sample.</p>
                  <p>C. Topical applications, such as antiseptics, ointments, salves, leg rubs, and leg paints which may contain antibiotics (excluding procaine penicillin and chloramphenicol) but which shall not contain ethanol, DMSO, corticosteroids, topical anesthetics including benzocaine and lidocaine, or other medications.</p>
                  <p>D. Vitamins and electrolytes, provided the vitamins and electrolytes are administered orally and do not contain any medications, sodium bicarbonate, or other alkalinizing agents.</p>
                  <p>E. Electrolytes except those containing sodium bicarbonate or other alkalinizing agents.</p>

For the first observed bleeding, the horse shall be placed on the bleeder list and the veterinarian's list and shall not be removed from the veterinarian's list without the approval of the commission veterinarian. Such a horse shall be ineligible to race for at least 14 days following the observed bleeding.</p>
                  <p>B. When a horse has been observed bleeding for the second time within a 365-day period, the horse shall be placed on the veterinarian's list and shall not be removed from the list without the approval of the commission veterinarian. Such a horse shall be ineligible to race for at least 30 days following the observed bleeding.</p>
                  <p>C. When a horse has been observed bleeding for the third time within a 365-day period, the horse shall be placed on the veterinarian's list and shall not be removed from the list for at least 180 days, and not until the commission veterinarian has approved its removal.</p>
                  <p>D. When a horse has been observed bleeding for a fourth time within a 365-day period, the horse shall be placed on the veterinarian's list and will be permanently ineligible to race in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>E. Following a bleeding episode in another jurisdiction, a horse shall not be eligible to race in Minnesota for at least 14 days or for a longer period if deemed medically necessary in the professional opinion of the commission veterinarian after considering the horse's past bleeding history.</p>
                  <p>F. For the purposes of counting the number of days a horse is ineligible to run, the day the horse bled externally is the first day of the recovery period.</p>
                  <p>G. The voluntary administration of furosemide without an external bleeding incident shall not subject a horse to the initial period of ineligibility as defined by this subpart.</p>

If the use of furosemide is discontinued, the horse shall be prohibited from again racing with furosemide unless it is later observed to be bleeding pursuant to subpart 1 or the horse is claimed or transferred to a different licensed trainer. A horse that is claimed or transferred to a different licensed trainer is eligible to race with furosemide if the new trainer and a licensed veterinarian employed by the new owner or trainer determine that it would be in the horse's best interest to race with furosemide. Requests for the use of or discontinuance of furosemide must be made to the commission veterinarian by the horse's current trainer or assistant trainer on a form prescribed by the commission on or before the day of entry into the race for which the request is made.</p>

Horses to be tested may be selected at random or as otherwise reasonably determined by the stewards or commission veterinarian. A positive test shall result in the horse being placed on the commission veterinarian's list under part 7877.0175, subpart 8.</p>
                  <p>C. Out-of-competition testing for prohibited substances, blood doping agents, gene doping agents, growth hormone, exogenous anabolic steroids, and clenbuterol may be performed at the request and under the direction of the stewards or the commission veterinarian on any horse nominated for stakes or specific racing series. Horses to be tested may be selected at random or as otherwise reasonably determined by the stewards or commission veterinarian. Split samples shall be collected in accordance with subpart 5. A positive test shall result in the horse being placed on the commission veterinarian's list under part 7877.0175, subpart 8.</p>
                  <p>D. The stewards or commission veterinarian may require that specimens of hair, saliva, or other body fluid or excretion may be taken from a tested horse as deemed necessary by the stewards or the commission veterinarian to determine whether a violation of chapter 7890 has occurred.</p>
                  <p>E. A hair sample collected any time after a horse is entered to race at a licensed racetrack shall be deemed a post-race sample for purposes of parts 7869.0200 and 7890.0110.</p>
                  <p>F. Any owner, trainer, or other person having care, custody, or control of a horse required to be tested must submit the horse immediately.</p>

                  <p>A. A portion of the sample from each horse tested, after a sufficient amount has been sent to the official laboratory, must be preserved by the commission. It must be available for testing at the request of a person accused of a violation of chapter 7890. In the absence of urine or blood (serum or plasma) for split sample testing, urine or blood (serum or plasma) from the original testing laboratory, if available, may be sent to the designated split sample laboratory for analysis. The commission shall approve a list of laboratories that are capable of providing split sample testing. From this list, a person accused of a violation of chapter 7890 shall designate the laboratories in descending order of preference. The sample must be sent to the laboratory given the highest preference and that is capable of testing and submitting results for the substance within 14 days of sample receipt. The commission veterinarian shall have overall responsibility for the storage, safeguarding, and shipment of the split sample and for the receipt of results from the drug testing laboratory to which the sample was sent.</p>
                  <p>B. A person making a request for split sample testing must notify the stewards in writing within 72 hours of receiving notice of the commission laboratory's findings and a list of approved split sample laboratories.</p>
                  <p>C. A person making a request for split sample testing must provide the request in writing on a form prescribed by the commission to the commission veterinarian within 24 hours of notification to the stewards of the intent to submit a split sample.</p>
                  <p>D. The trainer is responsible for the cost of split sample testing and fees for shipping and handling of the sample. Payment for split sample testing must accompany the sample or be made in advance directly to the split sample laboratory. Shipping and handling fees are payable to the Minnesota Racing Commission within seven days of shipment.</p>
                  <p>E. Failure to comply with the provisions of items B and C shall render the request for split sample testing null and void.</p>

                  <p>A. Prior to foaling, a broodmare must be in Minnesota and registered or the registration renewed with the Racing Commission or official registering agency on or before March 15 of the year in which the broodmare will foal and must remain in Minnesota until foaling. The broodmare's original jockey club certificate must be received by the Racing Commission or official registering agency.</p>
                  <p>B. In the event an unregistered broodmare should foal in Minnesota before March 15, the owner must submit a sworn affidavit to the Racing Commission or the official registering agency attesting that the foal was born in Minnesota. The affidavit will be considered evidence that the foal is a Minnesota-bred or Minnesota-foaled horse and the owner of the broodmare or his or her agent must register the broodmare in accordance with item A. The attending veterinarian, licensed by the state of Minnesota, must certify on information and belief that the information provided from the owner or agent is true and correct.</p>
                  <p>C. Late fees for late broodmare registration will be imposed as follows:</p>

                  <p>D. Failure to submit broodmare registration forms on or before June 13 of the foaling year (excluding Saturday and Sunday) will require a late fee of $300 to qualify for any subsequent claims for breeders' award payments or for the foal to be registered as Minnesota-bred.</p>
                  <p>E. The commission may, at its discretion, request written documentation from any persons seeking late registration that the broodmare was standing in Minnesota as of March 15 of the foaling year.</p>

                  <p>B. Stallions must remain in Minnesota for the entire breeding season from January 31 to July 31.</p>
                  <p>A newly acquired stallion which has not been in Minnesota for breeding purposes before January 31 of the current breeding season may be eligible for stallion awards if the stallion has been properly registered with the commission prior to servicing any mare and the stallion has not serviced any mare after December 31 of the preceding year.</p>
                  <p>C. Late fees for late stallion registration will be imposed as follows:</p>

                  <p>(1) A late fee of $50 will be imposed for foal registrations received up to 30 days late (excluding Saturday and Sunday).</p>

                  <p>C. Failure to submit foal registration forms on or before 120 days of the date of foaling will require a late fee of $300 to qualify for any subsequent claims to enter the horse in a restricted race or to earn any breeders' fund payments.</p>
                  <p>D. The original foal certificate must be embossed by the Racing Commission or official registering agency prior to entry into any restricted race.</p>

                  <p>To be eligible to participate in the standardbred breeders' fund program, the following requirements must be met:</p>
                  <p>A. Stallions must be in Minnesota and registered or the registration renewed with the Racing Commission or official registering agency by January 31 of the current breeding year. The stallion's original United States Trotting Association (USTA) certificate must be received by the Racing Commission or official registering agency. If the stallion is leased, a copy of the lease must accompany the registration application or renewal. The lease agreement must contain a statement that the lessee is authorized to sign the breeding certificate.</p>
                  <p>B. Stallions must remain in Minnesota for the entire breeding season from January 31 to July 31 unless:</p>
                  <p>(1) the commission is notified in writing by certified mail; and</p>
                  <p>(2) the stallion is leaving Minnesota for racing purposes, medical purposes, show purposes, or is sold through public auction or sold privately.</p>
                  <p>A stallion may not breed any mares while outside Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>A newly acquired stallion which has not been in Minnesota for breeding purposes before January 31 of the current breeding season may be eligible for stallion awards if the stallion has been properly registered with the commission prior to servicing any mare and the stallion has not serviced any mare after December 31 of the preceding year.</p>
                  <p>C. Late fees for late stallion registration will be imposed as follows:</p>
                  <p>(1) A late fee of $50 will be imposed for stallion registrations received February 1 to March 1 (excluding Saturday and Sunday) of the breeding year.</p>
                  <p>(2) A late fee of $100 will be imposed for stallion registrations received March 2 to May 1 (excluding Saturday and Sunday) of the breeding year.</p>
                  <p>D. Failure to submit stallion registration forms on or before May 1 of the breeding year (excluding Saturday and Sunday) will require a late fee of $300 to qualify for any subsequent claims for stallion award payments.</p>
                  <p>E. The commission may, at its discretion, request written documentation from any persons seeking late registration that the stallion was standing in Minnesota as of January 31 of the breeding year.</p>

                  <p>B. Failure to have the foal registered with the Racing Commission by December 31 of the year of its birth will require a late fee to qualify for any subsequent claims to enter the horse in a restricted race or to earn any breeders' fund payments.</p>
                  <p>C. Late fees for foal registration will be imposed as follows:</p>

                  <p>For purposes of this part, the following terms have the meanings given them unless another intention clearly appears:</p>
                  <p>A. "Artificial insemination" means the introduction of semen, either fresh, cooled, or frozen, into the vagina or uterus of the mare without sexual contact.</p>
                  <p>B. "Breeder" means the owner or lessee of the dam at the time of conception.</p>
                  <p>C. "Broodmare" means either a recipient mare, or a mare in foal by natural cover or artificial insemination.</p>
                  <p>D. "Donor mare" means the genetic dam of the embryo, oocyte, or fertilized egg, but not the mare carrying the foal.</p>

                  <p>H. "Minnesota-bred" shall be defined in three different and distinct categories:</p>
                  <p>(1) "Minnesota-bred sired and foaled" means a horse that is:</p>
                  <p>(a) sired by a registered Minnesota-sire who stood his entire breeding season in Minnesota; and</p>
                  <p>(b) Minnesota-foaled.</p>
                  <p>(2) "Minnesota-bred foaled" means a Minnesota-foaled horse.</p>

                  <p>K. "Minnesota-sired" means a horse sired by a registered Minnesota-sire and registered with the commission. Horses can be sired by natural cover, artificial insemination, or by transfer of an embryo, oocyte, or fertilized egg.</p>
                  <p>L. "Natural cover" means natural breeding occurring between a mare and stallion.</p>
                  <p>M. "Recipient mare" means a mare carrying a foal by means of transfer of an embryo, oocyte, or fertilized egg from a donor mare. The recipient mare must be identified on a copy of the donor mare's original papers as required by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) and registered with the Racing Commission.</p>
                  <p>N. "Oocyte" means an egg or female reproductive cells.</p>
                  <p>O. "Oocyte transfer" means the transfer of a retrieved, unfertilized egg(s) from a donor mare into a recipient mare and then the mare is bred.</p>

                  <p>The amount of money distributed by the commission for awards or purse supplements pursuant to subpart 3, other than the matching purse supplement awards described in subpart 3, shall be paid out for stakes or handicap races in the same percentage as the purse money in the race and shall be paid out in open overnight races and restricted overnight races to Minnesota-bred horses that finish fifth or better. However, the commission may, prior to the beginning of each race meet, establish the maximum amount of earnings per race for a single horse that may be used in calculation of the breeders' fund awards. (For example: if the maximum amount of earnings per race per horse is set at $10,000, then in the event a horse earns any amount over $10,000 in one race, the breeders' fund awards will be calculated based on $10,000 earnings for that race.) The amount of money to be distributed shall be in accordance with subpart 5. Purse supplements earned shall not be included in determining breeders' or stallion awards.</p>

                  <p>To be eligible to receive any award payments and to make a mare's foal eligible for restricted races, the following requirements must be met:</p>
                  <p>A. Prior to foaling, a broodmare must be in Minnesota and registered or the registration renewed with the Racing Commission or official registering agency on or before January 31 of the year in which the broodmare will foal and must remain in Minnesota until foaling. The broodmare's original American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) certificate (or Jockey Club certificate in the case of a Thoroughbred mare in foal to a Minnesota-sire registered in the Permanent Registry of the American Quarter Horse Association) must be received by the Racing Commission or official registering agency. The broodmare must be in foal to a Minnesota registered stallion which means a stallion owned at least 50 percent by residents of Minnesota or leased entirely by Minnesota residents, and which has stood the entire breeding season from January 31 to July 31 in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>B. In the event a broodmare that is not registered with the Racing Commission should foal in Minnesota before January 31, the owner or lessee must submit a sworn affidavit to the Racing Commission or the official registering agency attesting that the foal was sired and born in Minnesota. The affidavit will be considered evidence that the foal is a Minnesota-bred sired and foaled horse and the owner of the broodmare or his or her agent must register the broodmare in accordance with item A. The attending veterinarian, licensed by the state of Minnesota, must certify on information and belief that the information provided by the owner, lessee, or agent is true and correct.</p>
                  <p>C. In the event that a broodmare is in foal to a Minnesota-bred sire by means of artificial insemination or transfer of an embryo, oocyte, or fertilized egg the broodmare must be in Minnesota prior to foaling. The recipient mare must be identified on the registration form of the donor mare that is submitted to the Racing Commission on or before January 31 of the year in which the recipient mare will foal. If there are multiple foals from each mare/stallion combination, only one of these foals from each breeding season may be registered as Minnesota-bred. The breeder retains the right to decide which foal is Minnesota-bred if this event occurs. The registration must be made according to subpart 3 or 4.</p>

                  <p>A newly acquired stallion which has not been in Minnesota for breeding purposes before January 31 of the current breeding season may be eligible for stallion awards if the stallion has not serviced any mare after December 31 of the previous year.</p>

                  <p>The commission, the commission's director of security, or the stewards may, at any time, require any licensee having direct physical contact with horses or direct responsibility for some portion of the day's racing program, or whose racing duties place him or her in a position of danger, or who commits an act that endangers a horse or human, to provide one of the following for analysis: blood, breath, saliva, or urine samples. The type or types of sample to be provided shall be determined by the board of stewards after consideration of the circumstances involved and the alleged substance involved. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be a serious violation under part 7897.0130.</p>

For purposes of this part, "alcohol concentration" means:</p>
                  <p>A. the number of grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood; or</p>
                  <p>B. the number of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath; or</p>
                  <p>C. the number of grams of alcohol per 67 milliliters of urine.</p>

                  <p>Whenever the stewards have reasonable cause to believe that a Class C licensee has committed an act or engaged in conduct in violation of statute or rules of the commission or which in the opinion of the stewards otherwise adversely affects the integrity of horse racing, the following procedures will apply:</p>
                  <p>A. The licensee shall be immediately subject to such intermediate conditions, limitations, and restrictions as the stewards decide necessary to protect the public safety, health, and welfare and to ensure the integrity of racing.</p>
                  <p>B. Within three days of the matter coming to the attention of the stewards, the licensee shall be summoned to a meeting of the stewards called for the purpose of investigating suspected or alleged misconduct by the licensee at which all stewards or their appointed deputies shall be present; however, the licensee may request a continuance and such continuance need not necessarily stay any intermediate sanction.</p>
                  <p>C. The summons given to the licensee shall be in writing and give adequate notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the stewards' meeting, and shall specify by number the statutes or rules allegedly violated.</p>
                  <p>D. Every person called to testify before the stewards at such meeting is entitled to have counsel or an observer of the person's choosing present at the meeting; however, such counsel or observer may only participate under such conditions or in such manner as the stewards direct.</p>
                  <p>E. If a licensee, after receiving adequate notice of a stewards' meeting, fails to appear as summoned, the licensee will be deemed to have waived any right to appear and present evidence to the stewards.</p>
                  <p>F. No special announcement of the meeting or of the alleged infraction of rules shall be made until after the stewards' meeting, when the stewards shall transmit a signed written decision to the commission and to the licensee containing the stewards' findings and the penalty imposed.</p>
                  <p>G. In the event the stewards are unable to arrive at a decision by a majority vote, the matter will automatically be referred to the commission and treated as an appeal.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">10</inline>. <b>Penalties imposed by stewards or commission for medication violations.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. Upon a finding of a violation of chapter 7890, the stewards or commission shall consider the classification and penalty category of the substance at the time of the violation as referenced in the Association of Racing Commissioners International Uniform Classification Guidelines for Foreign Substances and Recommended Penalties, as well as any existing mitigating or aggravating factors, and shall impose penalties and disciplinary measures consistent with the recommendations contained therein except as limited by part 7897.0130, subpart 5.</p>
                  <p>B. Mitigating or aggravating factors must be shown by a preponderance of evidence that the circumstances were actually present in the instant case. Mere speculation that the circumstances might have been present is not sufficient proof.</p>
                  <p>C. For purposes of this subpart, mitigating factors are conditions or circumstances that do not excuse or justify wrongful conduct, but are considered out of fairness in deciding to reduce a penalty.</p>
                  <p>D. For purposes of this subpart, aggravating factors are conditions or circumstances that permit a harsher penalty to be imposed but do not permit a penalty to be imposed greater than that allowed under the law or rule.</p>
