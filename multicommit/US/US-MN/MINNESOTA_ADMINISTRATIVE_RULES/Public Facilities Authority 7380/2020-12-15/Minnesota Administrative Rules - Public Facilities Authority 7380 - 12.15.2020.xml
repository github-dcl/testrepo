                  <p>B. Borrowers with a project service area population under 2,500 must receive additional discounts on loan amounts up to $20,000 per household as provided in subitems (1) and (2).</p>

If the average residential system cost per household, as a percentage of median household income of the borrower, is greater than:</p>
                  <p>(a) 2.00 percent, the borrower must receive a discount of 150 basis points;</p>

If there is reason to believe that the United States Census data or the data from the state demographer is not a current, accurate representation of the median household income or population of the project's service area, the borrower may document the reasons why the data is not an accurate representation, and obtain additional information regarding median household income or population of the project's service area. The information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, state, or federal sources, or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source. If the authority determines that the demographic data submitted by the borrower does not reflect the most current or accurate measure of the population and median household income of the project's service area, the authority shall update the demographic data to reflect the most current and accurate figures.</p>

                  <p>A. In general, the rate of interest on a loan must be based on the principal redemption schedule of the loan, the appropriate bond yield scale identified in subpart 2, and the applicable interest rate discounts identified in subpart 3.</p>
                  <p>B. The interest rate on a loan must be set based on the date that the authority receives from the applicant a formal request to proceed with the loan agreement. This must be after the authority has received all of the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) a complete application;</p>
                  <p>(2) project certification by the Pollution Control Agency; and</p>
                  <p>(3) documentation of as-bid costs.</p>
                  <p>C. In no case may the interest rate on a loan be less than one percent.</p>
                  <p>D. For loans funded in whole or in part with proceeds of authority bonds, the rate of interest on those loans must not exceed a rate which results in the yield on the loan being materially higher than the yield on the bonds as required and defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and interpretations of the United States Department of Treasury promulgated with respect thereto, including and without limitation Code of Federal Regulations, title 26, section 1.148(2)(d).</p>

                  <p>A. For loans secured with a tax-exempt general obligation bond, the rate must be based on the greater of the Aaa market scale or the unadjusted authority scale.</p>

The information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, state, or federal sources, or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source. If the authority determines that the demographic data submitted by the borrower does not reflect the most current or accurate measure of the population and median household income of the project's service area, the authority shall update the demographic data to reflect the most current and accurate figures.</p>
