                  <p>B. any individual person (other than an individual deemed a nonresident under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, United States Code, title 50 appendix, section 574, or an individual eligible for reciprocity under Minnesota Statutes, section 290.081) who is not domiciled in Minnesota but who maintains a place of abode in Minnesota and spends in the aggregate more than one-half of the taxable year in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>A person may be a resident of Minnesota for income tax purposes, and taxable as a resident, even though the person is not deemed a resident for other purposes.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">2</inline>. <b>Domicile; definition and presumptions.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The term "domicile" means the bodily presence of an individual person in a place coupled with an intent to make such a place one's home. The domicile of any person is that place in which that person's habitation is fixed, without any present intentions of removal therefrom, and to which, whenever absent, that person intends to return.</p>
                  <p>A person who leaves home to go into another jurisdiction for temporary purposes only is not considered to have lost that person's domicile. But if a person moves to another jurisdiction with the intention of remaining there permanently or for an indefinite time as a home, that person has lost that person's domicile in this state. The presumption is that a person who leaves this state to accept a job assignment in a foreign nation has not lost that person's domicile in this state.</p>
                  <p>Except for a person covered by the provisions of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, United States Code, title 50 appendix, section 574, the presumption is that the place where a person's family is domiciled is that person's domicile. The domicile of a spouse is the same as the other spouse unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary or unless the husband and wife are legally separated or the marriage has been dissolved. When a person has made a home at any place with the intention of remaining there and the person's family neither lives there nor intends to do so, then that person has established a domicile separate from that person's family.</p>
                  <p>The domicile of a single person is that person's usual home. In a case of a minor child who is not emancipated, the domicile of the child's parents is the domicile of the child. The domicile of the parent who has legal custody of the child is the domicile of the child. A person who is a permanent resident alien in the United States may have a domicile in this state. The domicile of a member of the armed forces will be governed by the facts just prior to becoming a member of the armed forces unless the person takes the necessary steps to establish a new domicile.</p>
                  <p>The mere intention to acquire a new domicile, without the fact of physical removal, does not change the status of the taxpayer, nor does the fact of physical removal, without the intention to remain, change the person's status. The presumption is that one's domicile is the place where one lives. An individual can have only one domicile at any particular time. A domicile once shown to exist is presumed to continue until the contrary is shown. An absence of intention to abandon a domicile is equivalent to an intention to retain the existing one. No positive rule can be adopted with respect to the evidence necessary to prove an intention to change a domicile but such intention may be proved by acts and declarations, and of the two forms of evidence, acts must be given more weight than declarations. A person who is temporarily employed within this state does not acquire a domicile in this state if during that period the person is domiciled outside of this state.</p>

                  <p>R. location of other transactions with financial institutions;</p>
                  <p>S. location of the place of worship at which the person is a member;</p>

T is scheduled to arrive in Minnesota at 7:00 P.M. on March 1, and is scheduled to depart at 1:00 P.M. on March 2. Since T is in transit between two points outside Minnesota and is present instate less than 24 hours, neither March 1 nor March 2 is treated as a day within Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>B. T has been in Minnesota from March 1 to April 15. On April 15, T departed from Minnesota at 6:00 A.M. T is treated as present in Minnesota on April 15.</p>

                  <p>An abode is a dwelling place permanently maintained by a person, whether or not owned and whether or not occupied by the person. It does not need to be permanent in the sense that the person does not intend to abandon it at some future time. However, a cabin or cottage not suitable for year round use and used only for vacations is not an abode. Additionally, quarters which contain sleeping arrangements but do not contain facilities for cooking or bathing will not generally be considered an abode.</p>
                  <p>A person who moves a domicile outside Minnesota is not considered to be maintaining an abode in Minnesota even though the person continues to own or rent a dwelling in Minnesota if the person has moved personal furnishings and belongings from the dwelling and is making a good faith effort to sell, lease, or sublease the dwelling.</p>

                  <p>A. T was domiciled in Minnesota from January 1, 1987, through September 1, 1987, and did not leave the state during that period. On September 2, 1987, T sold the Minnesota dwelling and changed domicile to Texas.</p>
                  <p>T was a part year resident of Minnesota in 1987. Although T was physically present in Minnesota over 183 days, the physical presence test does not apply because T did not maintain an abode in Minnesota during the part of the year T was not domiciled in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>B. Same facts as item A, but T decided not to sell the Minnesota abode.</p>
                  <p>T was a full year resident of Minnesota in 1987. T was physically present in Minnesota over one-half of the year and maintained an abode in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>C. Same facts as item A, but T did not sell the Minnesota dwelling although T listed it for sale with a real estate broker at fair market value from September 1 through December 31, 1987.</p>
                  <p>T was a part year resident of Minnesota in 1987, assuming T removed personal belongings and furnishings from the Minnesota abode when T changed domicile. Although T was physically present over one-half of the year and continued to own a dwelling in Minnesota, T will not be considered to have maintained an abode in Minnesota because T moved belongings from the dwelling and made a good faith effort to sell the dwelling.</p>
                  <p>D. T moved from Minnesota to Florida on February 1, 1987. T maintained an abode in Minnesota and lived in that abode May 1, 1987 to September 1, 1987.</p>
                  <p>T was not a full year resident of Minnesota under the physical presence test. Although T maintained a Minnesota abode, T was not physically present in Minnesota over one-half of the year.</p>
                  <p>However, the department could review the steps T took to change domicile and could consider T a full year resident if it were determined T remained domiciled in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>E. T moved domicile to Minnesota on June 1, 1987. T did not have an abode in Minnesota prior to June 1, 1987. T was physically present in Minnesota throughout the period of June 1, 1987 to December 31, 1987.</p>
                  <p>T was a part year resident of Minnesota in 1987. Although T was physically present in Minnesota over one-half of the year, T did not have a Minnesota abode during the part of the year T was domiciled outside the state. Therefore, the physical presence test does not apply.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">6</inline>. <b>Reciprocity exclusion.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Minnesota gross income does not include personal or professional service income earned in Minnesota by a resident of Wisconsin, North Dakota, or Michigan. A resident of North Dakota or Michigan can use this provision only if the resident customarily returns at least once a month to their residence in that state. Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Michigan are the only three states that have reciprocity exclusion agreements with the state of Minnesota. The income subject to reciprocity exclusion is compensation for the performance of personal or professional services which the taxpayer personally renders. It is not enough to employ others to render these services.</p>
                  <p>A. The reciprocity exclusion does not apply where the personal or professional service income is earned as part of a business operated by the taxpayer which has employees that do more than incidental duties for the business or where there is the sale or delivery of goods which are more than an incidental part of the business. The reciprocity exclusion does apply to all the personal or professional income earned in the business where the sale of goods and the services of the employees are incidental. Where a partner is a member of a partnership where the selling of goods or the services of employees is more than incidental to the partnership business, reciprocity exclusion would apply only to the partner's salary (personal or professional service income) but not to the distributive shares of the partnership business. Salaries would be subject to a reasonableness test and a provision for salaries must be part of the partnership agreement. If there is no written partnership agreement, or if in the written agreement no salary or salary formula is specifically provided, the payment to the partners is a partnership distribution and is not subject to reciprocity exclusion. Partnership draw does not constitute a salary; it is a convenience to the partners in withdrawing a share of their business equity. If all partners are performing personal services and the sale of goods and the services of the employees are incidental, the reciprocity exclusion applies to the partner's salary and to the partner's distributive share. The imputed income of a shareholder of an electing small business corporation (Subchapter S) is not subject to reciprocity exclusion as this income is in the form of a partnership distribution.</p>
                  <p>B. The word "incidental" means the sale of goods or the services of employees which are only a minor or secondary contribution to the personal service income of the individual or partnership for whom performed. The sale of goods or the services of employees is incidental if for the sale of goods the gross profit (gross receipts less cost of goods sold) or for the services of employees the total compensation paid the employees is less than $20,000 or ten percent of the gross profit of the business, whichever is greater. The total compensation paid the employees and the gross profit from the sale of goods must be totaled when determining if the goods and employees are incidental.</p>
                  <p>C. If an individual's total income assignable to Minnesota is subject to reciprocity exclusion, that individual need not file a Minnesota income tax return. However, if that individual has Minnesota income, some of which is subject to reciprocity exclusion and some of which is not subject to reciprocity exclusion and if the income which is not subject to reciprocity exclusion exceeds the filing requirements for filing a Minnesota income tax return, that individual must file a Minnesota income tax return. That individual should use the appropriate federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year. A subtraction would be allowed at a subsequent point on the return to remove income which is subject to reciprocity exclusion.</p>
                  <p>In order to claim the reciprocity exclusion, individuals should file form M-115, which is an affidavit claim for exemption of compensation received for services performed under the reciprocity exclusion. Although the exact form may change, the following information will be required:</p>
                  <p>(1) name, address, and social security number of the individual;</p>
                  <p>(2) year for which the affidavit is being submitted;</p>
                  <p>(3) amount of income received for services performed in Minnesota subject to reciprocity exclusion;</p>
                  <p>(4) a statement whether or not Minnesota income tax was withheld on that income;</p>
                  <p>(5) the name and address of the employer;</p>
                  <p>(6) type of services performed in Minnesota;</p>
                  <p>(7) state in which the individual maintains residence;</p>
                  <p>(8) the year in which the individual became a resident of the state;</p>
                  <p>(9) a statement disclosing whether or not the individual customarily returns to the individual's residence in the other state at least once a month;</p>
                  <p>(10) a statement whether or not the individual filed an income tax return with that state and whether the income subject to reciprocity exclusion was declared on that return; and</p>
                  <p>(11) a statement declaring if the individual ever was a resident of Minnesota and, if so, when was the date of last residence.</p>
                  <p>An individual whose income is subject to reciprocity exclusion may also want to complete a withholding exemption certificate, form MW-6.</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 290.0132, subdivision 2, allows an individual taxpayer, an estate, or a trust to subtract the amount of interest earned on certain obligations of the United States government from federal taxable income. To qualify for this subtraction, the obligation must meet the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>A. For the purposes of these conditions, "interest" includes:</p>
                  <p>(1) income reported federally as ordinary income pursuant to sections 454 and 1271 through 1286 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through June 30, 2001; and</p>
                  <p>(2) dividends from regulated investment companies as defined by section 851(a) or (g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through June 30, 2001, to the extent that the income of the regulated investment company is derived from interest on federal obligations and is reported federally as dividend income by shareholders.</p>
                  <p>B. The obligation must be an obligation of the United States of America, whether through an agency, authority, commission, or instrumentality of the United States, and must be exempt from state taxation under federal law.</p>
                  <p>C. The obligation must be in writing, bear interest, contain a binding promise by the United States to pay specified sums on specified dates, and be specifically authorized by Congress. Open accounts and other unsettled claims or demands are not obligations of the United States for the purposes of this part.</p>
                  <p>D. The obligation must be a direct and primary obligation of the United States. If the primary obligor is not the United States and the United States is merely an insurer or guarantor and has only a secondary or contingent liability, the interest income is not exempt. If the primary obligor is not the United States but the United States pays all or part of the interest on the obligation, the interest income is not exempt. If the obligation was originally a private obligation and if the obligee later gives up all rights against the original obligor as part of an insurance endorsement or otherwise, and agrees to look only to the United States for payment of both principal and interest, then the obligation has become a primary obligation of the United States and the interest income from it is exempt from state taxation.</p>
                  <p>E. The interest income on the obligation must have been included in federal taxable income for the taxable year that subtraction is claimed. If only a portion of the interest income on an obligation has been included in federal taxable income, only the included portion may be subtracted. Where the interest is in the form of dividends from a regulated investment company and all of the regulated investment company's interest is derived from interest on obligations that are exempt from state taxation by federal law, the full amount of the dividends received by shareholders may be subtracted. Where less than the full amount is derived from interest on exempt obligations, the amount to be subtracted is determined as follows:</p>

                  <p>Subpart 3 contains a list of securities that are exempt from Minnesota income tax and for which a subtraction is allowed. Subpart 4 contains a list of securities that are subject to Minnesota income tax and for which no subtraction is allowed. Subparts 5 and 6 contain lists of various federal agencies or related organizations that either generally issue exempt obligations or generally issue taxable obligations. These lists are not intended to be conclusive on the taxable status of any particular obligation issued by or in conjunction with a listed agency or organization. Even though a listed agency generally only issues either exempt obligations or taxable obligations, it does not follow that each and every obligation carrying the name of that particular agency is either exempt or taxable. An agency may issue its own obligations that are exempt and also may handle private obligations that are not exempt. For example, the agency may administer, purchase and sell, insure, or guarantee an otherwise private obligation. Such action by the agency does not convert a private obligation into a direct and primary obligation of the United States of America and, therefore, does not make the private obligation tax exempt. The taxable status of each obligation must be determined separately in accordance with subpart 1, items A to E.</p>

                  <p>If, during the taxable year, the taxpayer is entitled under other provisions of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 290 to a deduction of more than $3,000 because of the restoration to another of an item which was included in the taxpayer's gross income for a prior taxable year (or years) under a claim of right, the tax imposed by Minnesota Statutes, chapter 290 for the taxable year shall be the tax provided in subpart 2.</p>
                  <p>For the purpose of this part "income included under a claim of right" means an item included in gross income because it appeared from all the facts available in the year of inclusion that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item, and "restoration to another" means a restoration resulting because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year (or years) that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item (or portion thereof).</p>
                  <p>For purposes of determining whether the amount of a deduction described in Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 exceeds $3,000 for the taxable year, there shall be taken into account the aggregate of all such deductions with respect to each item of income (described in Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 of the same class).</p>

                  <p>Under the circumstances described in subpart 1, the tax imposed by Minnesota Statutes, chapter 290 for the taxable year shall be the lesser of:</p>
                  <p>A. the tax for the taxable year computed under Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 that is, with the deduction taken into account; or</p>
                  <p>B. the tax for the taxable year computed without taking such deduction into account, minus the decrease in tax under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 290 for the prior taxable year (or years) which would result solely from the exclusion from gross income of all or that portion of the income included under a claim of right to which the deduction is attributable.</p>
                  <p>For the purpose of this subpart, the amount of the decrease in tax is not limited to the amount of the tax for the taxable year. See item A where the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) exceeds the tax for the taxable year.</p>
                  <p>If the taxpayer computes the tax for the taxable year under item B, the amount of the restoration shall not be taken into account in computing taxable income or loss for the taxable year, including the computation of any net operating loss carryback or carryover or any capital loss carryover.</p>
                  <p>If the tax determined under item A is the same as the tax determined under item B, the tax imposed for the taxable year under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 290 shall be the tax determined under item A, and this part shall not otherwise apply.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">4</inline>. <b>Determination of decrease in tax for prior taxable years.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The prior taxable year (or years) referred to in subpart 2 is the year (or years) in which the item to which the deduction is attributable was included in gross income under a claim of right and, in addition, any other prior taxable year (or years) the tax for which will be affected by the exclusion from gross income in such prior taxable year (or years) of such income.</p>
                  <p>A. The amount to be excluded from gross income for the prior taxable year (or years) in determining the decrease in tax under subpart 2, item B, shall be the amount restored in the taxable year, but shall not exceed the amount included in gross income in the prior taxable year (or years) under the claim of right to which the deduction for the restoration is attributable, and shall be adjusted as provided in item B.</p>
                  <p>B. If the amount included in gross income for the prior taxable year (or years) under the claim of right in question was reduced in such year (or years) by a deduction allowed under Minnesota Statutes, section 290.16, subdivision 4 then the amount determined under item A to be excluded from gross income for such year (or years) shall be reduced in the same proportion that the amount included in gross income under a claim of right was reduced.</p>
                  <p>C. The determination of the amount of the exclusion from gross income of the prior taxable year shall be made without regard to the capital loss limitation contained in Minnesota Statutes, section 290.16, subdivision 5 applicable in computing taxable income for the current taxable year. The amount of the exclusion from gross income in a prior taxable year (or years) shall not exceed the amount which would, but for the application of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.16, subdivision 5, be allowable as a deduction in the taxable year of restoration.</p>
                  <p>D. The rule provided in item C may be illustrated as follows: For the taxable year 1957, an individual taxpayer had long-term capital gains of $50,000 and long-term capital losses of $10,000, a net long-term gain of $40,000. The taxpayer also had other income of $5,000. In 1961 taxpayer restored the $50,000 of long-term gain. The taxpayer had no capital gains or losses in 1961 but had other income of $5,000. If the tax liability for 1961, the taxable year of restoration, is computed by taking the deduction into account, the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction under Minnesota Statutes, section 290.16, subdivision 5 of only $1,000 on account of the capital loss. However, if the taxpayer computes the tax under subpart 2, item B, it is necessary to determine the decrease in tax for 1957. In such a determination, $50,000 is to be excluded from gross income for that year, resulting in a net capital loss for that year of $10,000, and a capital loss deduction of $1,000 under Minnesota Statutes, section 290.16, subdivision 5 with carryover privileges. The difference between the tax previously determined and the tax as recomputed after such exclusion for the years affected will be the amount of the decrease.</p>
                  <p>E. If the deduction otherwise allowable for the taxable year relates to income included in gross income under a claim of right in more than one prior taxable year and the amount attributable to each such prior taxable year cannot be readily identified, then the portion attributable to each such prior taxable year shall be that portion of the deduction otherwise allowable for the taxable year which the amount of the income included under the claim of right in question for the prior taxable year bears to the total of all such income included under the claim of right for all such prior taxable years.</p>
                  <p>The rule provided in this item may be illustrated as follows: Under a claim of right, A included in gross income over a period of three taxable years an aggregate of $9,000 for services to a certain employer, in amounts as follows: $2,000 for taxable year 1952, $4,000 for taxable year 1953, and $3,000 for taxable year 1954. In 1955 it is established that A must restore $6,750 of these amounts to A's employer, and that A is entitled to a deduction of this amount in the taxable year 1955. The amount of the deduction attributable to each of the prior taxable years cannot be identified. Accordingly, the amount of the deduction attributable to each prior taxable year is:</p>

                  <p>F. In computing the amount of decrease in tax for a prior taxable year (or years) resulting from the exclusion from gross income of the income included under a claim of right, there must first be ascertained the amount of tax previously determined for the taxpayer for such prior taxable year (or years). The tax previously determined shall be the sum of the amounts shown by the taxpayer on the return or returns, plus any amounts which have been previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies or which appropriately should be assessed or collected, reduced by the amount of any refunds or credits which have previously been made or which appropriately should be made. After the tax previously determined has been ascertained, a recomputation must then be made to determine the decrease in tax, if any, resulting from the exclusion from gross income of all or that portion of the income included under a claim of right to which the deduction otherwise allowable in the taxable year is attributable.</p>
                  <p>No item other than the exclusion of the income previously included under a claim of right shall be considered in computing the amount of decrease in tax if reconsideration of such other item is prevented by the operation of any provision of the income tax laws or any other rule of law. However, if the amounts of other items in the return are dependent upon the amount of adjusted gross income, taxable income, or net income (such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, deductions for depletion, and net operating loss), appropriate adjustment shall be made as part of the computation of the decrease in tax. For the purpose of determining the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) which would result from the exclusion from gross income of the item included under a claim of right, the exclusion of such item shall be given effect not only in the prior taxable year in which it was included in gross income but in all other prior taxable years affected by the inclusion of the item (for example, prior taxable years affected by a net operating loss carryback or carryover or capital loss carryover).</p>
                  <p>The rules provided in this item may be illustrated as follows:</p>
                  <p>Example 1. For the taxable year 1954, a corporation has taxable income of $35,000, on which it paid a tax of $2,000. Included in gross income for the year was $20,000 received under a claim of right as royalties. In 1957, the corporation is required to return $10,000 of the royalties. It otherwise has taxable income in 1957 of $5,000, so that without the application of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 it has a net operating loss of $5,000 in that year.</p>
                  <p>Facts also come to light in 1957 which entitle the corporation to an additional deduction of $5,000 for 1954. When a computation is made under subpart 2, item A, the corporation has no tax for the taxable year 1957. When a computation is made under subpart 2, item B, the tax for 1957, without taking the restoration into account, is $365, based on a taxable income of $5,000. The decrease in tax for 1954 is computed as follows:</p>

                  <p>Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that, instead of the corporation being entitled to an additional deduction of $5,000 for 1954, it is determined that the corporation failed to include an item of $5,000 in gross income for that year.

                  <p>The provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 and this part shall be applicable in the case of a taxpayer on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting only to the taxable year in which the item of income included in a prior year (or years) under a claim of right is actually repaid. However, in the case of a taxpayer on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting who constructively received an item of income under a claim of right and included such item of income in gross income in a prior year (or years), the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 and this part shall be applicable to the taxable year in which the taxpayer is required to relinquish the right to receive such item of income. Such provisions shall be applicable in the case of other taxpayers only to the taxable year which is the proper taxable year (under the method of accounting used by the taxpayer in computing taxable income) for taking into account the deduction resulting from the restoration of the item of income included in a prior year (or years) under a claim of right. For example, if the taxpayer is on an accrual method of accounting, the provisions of this section shall apply to the year in which the obligation properly accrues for the repayment of the item included under a claim of right.</p>

                  <p>Except for amounts specified in the following paragraph, the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 and this part do not apply to deductions attributable to items which were included in gross income by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade of the taxpayer (or other property of a kind which would properly have been included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the prior taxable year) or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business. This part is, therefore, not applicable to sales returns and allowances and similar items.</p>
                  <p>The provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 and this part apply to deductions which arise out of refunds or repayments made by a regulated public utility, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, section 1503 (c)(1) or (3) and the Federal Tax Regulations, section 1.1502-2 (g), if such refunds or repayments are required to be made by the government, political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality referred to in such regulation. Thus, deductions attributable to refunds of charges for the sale of natural gas under rates approved temporarily by a proper governmental authority are eligible for the benefits of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 and this part, if such refunds are required by the governmental authority.</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 and this part do not apply to legal fees or other expenses incurred by a taxpayer in contesting the restoration of an item previously included in income. This rule may be illustrated by the following example:</p>
                  <p>A sold A's personal residence to B in a prior taxable year and realized a capital gain on the sale. C claimed that under an agreement with A, C was entitled to a five percent share of the purchase price since C brought the parties together and was instrumental in closing the sale. A rejected C's demand and included the entire amount of the capital gain in gross income for the year of sale. C instituted action and in the taxable year judgment is rendered against A who pays C the amount involved. In addition, A pays legal fees in the taxable year which were incurred in the defense of the action. Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4 applies to the payment of the five percent share of the purchase price to C. However, the payment of the legal fees, whether or not otherwise deductible, does not constitute an item restored for purposes of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.07, subdivision 4.</p>

Such payment is deemed to have been made on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of tax for the taxable year and shall be refunded or credited in the same manner as if it were an overpayment of tax for such taxable year.</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 290.17, subdivision 3, provides that the net income of a trade or business carried on partly in and partly out of this state must be apportioned between this state and other states. Minnesota Statutes, section 290.191, provides general rules for the apportionment of the net income of a trade or business carried on partly in and partly out of this state. Minnesota Statutes, section 290.20, provides that if the methods prescribed by Minnesota Statutes, section 290.191, do not fairly reflect the net income allocable to this state, the commissioner of revenue may require the use of another method. The nature of the air carrier business requires use of a method other than those prescribed by Minnesota Statutes, section 290.191.</p>

                  <p>The definitions in this subpart apply to this part.</p>
                  <p>A. "Air carrier" means a person engaged in the paid carriage of passengers, cargo, or mail on regularly scheduled flights of aircraft.</p>
                  <p>B. "Aircraft" means a contrivance used or designed for the navigation of flight in the air.</p>
                  <p>C. "Airport-to-airport mileage" means the mileage, as determined by the United States Department of Transportation, between airports that are the point of origination and termination of a flight in service.</p>
                  <p>D. "Cargo ton mile" means the paid carriage of one ton of cargo for one mile.</p>
                  <p>E. "Departures" means departures of an aircraft while operating a flight in revenue service.</p>
                  <p>F. "Fixed property and payroll" means all property and payroll not defined as flight property or flight payroll.</p>
                  <p>G. "Fleet type" means each series within an aircraft model.</p>
                  <p>H. "Flight in revenue service" means the flight of an aircraft for the paid carriage of cargo, mail, or passengers.</p>
                  <p>I. "Flight payroll" means the payroll of persons engaged as staff, such as pilots and flight attendants, on the air carrier's aircraft.</p>
                  <p>J. "Flight property" means aircraft ready for flight, spare engines, and spare parts inventory that rotates into aircraft. Inventory that rotates is inventory that consists of aircraft parts that are replacements for defective or worn parts and may be placed into an aircraft for use more than one time.</p>
                  <p>K. "Mail ton mile" means the paid carriage of one ton of mail for one mile.</p>
                  <p>L. "Minnesota cargo ton mile" means the paid carriage of one ton of cargo for one Minnesota plane mile.</p>
                  <p>M. "Minnesota departures" means departures of aircraft from Minnesota facilities for flights in revenue service.</p>
                  <p>N. "Minnesota mail ton mile" means the paid carriage of one ton of mail for one Minnesota plane mile.</p>
                  <p>O. "Minnesota passenger ton mile" means the paid carriage of one ton of passengers for one Minnesota plane mile.</p>
                  <p>P. "Minnesota plane mile ratio" means the resultant ratio of Minnesota plane miles divided by total plane miles. A separate plane mile ratio must be computed for each fleet type.</p>
                  <p>Q. "Minnesota plane miles" means the number of miles on completed flights in revenue service using airport-to-airport mileage flown from a departure point in Minnesota to the border of the state or flown from the border of Minnesota to a destination within the state. Minnesota plane miles are calculated by multiplying the airport-to-airport mileage by the percentage resulting from the division of the Minnesota distance by total distance for each flight in revenue service. The Minnesota plane miles of a flight in revenue service from a Minnesota departure point to a Minnesota destination is the airport-to-airport mileage.</p>
                  <p>(1) Minnesota distance is the distance from the Minnesota airport to the Minnesota border and the Minnesota border to the Minnesota airport measured on a straight line between the originating airport and the destination airport.</p>
                  <p>(2) Total distance is the distance from the originating airport to the destination airport on a straight line using the same map that was used to measure Minnesota distance.</p>
                  <p>(3) Minnesota distance and total distance must be measured on a conformal conic projection map, used for aviation purposes, meeting the standards for accuracy of the Global Navigation and Planning Chart, United States Defense Mapping Agency, Lambert Conformal Conic Projection Map.</p>
                  <p>R. "Passenger ton mile" means the paid carriage of one ton of passengers for one mile. For this purpose, each passenger is considered to weigh 200 pounds.</p>
                  <p>S. "Plane miles" means the number of miles flown on completed flights in revenue service using airport-to-airport mileage. Plane miles must be accumulated on a fleet type basis.</p>

                  <p>A. The denominator of the receipts factor includes all receipts from the paid carriage of passengers, cargo, and mail.</p>
                  <p>B. The numerator must be 85 percent of the sum of the amounts calculated in subitem (1) plus 15 percent of the sum of the amounts calculated in subitem (2). The Minnesota passenger, cargo, and mail revenue must be determined on a fleet type basis by:</p>
                  <p>(1) (i) multiplying the total gross revenue from the carriage of passengers by the ratio of Minnesota passenger ton miles to total passenger ton miles; (ii) multiplying the total gross revenue from the carriage of cargo by the ratio of Minnesota cargo ton miles to total cargo ton miles; and (iii) multiplying the total gross revenue from the carriage of mail by the ratio of Minnesota mail ton miles to total mail ton miles;</p>
                  <p>(2) (i) multiplying the total gross revenue from the carriage of passengers by the ratio of Minnesota departures to total revenue departures; (ii) multiplying the total gross revenue from the carriage of cargo by the ratio of Minnesota departures to total departures; and (iii) multiplying the total gross revenue from the carriage of mail by the ratio of Minnesota departures to total departures; and</p>
                  <p>(3) if records of either actual passenger revenue, freight revenue, or mail revenue generated by fleet type are not maintained, for purposes of subitems (1) and (2), passenger revenue, cargo revenue, and mail revenue must be allocated to aircraft types based on the ratios of the passenger ton miles, cargo ton miles, and mail ton miles of that fleet type to total system passenger, cargo, and mail ton miles. The computation for each fleet type is as follows:</p>

                  <p>"Unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of value between them. The term is applied to a flow either between multiple entities that are related through common ownership or within a single legal entity, and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership, or a trust. Flow of value is determined by reviewing the totality of facts and circumstances of business activities and operations.</p>
                  <p>Some activities that evidence a flow of value between related corporations include the following: assisting in the acquisition of equipment, assisting with filling personnel needs, lending funds or guaranteeing loans, interplay in the area of corporate expansion, providing technical assistance, supervising, providing general operational guidance, providing overall operational strategic advice, or common use of trade names and patents. Flow of value must be more than the flow of funds arising out of passive investment and consists of more than occasional financial oversight.</p>
                  <p>Transactions separately accounted for may evidence a flow of value. The fact that a business uses or can use a separate accounting system, including, but not limited to, separate accounting between divisions of a single legal entity, between multiple entities under common ownership, on an arm's length basis, on a geographical basis, or by business function, does not determine whether a corporation is operating as a unitary business.</p>

                  <p>A. Business activities or operations carried on by more than one corporation related through common ownership are presumed to be unitary in nature when:</p>
                  <p>(1) the business activities or operations are of mutual benefit, dependent upon, or contributory to one another, individually, or as a group; or</p>
                  <p>(2) there is both unity of operation as evidenced generally by staff functions such as centralized advertising, accounting, financing, management, or centralized, group, or committee purchasing; and</p>
                  <p>(3) there is unity of use as evidenced generally by line functions, centralized executive force, and general system of operation.</p>
                  <p>B. The unitary nature of the business activities or operations is presumed when contributions to income result from functional integration, centralized management, and economies of scale.</p>
                  <p>(1) Examples of functional integration are centralized manufacturing, warehousing, accounting, legal staff, personnel training, financing, retirement plans, corporate-level tax return preparation, or centralized, group, or committee purchasing.</p>
                  <p>(2) Examples of centralized management are common officers or directors, exchange of personnel, frequent communication between management of the corporations, centralized administrative services, companywide payroll processing, common insurance plans, or where the parent must approve of major financial decisions.</p>
                  <p>(3) Examples of economies of scale are commingling of funds, providing centralized services, or elimination of interest expense attributable to common financing.</p>
                  <p>All of the examples are not needed to show functional integration, centralized management, or economies of scale.</p>
                  <p>C. All of the examples in item A, subitems (2) and (3), are not needed to show the unity of operation or unity of use. The presumptions of unity stated in item A, subitem (1), are independent from the presumption of unity stated in item A, subitems (2) and (3). The mere ownership of as much as 100 percent of the stock of another corporation does not, in the absence of other indicia of a unitary business, mean that the business of the group is unitary in nature. The presence of any one of the factors contained in subparts 2a and 5 is evidence that the activities of the corporations constitute a unitary trade or business. The presence of any one of the factors contained in subparts 3 and 4 creates a presumption that the activities of the corporations constitute a unitary trade or business.</p>

                  <p>Business activities or operations carried on by more than one corporation, related through common ownership, are generally unitary when the activities of the corporations are in the same general line of business and exhibit functional integration and economies of scale.</p>

                  <p>Business activities or operations carried on by more than one corporation, related through common ownership, are unitary in nature when the various members are engaged in a vertically structured enterprise.</p>
                  <p>For example, assuming that the common ownership requirement is met, a trade or business that is functionally integrated and which benefits from centralized management and controlled interaction which involves the exploration and mining of copper ore by one of the related corporations; the smelting and refining of the copper ore by another of the related corporations; and the fabrication of the refined copper into consumer products by another of the related corporations, is unitary in nature.</p>

                  <p>Centralized management in determining the policies of each corporation in a group of corporations that are related through common ownership indicates that the corporations, which might otherwise be considered to be carrying on separate trades or businesses, are engaged in a unitary trade or business.</p>
                  <p>The fact that the executive officers of one of the corporations in a group of corporations are normally involved in determining the policies respecting the business activities of the other corporations in the group indicates that the group of corporations is carrying on a unitary trade or business.</p>
                  <p>A finding of centralized management is not supported merely by showing that the requisite ownership percentage exists. When a more than incidental economic benefit accrues to a group because such ownership improves its financial position, it indicates that the group is carrying on a unitary trade or business. Both centralized management authority and the exercise of that authority must exist in order to justify a conclusion that unity of use is present.</p>

                  <p>Common ownership does not exist unless the corporation is one which is a member of a group of two or more corporations and more than 50 percent of the voting stock of each member is directly or indirectly owned by a common owner or by common owners, either corporate or noncorporate, or by one or more of the member corporations of the group. The term "common owner" includes the constructive ownership of stock by related taxpayers as provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, section 267, as amended through December 31, 1999. Examples of common ownership are:</p>
                  <p>A. Corporation P owns 51 percent of the voting stock of corporation R1 and corporation R1 owns 51 percent of the voting stock of each of corporations R2 and R3. Common ownership exists among P, R1, R2, and R3.</p>
                  <p>B. Corporation P owns 51 percent of the voting stock of corporation R1, corporation R1 owns 49 percent of the voting stock of corporation R2 and corporation R2 owns 51 percent of the voting stock of R3. Common ownership exists among P and R1 and will be identified as group A. Common ownership exists among R2 and R3 and will be identified as group B. There is no common ownership between group A and group B.</p>

                  <p>The provisions of subparts 1 to 6 may be illustrated by the examples in items A to C.</p>
                  <p>A. Sales corporation owns 51 percent of the outstanding voting stock in each of four subsidiaries: refining corporation, drilling corporation, transport corporation, and research corporation. Sales corporation markets and sells petroleum products in the United States and abroad. Some of the petroleum products are obtained from refining corporation which acquires some of the crude oil from drilling corporation. Transport corporation operates pipeline facilities to transport crude oil from drilling corporation's storage facilities to refining corporation's refineries. Research corporation conducts research and development for both sales and refining corporations. Since the corporations are operating a vertically integrated business and since there is common ownership, the five corporations are conducting a unitary business.</p>
                  <p>B. Corporation A owns 60 percent of the outstanding voting stock in each of three corporations: B, C, and D. Corporation B, in turn, owns 100 percent of the outstanding voting stock in corporation E. Corporation A is primarily engaged in operating multiline department stores in Minnesota and other midwestern states. Corporation B operates a chain of department stores in the northwestern portion of the United States. B's stores sell only high quality, top grade consumer items. Corporation C operates a chain of discount stores throughout the southwestern portion of the United States. Corporation D is a finance company, handling all of the consumer credit and financing arrangements of purchases at the stores owned by corporations A, B, and C. Corporation E is the purchasing agent for corporations A, B, and C and maintains warehouses for the stores' inventories. Corporation A provides management services for all of the other corporations and maintains overall control in determining the policies respecting the primary business activities of the other corporations, including their budgetary and financial affairs. All of these corporations are engaged in the conduct of a unitary business since they are operating a horizontally integrated business and since they have common ownership.</p>
                  <p>C. Corporation K was incorporated in 1945 and thereafter was engaged primarily in activities connected with the manufacture and sale of canned goods. In 1960, K embarked upon a diversification campaign designed to insulate its profits from fluctuations in the demand for canned goods. One hundred percent of the voting stock of corporation L was acquired. Corporation L operated a chain of department stores throughout the United States. In 1961, K purchased 80 percent of the voting stock of corporation M which was engaged primarily in the manufacture and sale of household goods. In 1962, K acquired 75 percent of the voting stock of corporation N which developed and marketed computer software and programs. There was no significant flow of goods between any of the corporations. While these subsidiaries were relatively autonomous in their day-to-day operations, each subsidiary did not operate as a distinct business enterprise at the level of full-time management. Corporation K involved itself in policy determinations respecting the primary business activities of all the corporations. The subsidiaries were required to submit annual budgets to K for approval. Capital expenditures in excess of $500,000 needed approval from K. All of the financing arrangements for the subsidiaries were made by or with the approval of K's management team which authorized and directed intercompany loans when feasible. Tax matters were supervised by K's tax department which prepared the subsidiaries' federal income tax returns. Corporation K also performed centralized warehousing and accounting functions for itself and its subsidiaries. A uniform system of inventory control for corporation K and the subsidiaries was developed and managed by corporation N. Due to the control that corporation K exerted over policy determinations respecting the primary business activities of the subsidiaries and the integration and interdependence occasioned by the centralization of various business functions, all of the corporations are engaged in a unitary business.</p>

A member shall conform its calculation of its corporate franchise tax to the designated member's annual accounting period by:</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 290.17, subdivision 4, provides that if a trade or business conducted wholly within this state, or partly within and partly without this state, is part of a unitary business, the entire income of the unitary business is subject to apportionment under Minnesota Statutes, section 290.191. Minnesota Statutes, section 290.17, subdivision 4, further provides that none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived from any particular source, and none may be allocated to a particular place, except as provided by the applicable apportionment formula. In accordance with the unitary business principle, the aggregation of capital gains and capital losses is permitted or required in combined reporting as follows: for open taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and ending on or before October 19, 1998, corporations may file claims for refund in accordance with this part under Minnesota Statutes, section 289A.40, in effect for the year of the claims; and for taxable years beginning after October 19, 1998, capital losses must be aggregated with capital gains.</p>

                  <p>A. "Capital gain" means the amount of gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets in a taxable year that exceeds the losses from the sale of capital assets in the same taxable year. Capital assets is defined in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                  <p>B. "Capital loss" means the amount of losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets in a taxable year that exceeds the gains from the sale of capital assets in the same taxable year. Capital assets is defined in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

"Change in ownership" means the sale or transfer of voting stock, that is either directly or indirectly owned by a common owner or by common owners, either corporate or noncorporate, of a member of a combined group, which results in 50 percent or less of the voting stock of the member being owned by the previous common owner, or common owners who had owned more than 50 percent of such stock prior to the sale or transfer.</p>
                  <p>D. "Combined group" means two or more corporations that are part of a unitary business as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 290.17, subdivision 4, and that file returns on a combined report basis under part 8019.0405 or Minnesota Statutes, section 290.17 or 290.34.</p>
                  <p>E. "Member" means a corporation or person whose income is included in a combined report.</p>
                  <p>F. "Net capital loss" means the sum of the capital gains and losses of all of the members of the combined group for a taxable year which results in an overall loss.</p>
                  <p>G. "Open year" means any taxable year for which the Minnesota commissioner of revenue may issue orders of assessment or the taxpayer may file an amended return to claim a credit or refund.</p>

                  <p>In each taxable year, a member must first apply any capital loss to that member's capital gains. Any capital loss not applied and available must then be aggregated with the capital gains and capital losses of the other members of the combined group. Any capital loss not applied after aggregation must then be carried forward to the next taxable year by each member, subject to subpart 4. Any capital losses not applied through aggregation must be retained by the member that sustained the loss, and that member must carry the loss forward to the next tax year, regardless of the combined group to which the member belongs.</p>

                  <p>Proration of capital losses is required when more than one member of a combined group has a capital loss, and the combined group sustains a net capital loss. Proration is necessary in order to determine the amount of capital loss used by each member in aggregation, and the amount that is subsequently available for carryover. For any tax year that a combined group has two or more members with capital losses, and the combined group has a net capital loss, each member's capital loss must be aggregated based on its pro rata share of the combined group's total capital loss. The pro rata share of each member's capital loss to be applied to the capital gains is the sum of the capital gains for all the members having capital gains, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the member's capital loss, and the denominator of which is the total capital losses for all members of the combined group that had capital losses. The pro rata share of the member's capital loss not used in aggregation must then be available for carryover.</p>

If the methods of apportionment required by that section do not fairly reflect all or any part of the taxable net income allocable to this state, the taxpayer may petition for the determination of net income by use of another method.

                <p>In any case where a corporation, which is subject to Minnesota corporate franchise tax, conducts business transactions with its members or stockholders, or with any person or corporation interested in the business of the corporation, in a manner as to reduce the taxable net income attributable to this state, or affect the amount of credit against the tax, or both, the commissioner may determine the income of the corporation to reflect what would have been its reasonable taxable net income or tax credit but for such business transaction. Among others, the following devices commonly employed to distort income attributable to this state will not be recognized in determining the tax:</p>
                <p>A. the purchase or sale, by or between corporations or others, at a price greater or less than the price paid in the usual course of business by independent purchasers;</p>
                <p>B. the fixing of income at an arbitrary figure by contract or agreement;</p>
                <p>C. the payment of arbitrary amounts for so-called advisory, management, or counseling services;</p>
                <p>D. arbitrary charges for, or allocation of, improper overhead expenses, such as officers' salaries, rents, auditing, etc.;</p>
                <p>E. arbitrary agreements for the purchase, or sale of, goods or services at fixed prices, or on a basis of cost, actual or estimated, or on a basis of cost plus a fixed percentage or amount.</p>

                  <p>A. A joint return must be signed by both the husband and wife unless the return is made by an agent of both the husband and wife, or one spouse signs as the agent of the other. Any spouse who makes a joint return through an agent assumes the responsibility for making the return and incurs liability for the penalty provided for erroneous, false, or fraudulent returns. One spouse cannot sign as the agent of the other unless the return is accompanied by a power of attorney authorizing such action by the spouse not signing the return. Other agents must also submit their power of attorney with the return.</p>
                  <p>B. Notwithstanding item A, if one spouse is unable to sign the return because of disease or injury, the other spouse may sign the incapacitated spouse's name to the return with the oral consent of the incapacitated spouse. Any return signed under this exception must contain a statement indicating the reason for the inability of the spouse who is incapacitated to sign the return and that the incapacitated person consented to the signing.</p>

It will be presumed that the taxpayer intended to make a designation when more than 90 days have elapsed since the taxpayer received the refund check or a notice informing the taxpayer that a designation was made to the nongame wildlife management fund with the following two exceptions:</p>
                  <p>A. The taxpayer has a valid explanation showing why no action was taken within the 90-day period. Examples of a valid reason are sickness or being outside of the country.</p>
                  <p>B. The taxpayer considered the designation to the nongame wildlife management fund as a payment of estimated income tax and properly reported for this amount as an estimated tax payment on the taxpayer's income tax return for the following year.</p>

A taxpayer may not receive a refund prior to filing a tax return for the year for which the estimated tax has been paid unless one of the conditions in items A to D is met:</p>
                  <p>A. The taxpayer made duplicate payments of the same installment of estimated tax.</p>
                  <p>B. The department credited to the taxpayer's account an amount that was meant to be paid to the Internal Revenue Service or some other entity.</p>
                  <p>C. The taxpayer erred in having an overpayment applied to estimated tax. When making this determination, the commissioner shall examine the tax liability of the taxpayer for the year of the overpayment and prior years, the taxpayer's history of applying overpayments to estimated tax, the taxpayer's history of making estimated tax payments, and the amount of time between when the taxpayer realized the error and when the taxpayer requested the refund.</p>
                  <p>D. The facts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that the taxpayer did not intend to make an estimated payment.</p>
                  <p>A change in circumstances, such as moving from Minnesota or change in economic conditions, does not constitute grounds for allowing refunds prior to filing of a return.</p>

                  <p>The term "practice" comprehends all matters connected with the presentation by an attorney, accountant, agent, or preparer to the Department of Revenue or any of its employees, of a client's rights, privileges, or liabilities under a law administered by the commissioner as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.01, subdivision 5, and the rules thereunder. "Practice" includes the preparation and filing of necessary documents, correspondence with and communication to the Department of Revenue, and the representation of a client at conferences, hearings, and meetings. However, the preparation and signing of a tax return, the appearance of an individual as a witness for a taxpayer, and the furnishing of information at the request of the Department of Revenue or any of its employees do not, of and by themselves, constitute practice before the department, unless these acts are coupled with the presentation of a client's case at conferences, hearings, or meetings. For purposes of this rule, the term "practice" is synonymous with "representation," and the term "state tax" is synonymous with a tax or fee imposed by a "law administered by the commissioner."</p>

A written power of attorney is not required if the taxpayer is present. For purposes of this part, "written power of attorney" means the signed original or a copy of the signed original of any of the following:</p>
                  <p>A. the power of attorney form designed and printed by the Department of Revenue;</p>

                  <p>C. a power of attorney under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 523, if it is filled out to include tax matters or generally to include all matters; or</p>
                  <p>D. any other document which has all the necessary legal elements for creating a power of attorney and is broad enough to include tax matters or generally to include all matters.</p>
                  <p>For purposes of this part, a power of attorney grants authority to deal with any return as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.01, subdivision 8.</p>
                  <p>For taxes which are classified as private data on individuals or nonpublic data not on individuals, a taxpayer representative may inspect only those state records, files, or documents which are: (a) specifically listed in; (b) directly or indirectly connected with matters specifically listed in; or (c) covered by the terms of, a power of attorney. The signed power of attorney form may be transmitted to the Department of Revenue by facsimile or by electronic transmission as an imaged attachment in a format that cannot be altered.</p>
                  <p>If the taxpayer is not present, a person presenting a power of attorney shall present identification satisfactory to the department employee.</p>

                  <p>The term "payroll period" means the period of service for which a payment of wages is ordinarily made to an employee by the employer. It is immaterial that the wages are not always paid at regular intervals. For example, if an employer ordinarily pays a particular employee for each calendar week at the end of the week, but if for some reason the employee in a given week receives a payment in the middle of the week for the portion of the week already elapsed and receives the remainder at the end of the week, the payroll period is still the calendar week; or if, instead, that employee is sent on a three-week trip by the employer and receives at the end of the trip a single wage payment for three weeks' services, the payroll period is still the calendar week, and the wage payment shall be treated as though it were three separate weekly wage payments.</p>

                  <p>For the purpose of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, an employee can have but one payroll period with respect to wages paid by any one employer. Thus, if an employee is paid a regular wage for a weekly payroll period and in addition thereto is paid supplemental wages (for example, bonuses) determined with respect to a different period, the payroll period is the weekly payroll period.</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, subdivision 2a, provides alternative methods, at the election of the employer, for use in computing the income tax to be collected at source on wages. Under the wage bracket method (see Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, subdivision 2a, clause (3)) the employer is required to deduct and withhold a tax in accordance with the tables prepared by the commissioner. The commissioner may authorize under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, subdivision 2a, clause (7), the employer to withhold the tax on the basis of the employee's average estimated wages with necessary adjustments for any quarter. Before using this method the employer must receive authorization from the commissioner. Applications to use such method must be accompanied by evidence establishing the need for such method.</p>

                  <p>The employer is required to collect the tax by deducting and withholding the amount thereof from the employee's wages as and when paid, either actually or constructively. Wages are constructively paid when they are credited to the account of or set apart for an employee so that they may be drawn upon by the employee at any time although not then actually reduced to possession. To constitute payment in such a case, the wages must be credited to or set apart for the employee without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and must be made available to the employee so that they may be drawn upon at any time, and their payment brought within the employee's own control and disposition.</p>

                  <p>The table applicable to a daily or miscellaneous payroll period shows the tax on the amount of wages for one day. Where the withholding is computed under the rules applicable to a miscellaneous payroll period, the wages and the amounts shown in the table must be placed on a comparable basis. This may be accomplished by reducing the wages paid for the period to a daily basis by dividing the total wages by the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the period. The amount of the tax shown in the table as the tax required to be withheld from the wages, as so reduced to a daily basis, should then be multiplied by the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the period.</p>
                  <p>If wages are paid for a period which is not a payroll period, the amount to be deducted and withheld under the wage bracket method shall be the amount applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
                  <p>If wages are paid to an employee without regard to any particular period, as, for example, commissions paid to a salesperson upon consummation of a sale, the amount of tax to be deducted and withheld shall be determined in the same manner as in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed, beginning with the latest of the following days:</p>
                  <p>A. the first day after the last payment of wages to such employee by such employer in the calendar year;</p>
                  <p>B. the date on which such individual's employment with such employer began in the calendar year; or</p>
                  <p>C. January 1 of such calendar year, and ending with (and including) the date on which such wages are paid.</p>

                  <p>An employee's remuneration may consist of wages paid for a payroll period and supplemental wages, such as bonuses, commissions, and overtime pay, paid for the same or a different period, or without regard to a particular period.

                  <p>The supplemental wages, if paid concurrently with wages for a payroll period, shall be aggregated with the wages paid for such payroll period. If not paid concurrently, the supplemental wages shall be aggregated with the wages paid or to be paid within the same calendar year for the last preceding payroll period or for the current payroll period. The amount of tax to be withheld shall be determined as if the aggregate of the supplemental wages and the regular wages constituted a single wage payment for the regular payroll period.</p>
                  <p>In cases where supplemental wages are not paid concurrently with wages for a payroll period the employer may determine the amount of tax required to be withheld in accordance with this paragraph rather than in accordance with the provisions of the previous paragraph. In such a case the withholding of tax on such supplemental payments shall be at the rate provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, subdivision 3, paragraph (d), as if no exemption had been claimed.</p>

                  <p>A. Step 1. Determine an average wage for each of such payroll periods by dividing the sum of the supplemental wages and the wages paid for such payroll periods by the number of such payroll periods.</p>
                  <p>B. Step 2. Determine a tax for each payroll period as if the amount of the average wage constituted the wages paid for such payroll period.</p>

                  <p>An employer, in computing the amount to be deducted and withheld as tax in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, may elect to disregard any wages paid, after October 1, 1961, in a medium other than cash for services performed by an employee if the noncash remuneration is paid for services performed by the employee as a retail commission salesperson, and the employer ordinarily pays the employee remuneration solely by way of cash commissions for services performed as a retail commission salesperson.</p>
                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, subdivision 10, and this part are not applicable with respect to noncash wages paid to a retail commission salesperson for services performed in a capacity other than as such a salesperson. Such parts are not applicable with respect to noncash wages paid by an employer to an employee for services performed as a retail commission salesperson if the employer ordinarily pays the employee remuneration other than by way of cash commissions for such services. Thus, noncash remuneration may not be disregarded in computing the amount to be deducted and withheld in a case where the employee, for services performed as a retail commission salesperson, is paid both a salary and cash commissions on sales, or is ordinarily paid in something other than cash (stocks, bonds, or other forms of property) notwithstanding that the amount of remuneration paid to the employee is measured by sales.</p>

                  <p>For purposes of Minnesota Statutes, section 290.92, subdivision 10, and this part, the term "retail commission salesperson" includes an employee who is engaged in the solicitation of orders at retail, that is, from the ultimate consumer, for merchandise or other products offered for sale by the employee's employer. The term does not include an employee salesperson engaged in the solicitation on behalf of an employer of orders from wholesalers, retailers, or others for merchandise for resale. However, if the salesperson solicits orders for more than one principal, the salesperson is not excluded from the term solely because he or she solicits orders from wholesalers or retailers on behalf of one or more principals. In such case the salesperson may be a retail commission salesperson with respect to services performed for one or more principals and not with respect to services performed for the other principals.</p>

                  <p>The fact that joint estimated tax payments are made does not preclude a husband and wife from filing separate returns. If joint estimated payments are made but the husband and wife file separate returns for that tax year, the joint estimated payments may be treated as payments of either spouse for the taxable year or may be divided between them in such manner as they may agree. In the event the husband and wife fail to agree to a division, the payments must be allocated in accordance with the following rule: the joint estimated payments are allocated to a spouse in the same ratio that the amount of tax shown on the separate return of the spouse bears to the sum of the taxes shown on the separate returns of the spouses.</p>

                <p>The commissioner of revenue establishes an estimate of the unit value for each utility company operating within the state. The entire system is valued utilizing data relating to the cost of the property, the earnings of the company owning or operating the property, and additional indicators of value where applicable. The resulting valuation is allocated to each state in which the utility company operates. The value of property located in Minnesota that is exempt from property tax or that is locally assessed is subtracted from the value allocated to Minnesota. Next, by the process of apportionment, the portion allocated to Minnesota is distributed to the various taxing districts within the state. The data used in the valuation, allocation, and apportionment process is drawn from reports submitted to the Department of Revenue by the utility companies. These reports include Minnesota Department of Revenue Annual Utility Reports (UTL forms), Reports to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, Annual Reports to Shareholders, Annual Reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Utility Service or equivalent, and other publicly available sources of information regarding rates. Periodic examinations of the supporting data for these reports are made by the Department of Revenue. Finally, the value is equalized based on sales/assessment ratios determined by the Department of Revenue.</p>
                <p>The commissioner of revenue reserves the right to exercise discretion whenever the circumstances of a valuation estimate dictate the need for it. Discretion may be used to ensure a balance between a prescriptive rule and sound appraisal judgment; to ensure that all relevant data pertaining to value is considered; to ensure that a reasonable estimate of market value is derived; to address concerns of predictability and stability in estimations of market value; and to ensure that utility valuation is easily understood and administered.</p>

                  <p>Because of the unique character of public utility companies, the traditional approaches to valuation estimates of property (cost, capitalized income, and market) must be modified when utility property is valued. Consequently, the value of utility company property is estimated in the manner provided in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>All indicators of value must be considered to determine their validity relating to the specific property being valued. If an indicator is not demonstrated to be reliable or of value for the specific property being appraised it must not be used.</p>

                  <p>A. The cost factor to be considered in the utility valuation formula is the original cost less depreciation of the system plant, plus the cost of improvements to the system plant, plus the original cost of all types of construction work in progress that are installed by the assessment date, plus the cost of property held for future use, plus the cost of contributions in aid of construction. Original cost less depreciation is presumed to be equal to historical cost less depreciation. For rate-regulated companies, the commissioner must use the same type of cost that is used in the rate base calculation.</p>
                  <p>B. The original cost of any leased operating property used by the utility must be reported to the commissioner in conjunction with the annual utility report. If the original cost of the leased operating property is not available, the commissioner shall make an estimate of the cost by capitalizing the lease payments.</p>
                  <p>C. If a conflict of opinion exists regarding the character of specific property, whether it is operating or nonoperating property, assessors or utility companies may request a determination by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>D. Depreciation is not allowed on construction work in progress. Depreciation is allowed as a deduction from cost in the amount allowed on the accounting records of the utility company, as such records are required to be maintained by the appropriate regulatory agency, except that depreciation may be reduced if available information indicates the amount deducted does not equal actual accrued depreciation when the current estimated remaining life is considered.</p>

                  <p>The income indicator of value is estimated by weighting the capitalized net operating earnings of the utility company for the most recent three years as follows: most recent year, 40 percent; previous year, 35 percent; and final year, 25 percent. Utilities may request the removal of nonrecurring items of income or expense. The commissioner must determine if removal of the item is appropriate. The net income is capitalized by applying a capitalization rate that is computed by using the band of investment method. This method considers:</p>
                  <p>A. the capital structure of utilities;</p>
                  <p>B. the cost of debt or interest rate;</p>
                  <p>C. the yield on preferred stock of utilities;</p>
                  <p>D. the yield on common stock of utilities; and</p>
                  <p>E. the risk-free rate, relative risk, and risk premiums for public utility companies.</p>
                  <p>Capitalization rates are computed for electric companies, gas distribution companies, natural gas transmission systems, and fluid pipeline companies. The rates are recalculated each year using the method described in this subpart.</p>

                  <p>Additional indicators of value, other than the cost and income indicators, may exist in some situations. When additional indicators of value exist, the commissioner has the discretion to use these additional indicators in computing the unit value of a utility. Additional indicators of value include, but are not limited to, the market indicator.</p>
                  <p>A. If the commissioner determines that the market indicator can be quantified, is reliable, and is indicative of value for a company, the commissioner has the discretion to adjust the weightings of the cost and income indicators to give weight to the market indicator in the unit value computation. If the market indicator is used, the weighting for the market indicator must not exceed five percent.</p>
                  <p>B. If the commissioner finds that economic or other forms of obsolescence exists, the commissioner has the discretion to adjust the weightings in the correlation process described in subpart 5 or make other adjustments in its methodology consistent with these rules and applicable statutes.</p>
                  <p>C. If the commissioner uses additional indicators of value, the commissioner must state in writing the findings that necessitate deviation from the default weightings of 50 percent for cost indicator and 50 percent for income indicator, as described in subpart 5.</p>

                  <p>After assessment year 2007, cooperative associations have the option to irrevocably elect the method under which they are valued.</p>
                  <p>A. For assessment year 2007, each cooperative must be valued in the same manner as it was valued in assessment year 2006, using either the unit value method or cost less depreciation method.</p>
                  <p>B. Beginning in assessment year 2008, cooperative associations that were valued under the cost less depreciation method in assessment year 2007 may irrevocably elect to be valued using the unit value method described in subparts 1 to 5. Elections made by a cooperative association prior to November 1 of any year are effective the next assessment year. Such elections must be in a format prescribed by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>C. Prior to November 1 of assessment year 2008, cooperative associations that were valued under the unit value method in assessment year 2007 may irrevocably elect to be valued under the cost less depreciation method. Such elections will be in a format prescribed by the commissioner. Cooperative associations that do not elect to revert back to valuation using cost less depreciation method prior to November 1 of assessment year 2008, are deemed to have irrevocably elected to be valued using the unit value method.</p>

                  <p>Cooperative associations may irrevocably elect to have their property valued using the unit value method described in subparts 1 to 5. Cooperative associations not electing unit valuation and other types of utilities which do not operate in the traditional profit-making mode, are not common carriers, or are nonregulated, must have their utility property valued on the basis of cost less depreciation. Elections made by a cooperative association prior to November 1 of any year are effective the next assessment year. Such elections must be in a format prescribed by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>A. Depreciation is allowed as a deduction from the original cost in increments of 2-1/2 percent per year, but the maximum depreciation allowed must not exceed 75 percent of the cost of the utility operating property. Additions to existing utility property are depreciated 2-1/2 percent per year until they reach the 75 percent maximum. Retirements of utility property are deducted from the cost basis at the average depreciation level of all of the company's taxable property.</p>
                  <p>B. Cost less depreciation is calculated by using the following inputs: the total cost at the end of the year preceding the assessment year; total depreciation at the beginning of the year preceding the assessment year; total cost at the beginning of the year preceding the assessment year; and the original cost of property retired during the year preceding the assessment year.</p>
                  <p>Depreciation for the year is calculated by multiplying the total cost at the end of the year preceding the assessment year by 2-1/2 percent. Depreciation on retirements is calculated by dividing the total depreciation for the year preceding the assessment year by total cost at the beginning of the year preceding the assessment year. This number is then multiplied by the original cost of retirements for the year; the result is equal to the depreciation on retirements for the year.</p>
                  <p>Net depreciation for the year is calculated by adding the total depreciation at the beginning of the year preceding the assessment year and the depreciation for the year, and then subtracting the depreciation on retirements for the year. Net depreciated value for the year is equal to the total cost at the end of the year preceding the assessment year less net depreciation for the year. Net depreciated value for the assessment year is the total market value for all property owned by the company.</p>
                  <p>A company factor is calculated by dividing the net depreciated value for the assessment year by the total cost at the end of the year preceding the assessment year. The factor is multiplied by the cost of each individual parcel at the end of the year preceding the assessment year to derive the market value of each individual parcel.</p>
                  <p>C. The following example illustrates this process for an electric cooperative association electing cost less depreciation valuation under this subpart for assessment year 2006.</p>

                  <p>Utility operating property may be retired from the utility system while still in place if certain criteria are met:</p>
                  <p>A. The property must be physically disconnected from the utility system. In the case of electrical plants, the disconnection or dismantling of wires, cables, connectors, or transformers constitutes physical disconnection. In the case of pipelines, the disconnection of pipes, valves, or fittings is evidence of physical disconnection.</p>
                  <p>B. An affidavit of retirement must be filed by the utility with the commissioner at least 30 days prior to the assessment date. This affidavit must indicate the facility being retired and the date it was taken out of service.</p>
                  <p>C. The utility must make every effort to inform the commissioner of pending major retirements. The commissioner in turn shall notify the county assessor of impending major retirements as soon as this information becomes available to the department.</p>
                  <p>D. Utility real property which is retired in place must continue to be taxed for ad valorem purposes. However, its market value is not determined on the basis of its value as utility operating property.</p>
                  <p>E. If a utility chooses to temporarily retire a facility pending the development of an alternate fuel, greater demand, increased source of supply, or another valid reason, the cost of this facility must be transferred to the appropriate regulatory agency's account entitled "Held for Future Use." Standby facilities are not considered to be temporarily retired unless their costs are carried in this account. Temporarily retired utility facilities are valued taking into account a number of factors including age of the facility, type of facility, amount of maintenance and additional costs needed to restore the facility to operational status, length of retirement, and earning potential of the facility. A temporarily retired facility must not be valued lower than if the facility were considered nonoperating utility property.</p>

                  <p>After the unit value of the utility property has been estimated, the portion of value which is attributable to Minnesota must be determined. Each of the factors in the allocation formula is assigned a weighted percentage to denote the relative importance assigned to that factor. The resulting sum of the weighted factors multiplied by the unit value yields the valuation of the utility property which is, after the adjustments described in part 8100.0500, subject to ad valorem tax in the state of Minnesota.</p>

                  <p>The original cost of the utility property located in Minnesota divided by the total original cost of the property in all states of operation is weighted at 90 percent. Gross revenue derived from operations in Minnesota divided by gross operations revenue from all states is weighted at ten percent.</p>

                  <p>The cost factor that will be considered in the railroad valuation method is the restated cost of the railroad system, plus the restated cost of construction work in progress on the assessment date. The railroad system shall be considered to be made up of the following STB accounts: all road and equipment accounts, including leased equipment accounts; all general expenditures; and other elements of investment and railroad property owned and leased to others as well as railroad property leased from others. Book depreciation and obsolescence shall be allowed as a deduction from the restated cost of the railroad's assets enumerated above. The original cost if known, and the annual lease payments of any leased operating property used by the railroad must be reported to the commissioner in conjunction with the annual railroad report. The commissioner shall incorporate the value of the leased property into the railroad's unit value utilizing this information.</p>
                  <p>Obsolescence will be calculated through the use of the "Blue Chip Method." This method compares the railroad being appraised with the best railroads in the country, the so-called blue chip railroads. Three indicators of obsolescence will be used. First, a five-year average rate of return will be calculated for the railroad under appraisal. This rate of return is computed by dividing the subject's annual net railroad operating income for each of the most recent five years preceding the assessment, by the railroad's total owned transportation property less recorded depreciation and amortization (net investment in railroad property) for each corresponding year. The resulting five rates of return are then averaged using a simple arithmetic average to arrive at a five-year average rate of return. An example of this computation is as follows:</p>

                  <p>Second, a five-year average freight traffic density indicator will be calculated. This indicator is calculated by dividing the subject railroad's ton miles of revenue freight for the most recent five years preceding the assessment by the average miles of road operated for each corresponding year. The resulting five indicators of freight traffic density are then averaged using a simple arithmetic average to arrive at a five-year average of freight traffic density. An example of this computation is as follows:</p>

Each year the railroad with the highest freight traffic density will be selected as the blue chip railroad. The resulting five freight traffic density amounts will then be averaged to find the five-year average blue chip freight traffic density amount. An example of this process is as follows:</p>

                  <p>Third, a five-year average gross profit margin indicator will be calculated. This indicator measures a railroad's ability to convert gross revenue to net profit. This indicator is calculated by dividing net railway operating income, before federal and deferred taxes, by gross revenues. This calculation is performed using the subject railroad income figures for the most recent five years preceding the assessment. The resulting five indicators of gross profit margin are then averaged using a simple arithmetic average to arrive at a five-year average of gross profit margin. An example of this computation is as follows:</p>

                  <p>A study will then be made of the Class I railroads operating within the United States for the same five-year period in the same manner and using the same sources in the two previous five-year studies mentioned above. This study will look at the gross profit margin achieved by the various Class I railroads. Each year the railroad with the highest gross profit margin will be selected as the blue chip railroad. The resulting five gross profit margin percents will then be averaged to find a five-year average blue chip gross profit margin percentage. An example of this process is as follows:</p>

                  <p>The income indicator of value will be calculated by averaging the net railway operating income, as defined by the STB, of the railroad for the most recent five years preceding the assessment. This average income shall be capitalized by applying to it a capitalization rate which will be computed by using the band of investment method. This method will consider:</p>
                  <p>A. the capital structure of railroads, including capital surplus and retained earnings;</p>
                  <p>B. the cost of debt or interest rate paying particular attention to imbedded debt of railroads;</p>

                  <p>The stock and debt approach to value is the third method which will be used to estimate the unit value of the railroad operating property. This approach to value is based on the accounting principle: assets = liabilities + equity. Therefore, when the value of a company's liabilities (debt) is found and this added to the worth of its stock, a value can be established for its assets (property).</p>
                  <p>The use of this approach to value will be limited to only those railroads meeting qualifications in items A to C:</p>
                  <p>A. The stock of the railroad must be traded on either the New York or American Stock Exchange.</p>
                  <p>B. The bonds of the railroad must be traded or have a rating by either Standard and Poor's or Moody's rating services.</p>
                  <p>C. If the railroad is part of a diversified company, the value of the railroad portion of the total stock price must be able to be separated on an earnings basis using the following method:</p>

                  <p>After the estimated unit value of the railroad property has been determined, the portion of value which is attributable to Minnesota must be established. This is accomplished through the use of certain allocation factors. Each of the factors in the allocation method shows a relationship between the railroad system operations in all states and its Minnesota operations. These relationships are expressed in percentage figures. These percentages are then added and an average is computed. The resulting average of the factors, multiplied by the unit value, yields the Minnesota portion of the railroad property which will, after the adjustments described in parts 8106.0600 and 8106.0800, be subject to ad valorem tax in Minnesota.</p>

                  <p>The factors to be considered in making allocations of unit values to Minnesota for railroad companies are:</p>
                  <p>A. miles of railroad track operated in Minnesota divided by miles of railroad track operated in all states;</p>
                  <p>B. ton miles of revenue freight transported in Minnesota divided by ton miles of revenue freight transported in all states;</p>
                  <p>C. gross revenues from transportation operations within Minnesota divided by gross revenues from transportation operations in all states; and</p>
                  <p>D. cost of road property in Minnesota divided by the cost of road property in all states.</p>

                <p>After the Minnesota portion of the unit value of the railroad company is determined, property which is either exempt from taxation, such as personal property, or classified as nonoperating will be deducted from the Minnesota portion of the unit value to the extent that it has been included in the computation of this value.</p>
                <p>Property which has been included in the computation of the unit value but has been defined as nonoperating property will be valued by the local assessor. The Minnesota portion of the unit value will be reduced by the restated cost of this property. Only nonoperating property located within Minnesota will be eligible for this exclusion.</p>
                <p>The railroad company shall have the responsibility to submit to the commissioner of revenue, in the form required by the commissioner, such schedules of nonoperating property as the commissioner may require.</p>
                <p>In addition to nonoperating property which will be valued and assessed locally, a deduction from the Minnesota portion of the unit value will be made for personal property.</p>
                <p>A percentage of the Minnesota portion of the unit value before deducting nonoperating property will be excluded as personal property. This percentage will be computed in the following way:</p>
                <p>A. The following STB accounts for property within Minnesota will be totaled:</p>

                <p>B. The total of these accounts will then be divided by the total of the Minnesota road, equipment, leased property, general expenditures, construction work in progress, and other elements of investment accounts. The resulting percentage will be used to determine the personal property amount of the Minnesota portion of the unit value. This amount will not be taxable for ad valorem purposes.</p>
                <p>C. The following is an illustration of the computation for the personal property exclusion.</p>

                  <p>After the taxable Minnesota portion of the railroad's unit value has been determined, this value must be distributed to the various counties and taxing districts in which the railroad operates. This distribution will be accomplished by the commissioner of revenue through the use of certain apportionment components. Each of the components in the apportionment method is a reflection of the property owned or used by the railroad within a particular taxing district. The figures making up these components will be developed on information submitted by the railroad companies in annual reports filed with the commissioner, and information supplied to the commissioner by the various county auditors and assessors.</p>

                  <p>The information for the computation of this apportionment component will be based on information submitted by both the railroads and the various county auditors and assessors. The railroad companies shall file with the commissioner of revenue each year, in conjunction with their annual reports required by part 8106.0300, subpart 1, the number of acres of railroad operating land owned or used by them in each taxing district in which they operate. The county auditor shall also be required to submit to the commissioner of revenue a report showing the number of acres of railroad operating land, detailed by owning railroad, in each taxing district within the county. If either the railroads or the auditors find that it is administratively impracticable to submit this information, the commissioner shall make an estimate of the number of acres of railroad operating land within each taxing district based on the best information available. Such information would usually consist of the miles of railroad track within the taxing district and the normal width of the right-of-way used by the railroad. In addition, information relative to the current estimated market value of all land within the respective taxing districts will be obtained from the county or city assessors by a review of the information reported to the commissioner of revenue in compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.85, subdivision 2, clause (4).</p>
                  <p>The computation for the railroad operating land apportionment component will be accomplished annually in the following manner:</p>
                  <p>A. The average estimated market value per taxable acre within a specific taxing district will be calculated by dividing the estimated market value of all taxable land within the taxing district as indicated by the most recent assessment information reported to the commissioner under Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.85, subdivision 2, clause (4). The number of acres within a taxing district will be obtained from the most recent statistics available from the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office, Department of Administration. The total number of acres will be adjusted to allow for nontaxable or exempt acres by subtracting these nontaxable or exempt acres from the total acres. The number of nontaxable or exempt acres will be obtained from the most recent exempt real property information reported to the commissioner under Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.85, subdivision 2, clause (4). The following example illustrates this calculation.</p>

                  <p>C. This railroad operating land component will then be adjusted. This adjustment is achieved by striking a ratio between the system unit value for all Minnesota railroads, as described in part 8106.0400, subpart 5, to the total of net investment in railway property used in transportation service as defined by the STB for all railroads operating in Minnesota. This relationship will be computed annually and will then be applied to the gross railroad operating land component to arrive at the adjusted railroad operating land component. This adjusted land value will then be used as one element of the apportionment computation.</p>

                  <p>The information for the computation of this apportionment component will be based on information submitted by the railroads to the commissioner of revenue in conjunction with the annual report required by part 8106.0300, subpart 1. Each railroad will be required to list the miles of track they own in each taxing district within Minnesota. The track must be separated into two classes, main line track and all other track.</p>
                  <p>In order to make the miles of track in each taxing district compatible with the other apportionment components, the miles must be converted to dollars. This conversion will be computed annually. The conversion will be accomplished by adding together the following STB accounts for each railroad's net investment in Minnesota: account 3, grading; account 8, ties; account 9, rails; account 11, ballast. The total of these accounts will then be divided by the number of miles of track operated by the respective railroads within Minnesota to obtain a cost per mile figure. This will be used as the average cost per mile for track within Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>The following is an example of how the average cost per mile of track in Minnesota will be computed:</p>

                  <p>Total cost of track ($15,250,000) ÷ Total miles operated (610) = Average Cost per Mile of Track $25,000.</p>
                  <p>Main line track shall be weighted at 1.5 times the cost of all other track; thus, if the average cost per mile of track is $25,000, main line track would be worth more than $25,000 per mile, while all other track would be worth less. The calculation for the average cost of both main line and all other track shall be made annually on an industry basis.</p>
                  <p>The calculation to determine the average cost per mile of main line track and the average cost per mile of all other track will be computed in the following manner:</p>
                  <p>A. Total mileage operated will be multiplied by the average cost per mile to arrive at a total track cost.</p>
                  <p>B. Total mileage operated will be separated into the two types of track, main line and all other track.</p>
                  <p>C. Main line track will be multiplied by 1.5 to arrive at adjusted main line miles.</p>
                  <p>D. Adjusted main line miles will be added to all other track miles to arrive at adjusted total track miles.</p>
                  <p>E. Total track cost will be divided by adjusted total track miles to arrive at the cost per mile of all other track.</p>
                  <p>F. The cost per mile of main line track will be computed by multiplying the cost per mile of all other track by 1.5.</p>
                  <p>An illustration of this computation is as follows:</p>

                  <p>The apportionment of a railroad's taxable Minnesota value is accomplished by totaling the amount of the land, track, and structure components as developed in subparts 3 to 5 for each taxing district, then finding the sum of these totals for all the taxing districts in which the subject railroad operates. The taxable Minnesota portion of the railroad's unit value is divided by the total of the three apportionment components for all taxing districts in which the railroad operates in order to arrive at a percentage. This resulting percentage is then applied to the total amount of the three apportionment components for each specific taxing district. The figure produced by this multiplication process is the taxing district's share of the railroad's taxable Minnesota portion of the unit value. No more value can be distributed to the various taxing districts than that produced by the valuation process described in parts 8106.0100 to 8106.0600.</p>
                  <p>The example in part 8106.9900 illustrates the apportionment process.</p>

                  <p>After the apportionment of value referred to in part 8106.0700 has been made, the railroad property values must be equalized to coincide with the assessment levels of commercial and industrial property within each respective county receiving a share of the apportioned railroad value. This equalization will be accomplished through the use of an assessment/sales ratio.</p>

                  <p>A comprehensive assessment/sales ratio study compiled annually by the sales ratio section of the Property Tax Division of the Department of Revenue commonly known as the State Board of Equalization Sales/Ratio Study will be used in this computation. The portions of this study which will be used for purposes of this section are known as the "County Commercial and Industrial Sales Ratio."</p>
                  <p>This commercial and industrial (C &amp; I) sales ratio is computed through an analysis of the certificates of real estate value filed by the buyers or sellers of commercial or industrial property within each county. The information contained on these certificates of real estate value is compiled pursuant to requests, standards, and methods set forth by the Minnesota Department of Revenue acting upon recommendations of the Minnesota legislature. The most recent C &amp; I study available will be used for purposes of this section.</p>
                  <p>The median C &amp; I sales ratio from the County Commercial and Industrial Sales Ratio study will be used as a basis to estimate the current year C &amp; I median ratio for each county.</p>
                  <p>The process used to estimate this current year median ratio will be as follows.</p>
                  <p>The current estimated market value of commercial and industrial property within each county will be taken from the information reported to the commissioner under Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.85, subdivision 2, clause (4). The amount of the value of new commercial and industrial construction, ("new" meaning since the last assessment period) as well as the value of commercial and industrial property which has changed classification (i.e. commercial to tax exempt property) will also be taken from the information reported to the commissioner under Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.85, subdivision 2, clause (4). The value of new construction will then be deducted from the estimated market value, resulting in a net estimated current year market value for commercial and industrial property within the county. The value of commercial and industrial property which has changed classification will be deducted from the previous years estimated market value to arrive at a net estimated previous year market value for commercial and industrial property within the county. The net current year value will be compared to the net previous year's estimated market value for commercial and industrial property within the county and the difference between the two values noted. This difference will be divided by the previous year's net estimated market value for commercial and industrial property to find the percentage of increase, or decrease, in assessment level for each year. This percent of change will be applied to the most recent C &amp; I median ratio to estimate the current year's C &amp; I median ratio. An example of this calculation for a typical county is shown below.</p>

                  <p>This same calculation is performed for each Minnesota county which contains operating railroad property. If there are five or fewer valid sales of commercial and industrial property within a county during the study period, these few sales are insufficient to form the basis for a meaningful C &amp; I ratio. Therefore, the median assessment/sales ratio to be used for purposes of the above computation will not be the median C &amp; I ratio but will be the weighted median ratio of all property classes within the county for which a sales ratio is available. This weighted median ratio is computed in the same manner using the same procedures and standards as the C &amp; I ratio. In addition, the computation described above will not be performed using the commercial and industrial estimated market value but will use the estimated market value for all property within the county. All other aspects of the calculations are identical except for this substitution.</p>
                  <p>The weighted median ratio is developed by multiplying the median ratio for each class of property (agricultural, residential, recreational, commercial) by the percentage of value that class of property comprises of the total county value. An example of this calculation is as follows:</p>

                  <p>After the estimated current year median ratio has been calculated pursuant to subpart 2, it is used to adjust the apportioned estimated market value of operating railroad property to the apparent assessment level of commercial and industrial property in each county. This is done by multiplying the estimated market value of the railroad property by the estimated sales ratio to arrive at the equalized market value of operating railroad property. In no instance will any adjustment be made if, after comparing the estimated current year sales ratio to the assessment level of operating railroad property, the difference between the two is five percent or less. An example of this adjustment is as follows:</p>

                <p>A tax at the rate specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 297F.05, subdivision 3, shall be imposed upon all tobacco products in this state to be paid by any person engaged in business as a distributor. The tax shall be imposed at the time the distributor: brings, or causes to be brought, into this state from without the state tobacco products for sale; makes, manufactures, or fabricates tobacco products in this state for sale in this state; or ships or transports tobacco products to retailers in this state, to be sold by those retailers.</p>
                <p>The liability for the tax accrues at the time of receipt of tobacco products in this state by a distributor. A subsequent transfer from the original distributor to another distributor within this state does not relieve the original distributor from the tax liability. Therefore, no tax credit can be taken on tobacco tax returns for any transfers made within the state.</p>

                  <p>An operator of a facility that weighs waste may allow haulers to elect the method to be used for calculation of the fee on the haulers' vehicles.</p>
                  <p>A hauler making the election is to do so annually, prior to January 1, by notifying the landfill operator of the method for calculation of the fee to be used.</p>
                  <p>Haulers may elect a method to apply to the entire fleet or the election may be done on a vehicle by vehicle basis.</p>
                  <p>All invoices must indicate the method selected for the vehicles identified on the invoice.</p>
                  <p>The commissioner will approve identifiers to be attached to all vehicles which will allow the operator to easily determine the basis for calculation of the fee.</p>
                  <p>If an election is not made by January 1, an operator will calculate the fee based on the same basis as the tipping fee is calculated.</p>
                  <p>On or before February 1 of each year, operators shall submit to the commissioner the list of elections made by all haulers.</p>

                  <p>In addition to the requirements in subpart 1, every operator of a facility shall prepare an invoice, in duplicate, for each individual shipment of solid waste received and accepted at the facility. Each invoice must include the following: the customer's name and address, weight of the waste in pounds if the fee is calculated on weight or volume of the waste in cubic yards, and a means of vehicle identification that will establish the amount of waste delivered to the landfill by each vehicle when a customer operates more than one vehicle for the purpose of hauling and disposing of waste. The duplicate copy of the invoice must be retained at the disposal facility, or otherwise be available from the operator, for not less than 18 months.</p>
                  <p>The amount of the fee charged, if any, must be shown separately on each invoice, except that when a customer receives a periodic billing statement, the statement must separately show the total amount of solid waste fee due, as well as the number of cubic yards or the pound equivalent received at the facility by each vehicle of the customer during the billing period.</p>
                  <p>For customers with multiple vehicles hauling, the operator may modify the above requirement by issuing a statement when the customer is billed.</p>
                  <p>For nonrepetitive single vehicle customers or for loads containing less than three cubic yards, the invoice does not need to show the customer's name and address.</p>
                  <p>If an operator has a flat disposal fee policy for certain vehicles or loads, the state fee assessed is 50 cents for automobiles and $1.50 for pickup trucks, trailers, and other vehicles containing three cubic yards or less.</p>

                  <p>A. A report about internal control structure reportable conditions observed, or evidenced by testing, during the course of an audit, that could affect the organization's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data must be submitted. The report shall elevate a condition to that of a material weakness when the magnitude of the condition is considered material in relation to the financial statements being audited. This report must follow and the department adopts and incorporates by reference the most recent edition of the internal audit standards as provided by audit section 325.11 of the American Institute of Public Accountants - "The Standards of Field Work - Communication of Internal Control Structure Related Matters Noted in an Audit," published June 1, 1994. This incorporation is not subject to frequent change and is available to the public through the Minitex interlibrary loan system. If no reportable conditions or material weaknesses are detected, a report must be submitted stating that no material weaknesses were detected. This report is required under subpart 1.</p>
                  <p>A list of the types of gambling audit reportable condition or material weakness to include in this report follows in subitems (1) to (12). This list is illustrative, and not all-inclusive:</p>
                  <p>(1) absence of appropriate segregation of duties including a detailed explanation;</p>

                  <p>(3) excessive cash shortages or overages;</p>
                  <p>(4) material delinquent taxes due to state or federal taxing authorities;</p>
                  <p>(5) lack of required accounting records maintained;</p>
                  <p>(6) lack of or inaccurate preparation of bank reconciliations or gambling fund reconciliations;</p>
                  <p>(7) material differences between games played and games reported as played;</p>
                  <p>(8) nonuse or inaccurate use of perpetual or physical inventories for all forms of gambling engaged in;</p>
                  <p>(9) lack of specific required identification for tracking and accountability of deposit tickets;</p>
                  <p>(10) material underreporting or overreporting of allowable expenses, lawful purpose expenditures, or board-approved expenditures;</p>
                  <p>(11) failure to properly account for and report fund losses, form LG-250, Fund Loss Report; and</p>
                  <p>(12) inattention to and lack of correction to prior year reportable conditions and material weaknesses.</p>
                  <p>B. A regulatory checklist questionnaire must be included with the report from item A, on a form prescribed by the commissioner. Responses to questions on this checklist must be based on findings and information collected during the course of the audit.</p>

                  <p>The licensed organization shall file with the Department of Revenue a response to the reportable conditions item by item, including any remedial action taken or proposed by the organization. This response may be submitted with the annual audit or review or be filed separately within 60 days after the due date of the annual audit or review. The response must include the following items:</p>
                  <p>A. Any profit carryover variance as shown on the reconciliation of profit carryover supplemental schedule must be identified. All identified variances which require amendments to tax returns must be amended and submitted to the Department of Revenue along with supporting documentation. The auditor must, upon agreement with the organization, assist in preparing an amended return or returns for the organization. The response must indicate if such amendments have been submitted to the Department of Revenue.</p>
                  <p>Variances which require adjustments instead of amendments should be adjusted by sending a letter to the Department of Revenue requesting an adjustment along with supporting documentation. Requests for an approved adjustment cannot be substituted for filing amended tax returns that correct the condition that resulted in the variance. If the variance is identified, an amended tax return or returns must be filed.</p>
                  <p>Unidentified variances must be investigated by the organization and identified. If after investigation an organization is unable to resolve the variance, the organization shall contact the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue will then assist the organization in resolving the variance. Final resolution will be based upon an organization's individual situation and can include: amended tax returns, an approved adjustment, required reimbursement from nongambling sources, or a combination of all three.</p>
                  <p>B. If the comparison of games played to games reported on schedule B, Report of Non-bar Coded Games Played, Destroyed or Lost, or B-2, Report of Bar Coded Games Played, Destroyed or Lost, shows a difference, the organization must respond to the reportable conditions item by identifying and stating if the game difference was due to the games being:</p>
                  <p>(1) missing or lost;</p>
                  <p>(2) destroyed, with state approval;</p>
                  <p>(3) played and unreported; or</p>
                  <p>(4) reported in following month.</p>
                  <p>C. Specific items as noted on the internal control structure report must be responded to.</p>
                  <p>If no response is received from the organization, the organization must submit to the Department of Revenue a copy of the audit management letter upon request.</p>

                  <p>A person who purchases and uses any gasoline or special fuel, on which the Minnesota gasoline or special fuel tax has been paid, for the operation of a power take-off unit (PTO) or auxiliary engine fueled from the same supply tank as the highway vehicle, may obtain a refund of the tax paid on the fuel consumed by the PTO, as calculated under subpart 4 or 5. The taxpayer must file a claim for refund as outlined in subpart 2. Refunds may not be obtained for fuel consumed during idling time.</p>

                  <p>All claims for refund must be submitted on a form PDR-1 or other form as prescribed by the commissioner. Claims must be filed within one year of the date of purchase of the fuel; however, if a claimant chooses to file on an annual basis, whether calendar year or fiscal year, the claim must be received by the commissioner within 60 days of the end of the claimant's accounting year. Claims may be filed as often as monthly. All refund requests must have attached an original sales ticket, bulk fuel invoice, or a signed dealer affidavit. Claimants must maintain records as prescribed under subpart 3.</p>

                  <p>The claimant must maintain the following records:</p>
                  <p>A. The original sales ticket must have a preprinted number, the dealer's name and address, date, number of gallons, type of fuel, price per gallon, a description of the vehicle in which the fuel was placed, the purchaser's (customer's) name and address, the dollar amount of the sale, and the rate of tax or a statement that Minnesota tax is included in the price.</p>
                  <p>B. If bulk fuel is purchased, the customer must keep dispersal records that indicate the date of disbursement, the number of gallons withdrawn, and a description of the vehicle in which the fuel was delivered.</p>
                  <p>C. Fuel logs must be maintained and must be made available to the Department of Revenue upon demand.</p>
                  <p>D. In lieu of original sales tickets, the department will accept alternative records, including computer-generated listings or other electronically generated listings, as long as they clearly provide the necessary information.</p>

                  <p>The percentages in this subpart are allowed for the refund of tax paid on gasoline or special fuel used in operating a PTO or auxiliary engine, when records as outlined in subpart 3 are maintained. The amounts are specified as a percentage of the total taxable fuel used by the vehicle; in other words, the fuel actually placed into the supply tank of the motor vehicle on which the PTO is attached. The refund will be equal to the tax actually paid on that percentage of the fuel.</p>

                  <p>A claimant may choose to forego taking the straight percentage under subpart 4 if accurate records and sufficient documentation are provided to the commissioner to substantiate the refund claim.</p>
                  <p>A. A claim for refund may include alternative information provided from a hubometer (hub meter) or similar device that accurately measures the road use mileage of a vehicle. This information is needed in order to separate the road miles from the PTO miles. The information provided must be sufficient to determine the actual number of miles for which the PTO is engaged while the vehicle is stationary. The refund will then be based on the actual amount of fuel used to run the PTO. This provision is only applicable if the claimant chooses not to take the straight percentage available under subpart 4, and if the claimant provides the commissioner with the documentation needed to substantiate the claim.</p>
                  <p>B. A claimant with a vehicle that contains an on-board computer, which enables the claimant to produce accurate printouts containing detailed information regarding the amount of fuel used to propel the PTO, may submit those printouts to the commissioner with a refund claim. In such a case, the applicable general percentage under subpart 4 will not be used and the computer information shall be used by the commissioner to independently calculate the refund.</p>
                  <p>C. A claimant may use an alternative method, other than those listed in item A or B, to calculate the refund, provided that the claimant furnishes the commissioner with the proposed formula to be used, or other manner of substantiation, and receives written prior approval from the commissioner to use the alternate method.</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (1), provides that a transfer of title constitutes a sale. Title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any condition explicitly agreed upon by the parties. However, no title to goods can pass under a contract for sale prior to identifying such goods as the exact goods to be delivered under the contract. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods. Although the seller retains the legal title to the goods, title passes if the purchaser has the right to the use, possession, and enjoyment of such goods. The following rules apply.</p>
                  <p>A. When the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer, but does not require the seller to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at time and place of shipment.</p>
                  <p>B. When the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes upon tender there.</p>
                  <p>C. Unless otherwise agreed, when the term is "f.o.b." (free on board) the place of shipment, title passes when the seller places the goods in the possession of the designated carrier, or if there is no designated carrier, the seller places the goods in the possession of a common carrier after making a contract for their transportation that is reasonable in view of the circumstances and the nature of the goods.</p>
                  <p>D. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, when delivery is to be made without moving the goods, and the seller is to deliver a document of title, title passes at the time when and where such document was delivered.</p>
                  <p>E. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, when delivery is to be made without moving the goods, and the goods, at the time of contracting, are already identified, and no documents are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</p>

                  <p>A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance, revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a sale. For example, where a customer holds a television set for a few days and thereafter returns it to the retailer, the retailer is not required to report the transaction, as there was no sale.</p>

                  <p>A transaction involving performance of a nontaxable repair service, and incident thereto, a transfer of tangible personal property to the purchaser is not considered a sale for sales and use tax purposes if:</p>
                  <p>A. the value of the property transferred is insignificant as compared to the total consideration; and</p>
                  <p>B. no separate charge is made for such property. In such cases, the service provider is regarded as rendering a nontaxable service. However, if a separate charge is made for the property transferred, a sale within the meaning of the Sales and Use Tax Law is deemed to have occurred.</p>
                  <p>Example. A jeweler uses a spring costing 25 cents to repair a watch. The jeweler bills the customer $6 for repair services. Since the cost of the spring is insignificant in relation to the charge for repair services, no sale of the spring is considered to have been made. The jeweler is required to pay a use tax on the spring if the jeweler did not pay a sales tax at the time of purchase. However, if the jeweler bills separately for the spring, the jeweler must collect a sales tax from the customer.</p>

                  <p>Any item which is taxable if sold is also taxable if leased. If an item is contracted for lease in Minnesota and physical possession of the item by the lessee occurs in Minnesota, a taxable transaction has occurred even if the lessee removes the property from the state for personal use. However, leased property shipped or transported outside Minnesota by the lessee, which will be used in a trade or business outside Minnesota by the lessee without any intermediate use in Minnesota, and which will not be returned to Minnesota except in the course of interstate commerce, is exempt from tax if the lease is not subject to tax in the jurisdiction to which the leased property is transported for use or is used in the other jurisdiction as part of a maintenance contract.</p>
                  <p>All payments made pursuant to leases of tangible personal property, including mobile equipment such as motor vehicles, trailers, and contractor's equipment, constitute sales made in Minnesota if such property is either garaged or principally used, including use thereof in interstate commerce for delivery or other temporary purpose outstate, by the lessee at or from a Minnesota situs of the lessee.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. Motor Freight Line, a Minnesota company, leases ten tractor-trailers from a leasing company. The contract is signed at the Minnesota office of Motor Freight Line, and all payments under the lease are made from this office. Motor Freight Line uses seven of the tractor-trailers to haul freight in interstate commerce to and from its Minnesota freight depot. The remaining three tractor-trailers are used to haul freight in interstate commerce to and from Motor Freight Line's depot in Illinois. From time to time, the three tractor-trailers enter Minnesota in the course of the normal interstate commerce activities of Motor Freight Line. The lease price attributable to the seven tractor-trailers used to haul freight to and from the Minnesota freight depot constitutes a Minnesota sale. The lease price of the remaining three tractor-trailers does not constitute a Minnesota sale.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. Amalgamated Contractors, a Minnesota company, leases a heavy-duty crane for a construction job in Iowa on a monthly basis. The payments are made by Amalgamated to the lessor in Iowa. Subsequently, Amalgamated secures a construction contract in Minnesota and transfers the crane to the Minnesota site. Lease payments due while the crane is located in Minnesota are subject to Minnesota use tax although such payments continue to be made in Iowa.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. Peter Smith, a resident of Fargo, North Dakota, leases a chain saw from XYZ Rental-All, an equipment leasing firm, with an office only in Moorhead, Minnesota. Mr. Smith intends to use the saw at the residence in Fargo, and takes possession of the saw from the rental firm in Minnesota. A Minnesota sales tax is due and payable on this transaction.</p>

                  <p>All lease payments made pursuant to leases executed in Minnesota for drive-it-yourself automobiles, trailers, or other vehicles on a mileage, hourly, or other time basis are taxable, irrespective of whether such vehicles are to be used exclusively in Minnesota or are to be used in other states. Thus, where the lessee delivers the vehicle to the lessor in a state other than Minnesota, either by express agreement with the lessor or without securing prior consent, a lease payment made to the lessor in such other state constitutes consideration for a Minnesota sale.</p>
                  <p>All lease payments made in Minnesota pursuant to leases executed in states other than Minnesota for drive-it-yourself automobiles, trailers, or other vehicles on a mileage, hourly, or other time basis do not constitute consideration paid for a Minnesota sale. Consequently, such payments are not subject to the Minnesota sales and use tax.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. A rental agency, located in Minnesota, leases an automobile to X. Thereafter, X drives the automobile to California and returns the vehicle to the rental agency's office in Los Angeles, and there pays the total lease charge of $280. The lease charge constitutes a sale in Minnesota, and the rental agency is required to include the entire $280 in its gross receipts subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. A rental agency, located in New York, leases an automobile to Y. Thereafter, Y drives the automobile to Minnesota and returns the automobile to the rental agency's office in this state, and there pays the total lease charge of $150. No part of the $150 payment is subject to the Minnesota sales or use tax.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">4</inline>. <b>Services of operator furnished with rentals of equipment.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>For services of an operator furnished with the rental of equipment:</p>
                  <p>A. Certain types of equipment are only available with the services of an operator. For example, the hiring of a taxicab involves the concurrent hiring of a taxicab driver. The same is true with respect to bus companies and commercial airlines. The primary or chief activity of the taxicab company, or the bus line, or the airline, is furnishing transportation services. For all practical purposes, one cannot hire a taxicab or a bus or a commercial airline without accepting the services of a licensed operator. Consequently, the gross receipts from such transactions are not considered sales under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2).</p>
                  <p>B. There are enterprises which lease equipment either with or without operators. For example, a lessor of transport trucks will furnish a driver if the lessee so requests, or a lessor of heavy equipment will furnish an operator for a crane or caterpillar.</p>
                  <p>When a driver or operator is furnished along with the equipment, the lessor, by the lessor's employee or agent, retains control of the equipment. Accordingly, the lessor is considered to be furnishing a nontaxable service rather than leasing the equipment, and the transaction is not considered to be a sale under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2).</p>
                  <p>When a lessor utilizes equipment in furnishing such nontaxable services, no exemption for the purpose of resale is allowed on purchases of such equipment.</p>
                  <p>C. On occasion, an employee may use his or her own pickup truck to transport tools on behalf of the employer from one site to another. If the employee is not engaged in the business of leasing the truck, the transportation of the tools is, in effect, a service performed by the employee at the request of the employer. Any reimbursement to the employee is deemed to be nontaxable.</p>

                  <p>If a lessor, in addition to granting a license to use or right of possession of leased property, contracts to furnish other items or services such as gasoline, oil, lubrication, maintenance (including replacement parts and labor for installation thereof or for the repair of the property in question), license fees, highway use taxes, and insurance, the deductibility of such items will be determined under the following rules.</p>
                  <p>Items deductible from the lease price are gasoline, maintenance labor, public liability insurance, license fees, and highway use taxes. If these items are separately stated by description in the lease agreement and by specific amounts in either the lease agreement, billing, or invoice, they may be deducted in determining the amount of the lease payment subject to tax. If such items are separately stated by description only and without specification of amounts, a percentage of up to one-third of the lease payment may be deducted in determining the amount of the payment subject to tax, provided that the lessor has records that substantiate the accuracy of the percentage used.</p>
                  <p>Where the lease agreement does not specify such items, the entire payment is subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>Items not deductible under any circumstances are oil or lubrication, replacement parts, and collision and comprehensive insurance.</p>

                  <p>For the time of incidence of the tax:</p>
                  <p>A. A lease of tangible personal property is defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 14a. For leases entered into after June 30, 1997, gross receipts generated from the lease are taxable at the rate in effect at the time the obligation to make a lease payment becomes due. The initial obligation to pay becomes fixed upon the transfer of possession of the tangible personal property unless the agreement specifically sets forth another time. Subsequent obligations to pay become fixed either by the terms of the agreement, trade practices of the lessor, or practice in a course of dealing.</p>
                  <p>B. A lease of tangible personal property normally imposes upon the lessee multiple obligations. Each of these obligations may be treated separately by the agreement. The incidence of taxation upon each payment under the agreement will be determined by the obligation for which payment is made and the time at which such obligation to pay in fact arose.</p>

                  <p>When a privilege to possess, use, and enjoy tangible personal property is granted by the owner for a determinate time and on a fixed rental fee basis, or on some other basis that includes a fixed rental fee, and the owner surrenders possession and control under the terms of the agreement to the other party, such arrangement represents a lease. However, where the arrangement contemplates that the owner, for a consideration, will permit the other party to use the property, without the owner divesting physical possession thereof, the arrangement is a "license to use" and is a sale under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2).</p>
                  <p>Example. A lumber dealer sells lumber of only standard dimensions because the majority of customers are building contractors and generally only require lumber in standard sizes. Whenever large lumber orders of nonstandard dimensions are received, the dealer will either cut the lumber and make an additional charge, or allow the contractor to use the sawing equipment on the dealer's premises for $15 per hour. The charges made by the dealer, for the use of sawing equipment by the contractor, represent the granting of "a license to use" and are taxable.</p>

                  <p>As used in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), "consideration in money" refers to the amount of money whether in the form of currency, coins, negotiable instruments, or scrip which the parties agree shall be paid by the purchaser.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. "M," manufacturer, purchases a machine for use in production. "M" pays $5,000 in cash and gives a $20,000, 90-day promissory note drawn to the order of "V," vendor. The note bears interest at six percent. The consideration in money is $25,000. The $20,000 note is still deemed to be "consideration in money" even though "V," holds it until maturity, as "V" may convert the note, plus accrued interest, into cash by negotiation. The accrued interest that may be paid to "V," either at the time of negotiation or at the time of maturity, does not constitute "consideration in money" for sales tax purposes in respect of the sale of the machine.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. Same facts as in example 1, except that "V" discounts the $20,000 promissory note at a bank for $19,500. The consideration paid by "M" is $25,000.</p>
                  <p>Transactions described in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), are sales or purchases where effected by exchange or barter. The terms "exchange" and "barter" are used synonymously. (See part 8130.1500 for exemption for property taken in trade.)</p>

                  <p>Trading stamps which may be redeemed for premiums constitute consideration in the form of scrip. Redemptions by customers of trading stamps for premiums are subject to sales tax unless the premium is exempt by statute, e.g. clothing. The basis of the tax is the fixed value of the trading stamps plus any cash required for the redemption of a particular premium.</p>
                  <p>Trading stamp companies are the users or consumers of trading stamps and similar materials, e.g. booklets, catalogs, etc., and must therefore pay tax on all purchases thereof. Purchases by trading stamp companies of premiums, i.e. merchandise to be exchanged for redeemed trading stamps, are exempt as purchases for resale.</p>
                  <p>The amount charged by a trading stamp company to a dealer for the privilege of distributing trading stamps which are redeemable by the trading stamp company either in cash or premiums is exempt.</p>

                  <p>Whether coupons constitute consideration in the form of scrip is dependent upon the nature of the coupon. Coupons will generally be one of two types:</p>
                  <p>A. coupons which are of such a nature that the retailer does not have recourse to a supplier, distributor, or product manufacturer for reimbursement. These coupons, upon tender to the seller, result in a reduction of the sales price by the seller and are not a part of the consideration paid. The net amount is subject to the tax;</p>
                  <p>B. coupons that are redeemed by the retailer who in turn is reimbursed by a supplier, distributor, or product manufacturer are scrip and a part of the consideration. The value of such coupons is included in the amount subject to the tax. The value of the coupon is equal to the difference between the normal selling price and the reduced selling price of the merchandise.</p>

                  <p>A sales tax is assessed on the retail sale of tangible personal property. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (b).</p>
                  <p>In addition, a sales tax is assessed on the production, fabrication, printing, or processing of tangible personal property for retail consumers who furnish directly or indirectly the materials used in the production, fabrication, printing, or processing. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (c).</p>
                  <p>Producing, fabricating, printing, and processing include any operation which results in the creation or production of tangible personal property, or which is a step in a process or in a series of operations resulting in the creation or production of tangible personal property, except sales for resale.</p>

                  <p>Application of labor to tangible personal property, other than clothing, so that such property may continue to be used in the same form and for the purpose for which acquired represents repairs and does not constitute producing, fabricating, printing, or processing of property. The repair and alteration of clothing, however, is taxable under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (g), clause (6)(i). If the expenditure is made for the purpose of modifying, altering, or assembling it in some other manner, the application of labor to tangible personal property represents a sale under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (c).</p>

                  <p>A. Example 1. A customer enters into an agreement with an upholsterer whereby the latter will remove old fabric from the customer's living room sofa and replace it with fabric chosen by the customer. The cost agreed upon is $300. Service charges are $150, with the remaining $150 representing the cost of the materials. As the reupholstering repair permits the customer to continue to use the sofa for the purpose for which it was acquired, only the $150 for material represents a sale, provided the charges for materials are billed separately, and that such charges represent a reasonable sales price for such material were it purchased without the service charge for reupholstering. If the customer had furnished the material, no sale would have resulted.</p>
                  <p>B. Example 2. A customer furnishes material which is thereafter produced into a slipcover for sofa. The charge for producing the slipcover is a sale in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (c), since it results in the fabrication of tangible personal property. If the customer had purchased material from the upholsterer, the entire cost to the customer would be a sale.</p>
                  <p>C. Example 3. Custom sawing of logs by a saw mill where logs are furnished by the customer constitutes a sale.</p>
                  <p>D. Example 4. Developing prints of home movies or stills for customers who furnish the exposed film constitutes a sale.</p>
                  <p>E. Example 5. Printing on paper stock furnished by customers constitutes a sale.</p>
                  <p>F. Example 6. Reproducing copies of typewritten or printed matter on a stock furnished by customers constitutes a sale.</p>
                  <p>G. Example 7. Recapping of a tire carcass supplied by the customer is a repair. If the materials and labor are separately stated, only the material portion is taxable. If no separation is shown on the invoice, the entire amount is taxable. These rules apply even though the new cap is of a different tread design, i.e. a snow tread cap applied over a summer tread, or vice versa. If a carcass is traded in for a recapped tire, the entire charge, less allowance for the trade-in is taxable. (See part 8130.1500.)</p>
                  <p>H. Example 8. Cutting and milling charges by a lumberyard or woodworking shop, and pipe cutting or threading charges by a hardware store or plumbing shop are taxable whether the materials are supplied by the buyer or the seller.</p>
                  <p>I. Example 9. Engraving of an item furnished by the customer is considered a service not subject to tax. This service engraving is to be differentiated from product engraving which is taxable. Product engraving is billed along with or included in the sales price by the seller at the time the item is sold.</p>
                  <p>J. Example 10. The entire amount charged for the initial electroplating, heat treating, or painting of tangible personal property furnished by the customer is taxable as fabrication labor.</p>
                  <p>K. Example 11. Collating and assembling done by stapling or using a similar process affixing items together is taxable. The punching, assembly, stamping, burning, electroplating, etc. of goods supplied by a customer is taxable.</p>
                  <p>L. Example 12. A locksmith changes a combination on a safe or changes the tumblers in a lock so that a different key must be used. The transaction is considered to be a nontaxable service and the locksmith is required to pay the sales or use tax on purchases of the parts and materials used to perform such service. However, retail sales of keys and parts which are billed separately are taxable.</p>
                  <p>M. Example 13. Additional types of fabrication charges which are taxable regardless of whether the customer or fabricator furnishes the materials include charges for the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) assembling kits to produce a completed article;</p>
                  <p>(2) bending glass tubing into neon signs;</p>
                  <p>(3) bookbinding;</p>
                  <p>(4) conversion of a vehicle into a stretch limousine;</p>
                  <p>(5) drilling holes in bowling balls;</p>
                  <p>(6) engraving when it is charged with or included in the sales price by the retailer;</p>
                  <p>(7) firing of ceramics or china;</p>
                  <p>(8) making of a fur coat from pelts, or gloves or a jacket from a hide;</p>
                  <p>(9) making curtains, drapes, pillows, slipcovers, or other household furnishings;</p>
                  <p>(10) laminating identification cards;</p>
                  <p>(11) lumber cut to specifications and producing cabinets, counter tops, or other items from materials for customers;</p>
                  <p>(12) matting and framing of art work;</p>
                  <p>(13) printing and imprinting, including lithography, silk screen printing, multilithing, mimeographing, photostating, and similar processes;</p>
                  <p>(14) photography, the taking of pictures and developing of films which result in sale of photographs or movies;</p>
                  <p>(15) production of a sound recording or a motion picture;</p>
                  <p>(16) rebuilt auto parts by a manufacturer of a previously manufactured article such as radiators, generators, carburetors, fuel pumps, transmissions, engine blocks, or similar parts;</p>
                  <p>(17) steel fabrication, which may involve cutting the steel to length and size, bending and drilling holes in the steel to the specifications of a particular construction job when the end result of the fabrication is a modification of a previously manufactured article; and</p>
                  <p>(18) taxidermy, the charges for stuffing and mounting.</p>

                  <p>Example 1. "A" purchases four tickets for a professional football game to be played in Wisconsin. The sale of the tickets to A does not constitute a sale because the event is not occurring in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. "A" purchases four tickets from the University of Iowa athletic ticket office for a football game to be played at Minneapolis, Minnesota, between the University of Minnesota and the University of Iowa.

                  <p>The following criteria apply in determining whether a license to use real property for lodging purposes constitutes a sale under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (g), clause (2):</p>
                  <p>A. A lease of or license to use specific real property enforceable for a period of 30 days or more and which requires serving a notice of intention to so terminate either by the lessor or lessee of a period of at least 30 days prior thereto (or such shorter period as agreed to by the parties for violation of the lease conditions) does not constitute a sale even though the rent may be paid on a weekly or semimonthly basis.</p>
                  <p>B. A lease of or a license to use real property if the consideration for the lease or license is paid or payable at periods of less than 30 days' duration, or if the parties are not bound by an enforceable written contract to give prior notice of 30 days or more of intention to terminate, constitutes a sale.</p>
                  <p>C. A person engaged in the furnishing of taxable lodging facilities, in determining the amount of consideration received subject to the tax, shall include separately stated charges for telecommunication service and amounts received for the use of a television set or other items of tangible personal property.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. "G," guest, registers at hotel without entering into an enforceable written agreement whereby G will occupy a room for a period in excess of 30 days. G stays at the hotel for five full weeks. Thereafter, G settles the account and vacates the room. Although occupancy was in excess of the statutory period of 30 days, the transaction constitutes a sale in accordance with item B.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. Hotel, in addition to furnishing sleeping accommodations and related service to transients, leases rooms or suites to ten persons on a monthly basis. "G," guest, occupies a small suite, and pays in advance on the first day of each month. The leasing of a suite to G does not constitute a sale, as a hotel also may be a lodging house, and G, who is a tenant at will, is required to give notice of termination of at least 30 days.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. "T," tenant, rents an apartment from Landlord without a lease. T pays rent weekly. Each of the parties is required to give notice of one week of intention to terminate. Consequently, this arrangement constitutes a sale, as the leasing of the premises to T is for a period of less than 30 days.</p>
                  <p>Example 4. Motel charges guest $50 per day for a room. "G," guest, makes three local telephone calls. Motel bills G for $50 plus a separately stated charge of $1.50 for telephone calls, and $5 for use of video games. The taxable consideration paid by G is $56.50 represented by the $50 charge for the room, $5 charge for the video games, and $1.50 for telephone calls.</p>
                  <p>Example 5. If "X" company leases a room in a hotel or motel on a yearly basis for occasional use by employees or guests, the charge is exempt even if a particular room is not reserved for the exclusive use of X company.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">2</inline>. <b>Definitions.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The definitions in items A to F apply to this part.</p>
                  <p>A. "Billing month," for natural gas or electricity, means the month the bill is dated regardless of when the service was rendered. Billing month means the meter reading date if there is no date on the bill. If a utility uses a system of cycle billing and 12 revenue months per year, the billing month may be the utility's revenue month.</p>
                  <p>B. "Heating season" means the billing months of November, December, January, February, March, and April.</p>
                  <p>C. "Interruptible service credit" means a credit given by a utility company to a customer each month in exchange for the customer's agreement to shut down certain equipment during periods of high power usage.</p>
                  <p>D. "Primary source of residential heat" means the source which heats the largest square footage of floor space. When a user heats the same area with two sources of heat, each using different fuels, such as a home heated by wood which also has an electric heating system, then the primary source of residential heat is the source which supplies more heat than any other source for the largest period of time during the heating season. The examples in subitems (1) to (3) illustrate this situation.</p>
                  <p>(1) "B" heats a home with natural gas. "B" adds an addition to the home, which is heated with electricity. The largest square footage of the floor space is heated with gas. Since only the fuel which provides the primary source of heat for the entire residence qualifies for the exemption, both fuels cannot be exempt. Here, the electricity is taxable and the natural gas is exempt because the primary source of heat for the entire residence is natural gas.</p>
                  <p>(2) "B" heats a home with natural gas. "B" adds an addition to the home, which is heated with electricity. The square footage of the part of the home that is heated with natural gas is equal to the square footage of the addition that is heated with electricity. Although neither is the primary source of heat, in this situation "B" may choose one source of heat to be considered the primary source.</p>
                  <p>(3) "B" uses fuel oil to heat a home, but uses electricity to provide additional heat in the basement. The fuel oil would be exempt as all fuel oil delivered to a home is exempt. The electricity would be taxable since electricity is not the primary source of heat for the residence.</p>
                  <p>E. "Residential use" means use for general household purposes including cooking and water heating. Residential use does not include use in travel trailers, motor homes, or other recreational vehicles.</p>
                  <p>F. "Residential users" or "residential customers" includes persons billed for sales of residential heating fuel for single-family homes, duplexes, townhouse units, condominium units or buildings, apartment units or buildings, nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, mobile homes, fraternity or sorority houses, rooming houses, seasonal cabins, group homes, city and county jails, and state-operated correctional facilities and regional treatment centers.</p>

                  <p>The following are exempt from sales and use tax:</p>
                  <p>A. Fuels, electricity, gas, steam, or water that is used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production of personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail. See part 8130.5500 and Minnesota Statutes, sections 297A.68, subdivision 2, and 297A.69, subdivision 2.</p>
                  <p>B. Fuel, electricity, gas, and steam stored, used, or consumed in the production of a taxable service intended to be sold ultimately at retail. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 3.</p>
                  <p>C. For the billing months of the heating season, natural gas or electricity sold for residential use to customers who are metered and billed as residential users and who use natural gas or electricity for their primary source of residential heat. When gas or electricity is exempt as a heating fuel, all other gas or electricity used through the same meter is also exempt for the six-month heating season. Each qualifying customer must receive six months of service exempt from taxation. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 15. See subpart 7 for tax treatment of residential customers on utility budget plans.</p>
                  <p>D. On a year-round basis, all fuel oil, coal, wood, steam, hot water, propane gas, and LP gas sold to residential customers for residential use. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 15. See subpart 7.</p>
                  <p>E. Water services for residential use are exempt regardless of how the services are billed. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 16.</p>

                  <p>All charges associated with furnishing utilities or making utility service available, except fees for the safe drinking water testing program mandated by federal law and taxes legally imposed directly on the consumer that are separately stated on the bill given to the purchaser, are considered part of the sales price and are subject to tax. If the utility service being provided is exempt from tax, the additional charges are also exempt. If the utility service being provided is partially exempt from tax, the additional charges will be exempt to the same extent the utility service is exempt. The following are examples of taxable charges that are included in the base on which the sales tax is charged. These charges are taxable even if minimal or no services are consumed:</p>
                  <p>A. demand charge;</p>
                  <p>B. fixed or basic monthly charge;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">5</inline>. <b>Credits determined before and after the sale.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Credits or dividends, such as capital contribution credits, interruptible service credits, and patronage dividends, are not included in the amount subject to sales tax if the credit and the amount of the credit are determined prior to the sale. These credits are included in the amount subject to sales tax if the credit or the amount of the credit is determined by events that happen after the sale has occurred. The examples in items A to C illustrate these situations.</p>
                  <p>A. An electric company and a manufacturer enter into an interruptible service agreement. Under this agreement, the manufacturer agrees to shut down certain machinery during peak electricity demand periods. In exchange, the electric company gives the customer a credit on each bill. This credit is a constant dollar amount and is based on the amount of kilowatts the manufacturer would conserve by shutting down the agreed upon machinery. The credit is given regardless of whether the manufacturer was required to shut down machinery during the period. Here, the credit is contracted for before the sale and must be subtracted from the sales price before sales tax is calculated.</p>
                  <p>B. A utility company and a manufacturer enter into an interruptible service agreement. Under this agreement, the manufacturer agrees to allow the utility company to control its water heaters during peak kilowatt demand periods and must use 500 kilowatts during the period. In exchange, the utility company gives the manufacturer an $8 rebate each month. If 500 kilowatts are not used during the period, no rebate is given. The rebate can only be used as a credit against the next bill, and if service is not continued the credit is forfeited. In this case, whether a credit will be allowed is not determined until after the sale occurs. Therefore, the amount of the credit must be included in the sales price when calculating the amount of sales tax due.</p>
                  <p>C. The rate a utility cooperative charges its patrons includes a capital contribution in addition to the cost of providing services. The bylaws of the cooperative require that the excess of its revenue over its operating costs and other expenses are capital contributions paid by its patrons. At the end of each year, the amount of each patron's contribution is determined and credited to the patron's capital account. In this case, it is not determined until after the sale has occurred if a credit will be allowed, and if so, how much the credit will be. Therefore, the amount of the credit must be included in the sales price when calculating the amount of sales tax due.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">6</inline>. <b>Commercial and residential use.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. If a building houses both residential quarters and commercial operations and contains one meter for the entire building for either water, electricity, or natural gas, the water, electricity, or natural gas supplied will be considered to be for residential use if less than 50 percent of the square footage of the building is used for commercial operations. If 50 percent or more of the building is used for commercial operations, the utility service will be considered to be for commercial use.</p>
                  <p>B. If a building which houses both residential quarters and commercial operations contains one central heating plant for the entire building, heating fuels supplied to or for the heating plant will be considered to be used for residential use if less than 50 percent of the square footage of the building is used for commercial operations. If 50 percent or more of the building is used for commercial operations, the heating fuels will be considered to be for commercial use.</p>
                  <p>C. Examples of a residence that is also used as a commercial property:</p>
                  <p>(1) "B" owns a building with a restaurant on the first floor. "B" lives in an apartment on the second floor. There is one central heating plant for the entire building, and the primary source of heat is natural gas. The basement is not used as part of the commercial operation. Since less than 50 percent of the square footage is used for commercial purposes, the exemption applies.</p>
                  <p>(2) "C" owns and operates a resort. "C" has a home and four cabins which are heated by LP gas from one LP gas tank. The four cabins constitute a commercial business activity. There is only one common source of heat. The fuel supply to the common heating plant is not regarded as used for residential use if the square footage of the four cabins exceeds that of the home. In determining the square footage of commercial use, the seasonal use must also be considered. Assume "C" has a 1,600 square foot home and four rental units of 750 square feet each that are available for rent six months of the year. In computing the square footage for commercial use, 4 x (1/2 of 750) or 1,500 is for commercial use; and as 1,600 square feet is for residential use, the heating fuel is exempt.</p>
                  <p>(3) "D" is a dentist who has a dental office in the home. "D's" home is heated with fuel oil. The fuel is exempt if the office occupies less than 50 percent of the square footage of the home.</p>
                  <p>(4) "B" owns a resort and uses LP gas to heat "B's" residence and five rental units from the same tank. At the end of the season, the rental units are closed down and only "B's" residence consumes LP gas. The rental units that are not operational during the winter must be included when determining if the customer is a residential user, but the seasonal use of the rental units is considered in determining if the commercial use equals or exceeds 50 percent. See subitem (2).</p>
                  <p>(5) "C" owns a resort and rents out cabins on a weekly basis during the summer months. During the months of September through May, the cabins are rented as rental units on a monthly basis. The cabins are heated by propane fuel from one storage tank. Fuel used to heat the cabins rented on a monthly basis from September through May is exempt as residential heating fuel. However, fuel used during the summer months to operate cabins rented weekly is taxable. "C" may purchase the fuel exempt for residential heating, but must pay use tax on fuel during the summer months.</p>
                  <p>(6) "D" owns an apartment building that is heated with electricity. "D" is responsible for heating the entire building including all common areas. The residential heating fuel exemption would apply in this case. Apartment buildings and condominium units are considered to be residential. Therefore, sales of electricity used as a primary source of heat to owners of these buildings are exempt during the heating season. This is true even when the electricity is used by the building owner to heat common areas such as hallways and laundry rooms.</p>
                  <p>D. When a building houses both residential quarters and commercial operations, a utility's acceptance of a fully completed exemption certificate claiming the residential heating fuel exemption will relieve the utility from liability for the tax if it is later determined that the exemption was improperly claimed. The utility must exercise reasonable care and judgment before allowing the customer to use the exemption for the utility to be relieved of liability under this item.</p>

                  <p>A. All fuel oil, coal, wood, steam, hot water, propane gas, and LP gas delivered to a residence is assumed to be used for residential heating and is exempt. All fuel oil, coal, wood, steam, hot water, propane gas, and LP gas that is not delivered to a residence is taxable. Heating fuels picked up by a customer are taxable unless the customer provides the retailer with a written statement indicating that the heating fuel is for residential heating purposes.</p>
                  <p>B. Sales of firewood are exempt as residential heating fuel whether delivered or picked up by the customer. Sales of firewood for recreational use, including camping and picnics, are taxable.</p>
                  <p>C. Sales of artificial fireplace logs are not exempt home heating fuel and are taxable.</p>
                  <p>D. Fuel used to heat fish houses is taxable since fish houses are not regarded as residences.</p>
                  <p>E. The monthly payments of residential customers on budget plans with a local utility will not change during the heating season. Sales tax is paid by the utility on actual consumption, not the monthly payments. Therefore, while residential customers will not pay sales tax on their heating fuel during the heating season, their monthly payments will remain the same.</p>

                  <p>Effective June 1, 1992, items A and B apply when a local government sells utility services to other departments or divisions within the same unit of local government.</p>
                  <p>A. A utility that is operated by a local government as a separate corporation is considered a separate legal entity or person. Therefore, the sale of utility services by this entity to other departments within the local government are taxable sales.</p>
                  <p>B. A utility that is operated by a local government, but that is not separately incorporated, should not charge sales tax on sales of utility services to other departments or within the same unit of local government. The transfer is merely a book transfer within one entity and no taxable sale has occurred.</p>

                  <p>Under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 4, paragraph (d), sales of building materials, supplies, and equipment to owners, contractors, subcontractors, or builders constitute retail sales and are thus taxable.</p>
                  <p>A. The term "building materials, supplies, and equipment," as used in these rules, refers to property intended to become part of a new building, structure, road or an addition, repair, improvement, or alteration to roads or real estate. A partial list of such materials includes gravel, blacktop, bricks, cement, steel beams and rods, electrical supplies, glass, woodwork, paint and paint supplies, pipes and valves, aluminum sheathing, wood and composition sheathing, lumber, plastics, roofing, and wallboards. Other property usually incorporated into a building or other types of real property includes lighting fixtures, plumbing and bathroom fixtures, furnaces, boilers and heating units for space heating, prefabricated cabinets, and central air conditioning units (for space cooling).</p>
                  <p>B. The term "real property" includes structures that are permanently affixed to real estate, such as buildings, fixtures, machinery, fences, railroad tracks, grain elevators, bridges, storage bins, silos, outdoor advertising signs, and billboards.</p>
                  <p>C. Other types of equipment may be incorporated into a new structure or added to an existing structure undergoing repairs, alterations, or improvements in order to enhance the attractiveness of the structure or to increase its rental or sales value. Examples of such equipment are built-in dishwashers, stoves and ranges, garbage disposal units, and air-conditioners installed in openings in outer walls.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">2</inline>. <b>Contractors and construction activities.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Contractors are generally classified into two broad groups: general contractors and subcontractors.</p>
                  <p>A. A "general contractor" is a person who contracts to furnish the necessary materials and labor for the performance of a construction contract, and generally is one who contracts to build the entire project or a major portion thereof, or who contracts to install special building equipment, or who repairs or remodels a limited area in a structure at a price that includes machinery, equipment, and installation charges. The person for whom the general contractor performs the work is generally the owner.</p>
                  <p>B. A "subcontractor" is a person who contracts to furnish the necessary materials and labor for the completion of a portion of the general construction contract at the job site. The subcontractor ordinarily contracts with the general contractor to perform a certain part of the work which the general contractor has undertaken to perform under the general construction contract.</p>
                  <p>C. The terms "contractor" and "subcontractor" are not applicable to persons who merely sell tangible personal property in the form of building materials, supplies, or equipment to construction contractors, for delivery at the job site without any requirement that they install such tangible personal property.</p>
                  <p>D. The term "construction contract" as used herein refers to a contract under the terms of which a contractor agrees to perform construction activities resulting in an alteration, repair, or improvement of real property. Where machinery or equipment is attached to real property in such a manner and with the intent that it becomes a nontemporary accession to the real property, the contract pursuant to which it is attached shall be regarded as a "construction contract." Any attachment of property by or for a lessor thereof to realty not owned by the lessor where the lessor retains title and ownership of the property shall be considered a temporary accession to the real property and such property therefore retains its character as tangible personal property.</p>
                  <p>The term "construction contract" shall not include any contract for a sale of machinery or equipment which the seller, pursuant to the contract, will attach to or install upon real property if:</p>
                  <p>(1) the machinery or equipment is of such size and installed in such a manner that it retains its character as personal property; or</p>
                  <p>(2) the purchaser is not the owner of the real property to which the property will be attached, and the machinery or equipment can be removed without material injury to the realty; or</p>
                  <p>(3) the title to the machinery or equipment passes from the seller to the purchaser prior to attachment to or installation on the real property.</p>
                  <p>E. Such construction activities do not include the sale and installation of an appliance, machinery, equipment, or other item of tangible personal property in such a manner as not to become a permanent part of the real estate. Computers shall be considered to retain their classification and identification as personal property when installed because of such factors as industry standards, custom and practice, usage, and uniqueness. Where a fixed price or lump sum construction contract provides for the incidental transfer of certain tangible personal property and the contractor sells such items only as a part of the construction project, the contractor is not regarded as a retailer provided that such personal property comprises an insubstantial portion of the total contract price.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. A dealer agrees to replace the old refrigerators with new models in a four-unit dwelling. The sale and installation of the refrigerators does not constitute a construction contract. The transaction represents a sale at retail to the owner of the four-unit dwelling.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. A computer manufacturer sells and leases computers and also installs them on the customer's property. The sale or lease of a computer, regardless of size, is a sale or lease of tangible personal property and the installation does not constitute a construction contract.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. A leasing company purchases a piece of equipment from company A and leases it to company B. Company A installs the equipment on the property of company B. The sale and installation of the equipment does not constitute a construction contract, since the owner of the equipment is not the same as the owner of the property to which the equipment was installed. The equipment is considered to be tangible personal property and the leasing company purchases the property exempt for resale and collects the sales tax on the lease payments from company B.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">3</inline>. <b>Construction contracts with exempt entities.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>For construction contracts with exempt entities:</p>
                  <p>A. The exemption from the tax on the sale of tangible personal property to the United States, as well as to corporations and other institutions exempt under Minnesota Statutes, sections 297A.67 to 297A.71, does not extend to building materials, supplies, and equipment purchased by a contractor under an agreement to erect a building or to alter, repair, or improve real estate for such exempt entity unless the sale is specifically exempted under section 297A.71. However, purchases of such building materials, supplies, and equipment by exempt entities are exempt from the sales and use tax.</p>
                  <p>Example. A school district enters into a contract with a contractor for school construction. The contractor purchases materials for this job from various suppliers. The construction is clearly an alteration or improvement to real property with material purchased by the contractor for use in constructing the school. These transactions constitute retail sales and are subject to the sales tax. Had the school district purchased the materials directly, the purchase of the materials by the school district would have been exempt.</p>
                  <p>B. If an exempt entity has entered into a fixed price construction contract which covers the complete structure including the materials, and the exempt entity furnishes some or all of the materials to the contractor for a credit against the contract price, a taxable sale occurs when the exempt entity transfers the materials to the contractor.</p>
                  <p>Example. A school district enters into a contract with a contractor for the construction of a school building. The contractor not only specified the price at which the contractor agreed to deliver the completed school, but made known to the school district the portion of the total cost of construction allocated to building materials and supplies. In addition, the contractor furnished the school district with the names of the several suppliers and the descriptions and price of each item or items furnished by each of such suppliers. Thereafter, the school district purchased the specified items at the price furnished by the contractor and made payments from its own funds to the suppliers. The material and supplies so purchased were thereafter delivered to the contractor and, in return, the school district received credit against the contract price for the payments made by it.</p>
                  <p>Although the initial purchase of the material and supplies by the school district is exempt, the transfer to the contractor is a transfer of title or possession and taxable as such for the following reason: the contractor has agreed to deliver a completed structure which necessarily includes the materials; during construction of the building the materials will be in the possession of the contractor, who bears the risk of any loss of such materials during construction; and a portion of the contract price is correspondingly reduced by the cost of the materials paid to the supplier by the school district.</p>
                  <p>C. The transfer of building materials by an exempt entity to its contractor for use in connection with a contract for the erection, alteration, repair, or improvement of realty is not deemed a retail sale (and is thus exempt from the sales or use tax) provided:</p>
                  <p>(1) the contract is for labor only;</p>
                  <p>(2) all incidents of ownership to the building materials remain in the exempt entity at all times;</p>
                  <p>(3) the contractor bears no responsibility for inherent defects in the building materials; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the contractor bears no risk of loss of any of the building materials.</p>
                  <p>D. An exempt entity, in addition to contracting with a contractor for the erection of a building or the alteration or repair of real estate, may appoint and designate the contractor as purchasing agent for such exempt entity in connection with the construction contract. In such situations the department will recognize the agency relationship asserted only if the written contract clearly sets forth:</p>
                  <p>(1) that such appointment has been made;</p>
                  <p>(2) that title to all materials and supplies purchased pursuant to such appointment shall immediately vest in the owner or principal at point of delivery;</p>
                  <p>(3) that the risk of loss with respect to such materials and supplies is that of the owner or principal; and</p>
                  <p>(4) that the owner or principal, and not the agent, shall have responsibility for all defective materials and supplies, including those incorporated into realty purchased in such manner.</p>
                  <p>In the event that the contract in question does not specify as to risk of loss, other competent evidence, such as insurance coverage, will suffice.</p>
                  <p>Any contractor who has been appointed agent for the purchase of materials and supplies, as specified above, shall furnish adequate notification to all vendors and suppliers of such agency relationship and shall make it clear to such vendors that the obligation for payment is that of the owner and not the contractor-agent. All purchase orders and other documents furnished to the vendor shall clearly reflect the agency relationship.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">4</inline>. <b>Contractor-retailer.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A "contractor-retailer" is a person using building materials, supplies, and equipment in the performance of construction contracts, and in addition, is engaged in making retail sales of building materials, supplies, and equipment.</p>
                  <p>A. A sale by a contractor-retailer of building supplies, materials, and equipment which sales does not provide for installation of the merchandise sold is a sales at retail.</p>
                  <p>B. A sale by a contractor-retailer of building supplies, materials, and equipment which sale provides for installation of the merchandise is a construction contract and tax shall be paid by the contractor-retailer based upon the cost of materials. Two separate contracts executed contemporaneously by a contractor-retailer providing individually for the sale and installation of building materials, supplies, and equipment shall be considered to be a single unified construction contract if that was the intent of the parties as evidenced by their actions. A contractor-retailer who enters into a construction contract with an exempt entity shall pay tax based upon the cost of materials.</p>
                  <p>C. A contractor-retailer sells property under both of the following two circumstances.</p>
                  <p>(1) When certain property is sold without providing for installation, the sale constitutes a sale at retail. For example, the sale by a plumbing contractor of a water heater without installation is a sale at retail.</p>
                  <p>(2) When a contractor-retailer sells certain property either installed or without installation, at the purchasers' option, and such property is sold with installation which causes it to become incorporated as a part of the realty, that sale shall be regarded as a construction contract and tax shall be paid by the contractor-retailer upon the cost of materials. For the purposes of such a transaction, retailer is deemed to be contractor and the purchase of the supplies and equipment used in installing the property constitutes a retail sale to the contractor.</p>
                  <p>D. Persons primarily engaged in the making of retail sales of building materials, supplies, and equipment used in construction, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property, and who are also engaged as contractors in building, altering, repairing, or improving real property, shall report and pay their sales or use tax liability in accordance with the following.</p>
                  <p>(1) If at the time such person makes a purchase of specific items and knows of the use to which such items are to be put, the person shall either:</p>
                  <p>(a) furnish an exemption certificate if such items are being acquired for the purpose of resale; or</p>
                  <p>(b) pay the sales tax to the seller if the items in question are to be used by such person in the construction, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property.</p>
                  <p>(2) If at the time such person makes a purchase of certain items but does not know the precise utilization of such items, and if business activities during the prior calendar year reflect that 50 percent or less of such purchases were sold at retail, then the person shall pay the sales tax to the supplier on all such purchases. If the person later sells any of such items at retail, he or she may take a proper deduction on the sales and use tax return.</p>
                  <p>(3) If the person's business activities during the prior calendar year reflect that more than 50 percent of such purchases were sold at retail, he or she may use a fully completed resale exemption certificate for the purchase of all such items.</p>
                  <p>E. The accounting records of a contractor-retailer must clearly reflect the use made of items purchased for both the preceding and current calendar year. These records must be in such form that the commissioner may determine readily that the proper sales and use tax liability is being reported and paid.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. In March, a contractor-retailer purchased ten bathtubs at $150 each and 20 bathroom sinks at $40 each. As primarily a contractor, the contractor-retailer paid the sales tax due. During this same month, the contractor-retailer sold at retail two bathtubs at $200 each and five bathroom sinks at $55 each. The contractor-retailer reports gross receipts from retail sales of $675. The sales tax due and owing from the contractor-retailer is $43.88 (6.5 percent of $675). Since the contractor-retailer is entitled to offset the tax paid on the property sold at retail, the following calculation is made for the sales and use tax reported for the month of March:</p>

Being primarily a retailer, the contractor-retailer paid no tax at time of purchase, but gave the supplier an exemption certificate. Thereafter, in March, the contractor-retailer sold at retail two bathtubs at $200 each and five bathroom sinks at $55 each. In addition, the contractor-retailer utilized three bathtubs and six bathroom sinks in contracting activities.

                <p>Any amount allowed as a credit against the sales price for tangible personal property taken in trade for resale is exempt under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 26. The payoff of the old contract does not affect the amount allowed on the trade-in; even if this indebtedness is included in the new contract. The property so accepted qualifies for the exemption if the property is taxable under the Sales and Use Tax Law or the Sales Tax on Motor Vehicles Law.</p>
                <p>Example 1. A dealer sells a new boat with a list price of $3,000 to a customer. The dealer accepts the customer's used boat in trade and gives the customer a credit of $1,000. The credit qualifies for the exemption. Consequently, the sales price is $2,000.</p>
                <p>Example 2. A mobile home dealer sells a customer a new mobile home with a list price of $12,000. The customer trades in an old mobile home which has an existing loan of $2,000 on it. The dealer agrees to include the payoff amount of the old contract in the new contract. The dealer allows $5,000 for the trade-in of the customer's mobile home. The following represents the amount of financing the customer arranges for and the sales price is $7,000:</p>

                  <p>Where taxable property is returned, the retailer's reported gross receipts may be reduced in the month the property is returned by the amount of the sales price refunded, provided that the applicable sales tax has also been refunded. If the credit given or the cash refunded for the returned merchandise is reduced by a handling charge, the entire amount of sales tax collected should be refunded and a reduction of gross sales for the full sales price should be taken on the sales and use tax return. Where a purchaser of taxable property makes a gift of such property, and subsequently the recipient of the gift returns the property to the vendor and requests a refund of the amount paid for the property, the recipient is entitled to a refund of the sales tax applicable to the amount of the sales price that is refunded. Repossession of tangible personal property does not constitute a return of property. Merchandise that was sold on approval and later returned may be deducted from gross receipts.</p>
                  <p>Adjustments to the sales price because of unknown damage at the time of sale, i.e. scratches, dents, etc., but not detected until a later time, may be deducted from gross receipts.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. A hardware dealer sells a customer a lawnmower for $100. The customer pays $100 plus sales tax. As the lawnmower was defective, it was returned to the hardware dealer, and the total price including sales tax paid was refunded to the customer. Gross receipts will be reduced by $100.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. Retail Tires sells four new tires to a customer at $40 each under guarantee in June. In August, the customer returns one tire and is given a cash refund of $30 plus tax. Retail Tires may reduce gross sales by the $30 refunded on the August sales and use tax return.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. A purchases taxable personal property from a retailer at a price of $100 plus sales tax. A then makes a gift of the property to B. B returns the property to the retailer and requests a refund of the amount paid for the property. B (the donee of the gift) is entitled to a refund of the $100 sales price plus sales tax. The retailer may reduce gross sales by $100 on the sales tax return for merchandise returned and thereby receive credit for the amount of refundment.</p>
                  <p>Example 4. A lumber company sells 20 redwood posts to a customer for $100 plus sales tax. The customer decides not to use the posts and returns them to the lumber company. The lumber company has a policy of refunding all but $10 on all returned merchandise. This $10 represents a handling fee for placing the merchandise back into stock. The lumber company is required to refund the customer the entire sales tax and claim a reduction of $100 in gross sales on its sales and use tax return.</p>

                  <p>The sales tax is imposed upon the gross receipts from retail sales. "Gross receipts" are defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 8, as the total amount received, in money or by barter or exchange, for all retail sales (see Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 4) as measured by the sales price. (See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 7.)</p>
                  <p>The person filing the return may report gross receipts either:</p>
                  <p>A. on the cash basis as the consideration is received; or</p>
                  <p>B. on the accrual basis as sales are made.</p>
                  <p>An election is deemed to have been made to report gross receipts under the method of accounting on the basis of which the person filing the return regularly computes income for tax purposes, unless he or she can demonstrate to the commissioner that a method of accounting for gross receipts subject to the sales tax (which differs from the method of accounting employed for other purposes) will not prevent or make difficult an orderly and systematic audit of the records by the commissioner. An application shall be made to the commissioner for permission to change the method of reporting.</p>

                  <p>Where there is a change in ownership or name, the following rules are applicable:</p>
                  <p>A. Sale of a business enterprise operated as a sole proprietorship requires a new application, although the business may be continued under the same name.</p>
                  <p>B. Admission of a new partner to a partnership requires a new application, even if the business is continued under the same name. Resignation, expulsion, or death of a partner requires a new application if the partnership is required to obtain a new federal identification number because of the resignation, expulsion, or death.</p>
                  <p>C. A change in the ownership of shares of stock of a corporation does not invalidate a permit issued to the corporation, as there has been no shifting of the liability for payment of sales and use tax.</p>
                  <p>D. A change in name of a business enterprise or a change in location, where there has been no change in ownership, means the permit holder must notify the department of the changed name or address.</p>
                  <p>E. In the event of the death of a permit holder who was operating a business as a sole proprietor, the duly appointed and qualified estate representative of the decedent's estate can assume and use the decedent's Minnesota sales and use tax account number during the period of probate administration. However, if the decedent's business is sold or ownership is assumed by a member of the decedent's family, a change of ownership occurs and a new Minnesota sales and use tax permit is required.</p>

                  <p>he commissioner may reinstate a revoked sales and use tax permit, or issue a new permit to a taxpayer whose permit had been revoked if the taxpayer:</p>

                  <p>B. pays with a certified check, cashier's check, or money order the entire balance of tax, penalty, and interest due;</p>
                  <p>C. deposits with the commissioner, security or a surety bond in an amount equal to three times the average liability for the period for which returns are required to be filed, or six times the average liability in the case of a taxpayer who has had another permit revoked within the preceding 24 months;</p>
                  <p>D. signs an agreement to file timely returns and remit tax when due in the future. The agreement will specify an individual to whom or location where the returns and payments must be sent. All payments must be made by certified check, cashier's check, or money order, or by electronic funds transfer in the case of a taxpayer who has had another permit revoked within the preceding 24 months; and</p>
                  <p>E. has sales and use tax returns prepared by an attorney, accountant, agent, or preparer or attends a business education class for sales tax given by the department, if the taxpayer has had another permit revoked within the preceding 24 months.</p>

                  <p>Each failure to file a return or pay a tax due during the two-year period extends such period for the duration of the taxable period for which the return has not been filed or the tax has not been paid.</p>
                  <p>The commissioner will pay interest on any money deposited as security. The interest will be calculated from the date of deposit to the date of refund, or date of application to any outstanding tax liability, at a rate specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.405. The security deposit will be refunded to the taxpayer at the end of the two-year period, plus any extensions for violations, unless the taxpayer has any unpaid tax liabilities. The commissioner may apply the security deposit to any unpaid tax liabilities. The commissioner may refund the security deposit to the taxpayer before the end of the two-year holding period (or extended holding period) if the taxpayer's business ceases to operate and the taxpayer is no longer required to file sales and use tax returns and pay sales and use tax.</p>

                  <p>A. A taxpayer must submit an application to the commissioner in order to obtain an exemption authorization to be used on the certificate of exemption for the following exemptions or situations:</p>
                  <p>(1) waste processing equipment used at a resource recovery facility under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 24;</p>
                  <p>(2) direct payment of sales or use tax under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.89;</p>
                  <p>(3) direct payment of tax by interstate for hire motor carriers under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.90; and</p>
                  <p>(4) purchases of tangible personal property or services by a charitable organization.</p>
                  <p>B. A taxpayer does not need to submit an application to the commissioner in order to obtain an exemption authorization when the certificate of exemption is used for other exemptions.</p>
                  <p>C. Exemption certificates may be used for single purchases or for continuing future purchases. When used for continuing future purchases, the certificate is referred to as a blanket exemption certificate. Whether a certificate is a single purchase or blanket certificate is determined by marking the appropriate blank provided on the form.</p>

                  <p>Under Minnesota Statutes, sections 297A.665 and 297A.72, the seller may accept an exemption certificate from the purchaser on items otherwise taxable. Under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.73, if the purchaser makes a nonexempt use of the property for which the purchaser had given an exemption certificate, that use is considered a retail sale by the purchaser when the item is first used by the purchaser. The sales price (see Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 7, regarding the calculation of sales price) must be reported as a purchase subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>If the purchaser is not registered for sales and use tax and is not required to file a sales and use tax return, the purchaser must file a consumer's use tax return.</p>
                  <p>Use of the property for demonstration or display while holding it for sale or lease in the regular course of business is not a taxable use by the purchaser.</p>

Such goods comprise those belonging to the same class that do not have to be dealt with in specie (retaining existence as a distinct individual of a particular class). Common examples of fungible goods are grain in silos or elevators, oil in tanks, coal in hoppers, and lumber in piles.</p>

                  <p>To qualify for a direct pay permit, a business must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that:</p>
                  <p>A. the nature of the business is such that the direct pay method will materially reduce the administrative work of collecting the tax;</p>
                  <p>B. the firm's accounting system will clearly reflect the proper amount of tax due;</p>
                  <p>C. the firm makes taxable purchases in sufficient volume to justify the expense of regular audits by the Department of Revenue; and</p>
                  <p>D. it is in the best interests of the state to issue the permit.</p>
                  <p>Each person whose application is approved will receive a direct pay permit which will be numbered, dated, and signed by the commissioner or the commissioner's delegated representative.</p>

                  <p>The holder of a direct pay permit must furnish a copy of the direct pay permit or a statement that the holder holds a direct pay permit, the number of the permit and the date issued, to each vendor from whom the holder purchases tangible personal property on which an exemption is claimed. The use of the permit will relieve the vendor from the responsibility of collecting the sales tax on sales made to a direct pay permit holder. Each person issued a direct pay permit must keep a current list of all vendors from whom purchases are made under the direct pay method, and, upon request by the commissioner, must submit such list for examination.</p>
                  <p>The holder of a direct pay permit must either issue the permit to all vendors required to collect Minnesota sales and use taxes (except those excluded in subpart 6), and accrue all liability as a use tax, or maintain accounting records in sufficient detail to show in summary, and in respect to each transaction, the amount of sales taxes paid to vendors in each reporting period.</p>
                  <p>If the holder of the permit chooses the latter alternative, then all purchases from any one supplier must be made either exempt or taxable. It is not permissible to request the vendor to assess the sales tax on only selected transactions.</p>

                  <p>Carriers that elect to pay the tax under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.90, are governed by the following:</p>
                  <p>A. The carrier must hold or must have applied for a Minnesota sales and use tax permit. Application for such a permit must be made at the same time as the carrier's notice of election if none has previously been applied for.</p>
                  <p>B. Sales and use taxes due on the purchases and leases of tangible personal property other than mobile transportation equipment and parts and accessories attached or to be attached shall be paid directly to retailers authorized to collect the Minnesota tax at the same time and in the same manner as though no election had been made. Such property may not be purchased or leased exempt under a motor carrier direct pay authorization.</p>
                  <p>C. Mobile transportation equipment intended for use both within and without Minnesota and parts and accessories attached or to be attached may be purchased or leased tax free by presenting a copy of motor carrier direct pay authorization to the seller.</p>
                  <p>(1) Mobile transportation equipment includes trucks, tractors, and trailers used in interstate transportation.</p>
                  <p>(2) Parts and accessories attached or to be attached thereto includes refrigeration equipment, tires, batteries, repair parts, and any other property which is attached or affixed to such mobile transportation equipment.</p>
                  <p>(3) Not included in mobile transportation equipment and parts and accessories attached or to be attached thereto are equipment such as flashlights, flares, grease, oil, antifreeze, additives, containers used for packing and transporting customers' goods, dollies, pallets, hand trucks, forklift trucks, snowplows, local pickup and delivery vehicles, other warehouse and plant equipment, office supplies and equipment, etc.</p>
                  <p>D. Use taxes due in respect of mobile transportation equipment and parts and accessories attached or to be attached thereto shall be paid directly to the commissioner of revenue by way of a return filed on or before the 20th day of the month following the purchase or rental of such property. The return must show the sum of:</p>
                  <p>(1) the sales price of items purchased or leased other than mobile transportation equipment and parts and accessories attached or to be attached, which are subject to the use tax and upon which no sales or use tax has previously been paid; and</p>
                  <p>(2) an amount determined by multiplying the total cost of mobile transportation equipment and parts and accessories attached or to be attached purchased or leased during the month by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minnesota mileage as reported in the current pro rata application provided for in Minnesota Statutes, section 168.187, and the denominator of which is the total mileage reported on the current pro rata registration application.</p>
                  <p>For purposes of the computation in subitem (2), the total cost of mobile transportation equipment and parts and accessories attached or to be attached shall include the sales price of all such property purchased and the total payments for lease or rental (not including interchange between carriers) of such property for use in interstate commerce within or without Minnesota, irrespective of whether such property was physically present in Minnesota. For a new carrier without a prior year's mileage, an estimated ratio may be used subject to approval by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>E. If sales or use tax has been paid to another state on an item which is includable in the Minnesota return, a credit is allowable for such tax (limited to the Minnesota sales and use tax rate) in the same ratio as the cost of the item is included in the Minnesota tax base.</p>
                  <p>F. Withdrawal of an election to come under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.90, becomes effective only upon notice of such intent to the commissioner of revenue. If such election is withdrawn, subsequent reelection is effective only upon approval of the commissioner of revenue.</p>
                  <p>G. If an interstate motor carrier does not elect to pay Minnesota sales and use tax under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.90, then mobile transportation equipment subject to the sales tax on motor vehicles under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 297B, is not subject to the Minnesota sales and use tax under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 297A, and a sales tax on motor vehicles, equal to the sales and use tax rate, is collected at the time such equipment is registered in Minnesota. On purchases of parts, accessories, equipment, and supplies not exempt, the carrier shall pay the sales and use tax directly to registered retailers. If the retailer is not registered, the carrier shall pay the use tax directly to the commissioner of revenue.</p>

                  <p>Except as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 22 (which exempts personal property from the tax where brought in by a nonresident just prior to becoming a resident), Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.665, paragraph (c), places the burden of proof on the purchaser of tangible personal property to prove that the items which were shipped or brought into Minnesota by such purchaser were not purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or consumption in Minnesota, and thus are not subject to Minnesota sales or use tax. Whether the property has been purchased for use in Minnesota usually will be determinable at or near the time of its purchase. Thus, a nonresident purchaser who can show that property had been purchased and previously used in another state for a reasonable period of time before being brought into Minnesota for use therein, usually will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.665, paragraph (c).</p>

                  <p>Under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.80, a credit is allowed against the use tax due under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.63, from any person on any item purchased by the person if the item has previously been subjected to a sales or use tax in another state or a subdivision of the other state. The credit is allowed to the extent of the rate legally imposed on the item in the other state. If the tax paid in the other state is subject to refund by the other state, it is not legally imposed for purposes of this credit. If the rate imposed by the other state or any subdivision of the other state is equal to or higher than the rate imposed under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.63, then no tax is due. The credit is not allowed for taxes paid to a foreign country.</p>
                  <p>Calculation of use tax due is governed by Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.80. That section states that use tax provisions apply only at the rate measured by the difference between the rate fixed by Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.63, and the rate by which the previous tax was calculated in the other state. The maximum amount of tax which will be assessed by Minnesota according to Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.80, is the amount of tax calculated from the Minnesota rate. Use tax due to Minnesota is the tax prescribed by the rate in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.63, less the rate paid in the state of purchase. If the sales tax imposed in the state of purchase is equal to or greater than the amount of Minnesota use tax, no Minnesota use tax is due.</p>

Taxable food includes prepared food as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 31; soft drinks, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 32; candy, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 33; and all food sold through vending machines as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 34. Dietary supplements as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 2, are also taxable.</p>
                  <p>Under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 2, food and food ingredients, except for taxable food described in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (d), are exempt from tax.

                  <p>Retailers of prepared food, candy, or soft drinks, including but not limited to restaurants and fast food establishments, must pay the tax on all purchases of equipment and products used or consumed in the business, including fixtures and reusable items such as linens, flatware, glassware, and towels. Restaurants are specifically excluded from the class of manufacturers considered to be engaged in industrial production, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 2, paragraph (c). In addition, machinery and equipment used by restaurants in the furnishing, preparing, or serving of prepared food, candy, or soft drinks is not included in the exemption for capital equipment as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 5, paragraph (c), clause (7). Consequently, sales of equipment, electricity, gas, and steam and all other items to retailers of prepared food, candy, or soft drinks are taxable, except for the sale of exempt food and food ingredients and nonreusable items to such retailers. Nonreusable items such as souffle cups; straws; ice; swizzle sticks; paper products such as placemats, tablecloths, napkins, and doilies; paper, plastic, or wooden plates; cups; forks; toothpicks; or other items which are used or consumed by the customer as an integral part of the prepared food, candy, soft drinks, or alcoholic drinks are considered sold with the prepared food, candy, or soft drinks.

                  <p>The sale of food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller is one of the conditions that meets the definition of prepared food in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 31. Examples of "eating utensils" include plates, bowls, knives, forks, chopsticks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws. A "plate" does not include a container or packaging used to transport food. Some foods, such as foods containing certain raw animal foods requiring cooking by the consumer, and bakery items, which otherwise are excepted from the definition of prepared food, are prepared food if they meet the condition of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 31, clause (1), "food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller." This part explains when eating utensils are considered to be provided by the seller.</p>

                  <p>A. it is the seller's practice to hand the utensil to the customer along with the food;</p>
                  <p>B. it is the seller's practice to place the utensil in a package containing the customer's food, including prepackaged food when the seller places the utensil in the package;</p>
                  <p>C. it is the seller's practice to sell food with a utensil that has been prepackaged by a person other than the seller, except when the person who originally placed the utensils in the package has a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classification code of a manufacturer, sector 311, the utensil is not provided by the seller; or</p>
                  <p>D. it is the seller's practice to place the utensil on a table, counter, or similar surface for the customer to use. A utensil previously placed by the seller, for example, as part of a place setting, is considered physically given to the customer.

                  <p>When a food item that contains four or more servings packaged as one item is sold for a single price, eating utensils are considered provided by the seller if it is the seller's practice to physically give or hand the utensils to the customer as described in subpart 2, and the following items apply.</p>
                  <p>A. The number of servings in an item is as shown on the label on the item sold. In the absence of a label, a seller shall make a reasonable determination of the number of servings in the item.</p>
                  <p>B. For purposes of this subpart, "packaged" means that the food item is placed in a package by the seller or the customer either prior to or following the selection of the food.</p>
                  <p>C. For purposes of this subpart, "single price" means one price for the entire contents of the packaged food.

                  <p>The seller shall determine the prepared food sales percentage as provided in this subpart.</p>
                  <p>A. Annually, the seller shall determine a single prepared food sales percentage for all of the seller's establishments in this state combined.</p>
                  <p>B. The seller shall calculate the prepared food sales percentage as follows:</p>
                  <p>(1) add together the total sales of food where plates, bowls, glasses, or cups are necessary to receive the food from the seller, but not including alcoholic beverages, and the total sales of prepared food that meets the condition provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 31, clause (2), for all of the seller's establishments in this state combined; and</p>
                  <p>(2) divide the result of subitem (1) by the seller's total sales of all food and food ingredients, including prepared food, candy, dietary supplements, and soft drinks, but not including alcoholic beverages, for all of the seller's establishments in this state combined.</p>
                  <p>C. The seller shall calculate the percentage either each tax year or each business fiscal year, based on the seller's data from the prior tax year or business fiscal year.</p>
                  <p>D. The seller shall calculate and apply the percentage as soon as possible after accounting records are available to the seller, but not later than 90 days after the beginning of the tax or business fiscal year, whichever is used for the annual calculation.</p>
                  <p>E. Notwithstanding item C, if the seller has a new establishment in this state, the following subitems apply.</p>
                  <p>(1) The seller shall make a good faith estimate of the seller's prepared food sales percentage for the seller's first year.</p>
                  <p>(2) If the seller has both new and established businesses in this state, the seller shall combine the good faith estimate for the new establishment and the data from the prior tax year or business fiscal year for the established businesses.</p>
                  <p>(3) After the first three months of operation of the new establishment, if actual sales of the new establishment are such that the prepared food sales percentage for all of the seller's establishments in this state combined, either decreases from greater than 75 percent to 75 percent or less, or increases from 75 percent or less to greater than 75 percent, the seller shall adjust the seller's good faith estimate and apply it prospectively.</p>
                  <p>F. "Seller's establishments" means business operations in Minnesota owned by the same person, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 2, paragraphs (a) and (b).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">6</inline>. <b>Examples.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. The following subitems are examples of utensils originally placed in a package by a person other than the seller.</p>
                  <p>(1) A caterer sells a boxed lunch with utensils packaged inside to a concessionaire who sells the boxed lunch. The caterer has a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classification code of sector 722. The concessionaire provides the eating utensils when selling the boxed lunch to a customer, and the boxed lunch is prepared food.</p>
                  <p>(2) A food manufacturer packages ready-to-eat lunches with eating utensils and sells to a grocer. Since the person that sold the packages to the grocer has a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classification code of a manufacturer, sector 311, the grocer is not providing the eating utensils with the food when selling the ready-to-eat lunch. Other examples of utensils provided by a manufacturer include snack package combinations of cheese and crackers that contain a spreader, ice cream cups that are packaged with wooden or plastic spoons, and juice boxes that are packaged with drinking straws. However, when the grocer physically gives or hands a utensil to the customer along with the item, the utensil given by the grocer is "provided by the seller."</p>
                  <p>B. The following subitems are examples explaining whether a food item that contains four or more servings packaged as one item is sold for a "single price."</p>
                  <p>(1) A restaurant, with a convenience food area near the cash register, sells a package of cinnamon rolls, labeled at 12 servings, for $5.98, an apple for 75 cents, and a single-serving container of milk for 49 cents. There is a napkin dispenser and a drinking straw dispenser on a counter nearby. The restaurant is owned by a seller whose establishments in this state have a combined prepared food sales percentage of 85 percent, meaning that for most of the restaurant's sales of food, the seller only has to make utensils available to the customer. Since the package of cinnamon rolls has four or more servings and it is sold for a single price, the seller is not providing a utensil in its sale of the cinnamon rolls simply because a utensil is available for the customer, and therefore the cinnamon rolls are not prepared food. The utensils are provided by the seller for the apple and the single-serving container of milk, since the utensils are available.</p>
                  <p>(2) A bakery, owned by a seller whose establishments in this state combined have a sales percentage of 80 percent, sells fruit pies it baked at $2 a slice. Each slice equals one serving. Five slices are packaged and sold for $9.40. The sales receipt simply provides that the price of the apple pie is $9.40. This package is sold for a single price. Since the item of four or more servings is sold for a single price, the item is not considered prepared food unless the utensils are physically given or handed to the customer, even if the seller has utensils available to the customer.</p>
                  <p>(3) As described in subitem (2), the customer purchases five slices of apple pie and the slices are packaged in one container. The sales receipt, however, indicates that the slices are sold five at $2 each, for a total price of $10. This package is not sold for a single price, since the seller charged $2 for each slice in the package, as shown by the sales receipt. Therefore, if the seller has utensils available to the customer, the utensils are considered to be provided by the seller, meaning that the pie slices are considered prepared food and are subject to tax. However, if the bakery neither has utensils available, nor hands or gives utensils to the customer, then the bakery items are not considered prepared food.</p>
                  <p>C. The following subitems are examples of combined sales from a seller's establishments for purposes of the prepared food sales percentage under subpart 5.</p>
                  <p>(1) A partnership owns two business operations in Minnesota, both restaurants. The partnership is a person, under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 2, and therefore the sales from both restaurants are combined by the partnership for purposes of calculating the prepared food sales percentage under subpart 5.</p>
                  <p>(2) A sole proprietor of a small grocery store is one of the partners in the example in subitem (1). The partnership does not combine the sales from the grocery store with the sales from the restaurants because the partnership does not own the grocery store. Similarly, the sole proprietor does not combine the sales from the restaurants with the sales from its grocery store, as the partnership owns the restaurants, not the sole proprietor. The sole proprietor calculates the prepared food sales percentage based on the sales from the grocery store and any other establishments owned by the sole proprietor.</p>
                  <p>(3) Corporation X owns three cafeterias and one sandwich shop. Corporation Y owns a convenience store. Corporation Z owns 100 percent of the shares of both Corporations X and Y. While Corporation Z owns the two corporations, it is not the person that owns the business operations, and therefore does not combine the sales of Corporations X and Y. Rather, Corporation X calculates the prepared food sales percentage based on the sales from its cafeterias and sandwich shop, and Corporation Y calculates the prepared food sales percentage based on the sales from its convenience store.</p>

                  <p>Notwithstanding the application of subparts 1 through 6, if a food is considered "prepared food" under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 31, clause (2), because it is sold in a heated state or heated by the seller, or because the seller mixed or combined two or more food ingredients as a single item, excepting the foods listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 31, clause (2), items (i) through (iv), the food is still taxed as prepared food.</p>
                  <p>Example: a pizzeria prepares, heats, and sells pizzas by the slice solely for pick-up, and does not have any utensils available or given to the customer. The business has a prepared food sales percentage greater than 75 percent, so that it only need have utensils available for any food sold at the establishment for the utensils to be considered "provided by the seller." However, the fact that no utensils are provided by the seller does not mean that the pizza is not prepared food. Rather, it is prepared food because it is heated by the seller and also because the seller combines food ingredients and sells it as a single item.</p>

                  <p>All fuels not subject to the tax imposed by Minnesota Statutes, chapter 296A, or for which a refund of the petroleum tax has been allowed because the buyer used the fuel for nonhighway use, are subject to sales and use tax unless exempted under other provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Law. Unless another exemption applies, use tax must be reported on a sales or use tax return in relation to the month in which a petroleum tax refund is issued.</p>
                  <p>Example. Trucking company is a bulk purchaser (as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 296A.01, subdivision 9) and orders 100,000 gallons of petroleum products in October. It instructs the distributor to deliver 70,000 gallons to a storage tank used to supply such petroleum products to licensed motor vehicles owned and operated by it. The remaining 30,000 gallons are delivered to a storage tank used to supply fuel oil for heating trucking company's premises. For the month of October, trucking company reports and pays the special fuel (as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 296A.01, subdivision 46) excise tax on 70,000 gallons. Trucking company files a sales and use tax return and reports and pays a tax on the purchase price of the 30,000 gallons of petroleum products used for space heating. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.63 for application of use tax.</p>

                  <p>There is a sales and use tax exemption for materials used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production of personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail. This exemption is found in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9. The provisions of this part apply to those persons engaged in agricultural or industrial production. Agricultural and industrial production includes any step or steps in the production process. It also includes the production, fabrication, printing, or processing of tangible personal property for consumers for consideration, defined as a sale under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 3, paragraph (b).</p>
                  <p>Materials that are used or consumed in providing a service other than production, fabrication, printing, or processing of tangible personal property for retail sale are taxable.</p>
                  <p>Generally, the production process begins with the removal of raw materials from stock for the purpose of commencing activities effecting changes thereon in the course of producing the intended product. The production process ends when the completed state is achieved. The completed state includes the packaging of the individual product, but not palletizing or otherwise preparing the packaged product for shipment. If the product is not packaged, the process ends when it is placed into finished goods inventory. If the package is not placed into finished goods inventory prior to shipment, the process ends when the last process prior to loading for shipment has been completed.</p>
                  <p>Quality control, testing, design, and research and development activities are part of the production process. The production process does not include the storage and preservation of raw materials prior to commencement of the production process; the handling, movement, storage, and preservation of completed goods; or the painting, cleaning, repairing, and maintenance of equipment and facilities. Agricultural and industrial production does not include the preparation, cooking, mixing, or furnishing of meals. "Meals" means food which will ordinarily be consumed without delay and without further preparation or storage.</p>
                  <p>In the case of mining or quarrying, the production process begins with the removal of overburden from the site of the ore, mineral, peat deposit, or surface materials and ends when the last process before stockpiling is performed. If the product is not stockpiled before shipment, the production process ends when the last process before loading for shipment has been completed.</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9, provides exemption for all materials used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production of personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail, whether or not the item so used becomes an ingredient or constituent part of the property produced. All materials that are ingredients or component parts of the product, and materials that act on or come in contact with the product but that are not machinery, equipment, implements, tools, accessories, appliances, contrivances, furniture, or fixtures, are within this exemption. Examples of such exempt materials are grinding compounds, polishing compounds, and lithographic printing plates. The phrase "used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production" also includes materials that are only used once in production and even though they have not been physically consumed will not be used again. Examples of such exempt materials that could qualify for this exemption are keylines, typeset used for printing, and paper pan and cake liners used for baking goods.</p>

                  <p>The purchase or use of chemicals or fertilizers for use or consumption in agricultural or industrial production is not taxable.</p>
                  <p>The purchase of chemicals and fertilizers for application to agricultural crops to achieve soil fertilization, weed control, or elimination of crop disease, or to prevent or destroy pest infestation of growing crops is not taxable. The agricultural crops must be grown for sale or as feed for use or consumption in agricultural production.</p>
                  <p>The purchase of chemicals for the control or eradication of pests is exempt if used for the health and protection of those animals whose feed is exempt under subpart 11. For purposes of this subpart, "pest" means an insect, rodent, nematode, fungus, weed, terrestrial or aquatic plant, animal life, virus, bacteria, or other organism. Pest control chemicals include insecticides (fly sprays, fly tapes, louse killers), pesticides, and rodenticides (mouse, rat, and gopher poison).</p>
                  <p>Chemicals and fertilizers that are purchased for nonproduction use such as lawn fertilizers, weed control chemicals used in a lawn or garden, or insect spray for home use, are all taxable.</p>
                  <p>Herbicides and fertilizers that are purchased by farmers for use on land that is part of the Conservation Reserve Program or other specifically enumerated government program are exempted under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9.</p>
                  <p>Detergents or other cleaning chemicals used in cleaning factory or farm buildings, including buildings used to house animals, are taxable. However, disinfectants that are not merely detergent additives and that are applied to agricultural animals, or used to disinfect their surroundings to control or eradicate animal disease or pests, are not taxable.</p>
                  <p>Chemicals used for cleaning food processing machinery and equipment are also exempt. However, the chemicals used to clean the area surrounding the food processing machinery and equipment are taxable.</p>
                  <p>Chemicals that are used to clean tooling or equipment that is used in production are taxable because the chemicals are not used or consumed in the production process.</p>
                  <p>However, if applying the chemical to the tooling or equipment, other than for ordinary cleaning and maintenance, is required to manufacture the particular product, the purchase of that chemical is exempt.</p>

                  <p>The purchase of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, and water that is used or consumed directly in agricultural or industrial production is not taxable. If these items are used for space heating or lighting, however, they are taxable.</p>
                  <p>The purchase of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, or water to power a machine or fixture that controls the lighting or climate of a building is taxable, unless the lighting or climate control is a special requirement necessary to produce that particular agricultural or industrial product. If the lighting or climate control is a special requirement, then the amount of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, or water used for that lighting or climate control is not taxable. The amount used must be determined by deducting the amount of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, or water used to maintain average lighting or climate control from the total amount used for lighting or climate control. "Average climate control" means a summer temperature range of 73 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit and a winter temperature range of 68 to 74.5 degrees Fahrenheit. "Average lighting" means the amount of wattage per square foot necessary to adequately light the area if lighting is not a special requirement necessary to produce a particular agricultural or industrial product.</p>
                  <p>There is a separate statutory exemption for electricity used to make snow for certain ski areas. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">6</inline>. <b>Packaging materials.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Sales of materials to persons engaged in agricultural or industrial production for use in packaging, shipping, or delivering tangible personal property produced or manufactured by them are exempt. Packaging material includes nonreturnable containers, but does not include returnable containers except as otherwise specified in this subpart.</p>
                  <p>Packaging materials do not include reusable containers, reusable pallets, or other reusable materials that are used to ship tangible personal property between production facilities, or for handling, storing, or moving materials within the confines of business premises.</p>
                  <p>"Container" means the articles in which tangible personal property is placed for shipment and delivery, such as cartons, cans, and bags. Container does not include items that are used primarily to facilitate loading, unloading, handling, transportation, or storage of products, such as bakery delivery carts, bread trays, skids, pallets, milk carts, and milk crates.</p>
                  <p>Items A to M govern the tax status of specific packaging materials and containers.</p>
                  <p>A. Price tags, shipping tags and address labels, packing slip envelopes, invoices, and advertising matter to be used in connection with the sale of property or to be enclosed with property sold are not packaging materials.</p>
                  <p>B. Labels that are used to identify the contents of a package are exempt. For example, a grocery store is engaged in production when it cuts and wraps meat or produce. The content labels that are used on the meat or produce are not taxable because they are packaging material. Price labels that do not contain any content information are not packaging materials and are taxable.</p>
                  <p>C. Returnable containers constitute equipment and generally are not within the scope of the exemption provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 2. However, purchases of returnable containers for use in packaging food and beverage products are within the exemption by specific statutory authorization. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 2.</p>
                  <p>D. Returnable containers are designed and ordinarily used for more than one-time use as containers. They are customarily expected or required to be returned by customers for reuse. Vendors commonly require a deposit or payment by the customer with the understanding that the amount of the deposit will be refunded either in cash or in credit when the container is returned. Regardless of the condition or appearance of the container, it is a returnable container if the vendor requires a deposit or payment from the customer and if there is an express or implied agreement that the deposit will be refunded upon return of the container.</p>
                  <p>E. Deposits that are charged to customers as security for the return of containers are not subject to tax if separately stated on the invoice or billing.</p>
                  <p>F. Purchases of materials used to repair or recondition taxable returnable containers by the owners of those containers are taxable.</p>
                  <p>G. Nonreturnable containers are considered packaging material. The sale of nonreturnable containers used to package an article of tangible personal property for sale is exempt.</p>
                  <p>H. Internal packaging materials are those used inside of packages and containers in order to shape, form, preserve, stabilize, or protect the contents. All internal packaging materials purchased for use in packaging food and beverage products are exempt.</p>
                  <p>I. If the internal packaging materials are not being used to package food and beverage products, then the taxability of those packaging materials depends on whether they are returnable. If the materials are returnable, then they are treated as machinery or equipment and are taxable. If the materials are not returnable, then they are not taxable.</p>
                  <p>J. External packaging materials are those used under, outside of, and among packages and containers to protect, brace, pad, or cushion the packages or containers against damage, motion, shock, or breakage while being shipped. These materials are commonly known as dunnage and are exempt when purchased for use in industrial or agricultural production of tangible personal property and used to ship products to customers. However, sales of these same items to vendors of transportation services are taxable unless otherwise exempted by Minnesota Statutes, sections 297A.61 to 297A.995. If the materials are returnable, they are equipment and are taxable. If the external packaging materials are not returnable, they are not taxable.</p>
                  <p>K. External packaging materials do not include items that are used primarily to facilitate loading, unloading, handling, transportation, or storage of products, such as bakery delivery carts, bread trays, skids, pallets, milk carts, and milk crates.</p>
                  <p>L. The taxability of skids and pallets depends on whether they are returnable. If the skids and pallets are returnable, they are equipment and taxable. If the pallets and skids are not returnable, they are not taxable.</p>
                  <p>M. Sales of packaging materials, such as bags, wrapping paper, boxes, and clothes hangers, to vendors of services are not exempt under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 2. Meat locker operators are vendors of services when they cut meat furnished by their customers into smaller pieces, which they wrap and place in cold storage for the customers' convenience. Sales of wrapping paper, tape, and other materials to vendors for this purpose are taxable. However, meat locker operators who also make retail sales as well as cutting meat furnished by their customers may purchase wrapping materials exempt for resale and report and pay use tax on the portion of the wrapping materials used in performing the cutting service.</p>

                  <p>The definition of production found in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9, includes the production of road building materials. When a manufacturer of road building materials purchases materials that will be used or consumed in the manufacturing of asphalt, bituminous mix, or other road building materials to be sold at retail, those purchases are not taxable. For purposes of this exemption, it does not matter that the road building materials will ultimately be sold for use in building parking lots and driveways. When that person sells the road building materials to someone who will use them to build or repair roads, or for any other nonexempt purpose, the entire sales price of the road building materials is subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>When a person produces road building materials for the person's own use in building or repairing roads, including a contract to build or repair roads for others, the materials used to produced the road materials are not exempt as materials used or consumed in industrial production. Because the person puts them to that person's own use in building, improving, or repairing roads, that person is not selling the road building materials at retail, as required for the exemption, but is engaged in improving real property. That person must pay sales or use tax on any materials used to make the road building materials that the person is going to use.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">8</inline>. <b>Taxable equipment.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The exemption provided by Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9, does not include machinery, equipment, implements, tools, accessories, appliances, contrivances, furniture, or fixtures used in production, or fuel, electricity, gas, or steam used for space heating or lighting. Accordingly, a sales or use tax is imposed on not only a machine itself but on any repair parts for it. The tool or accessory that performs the work of the machine, including saw blades, grinding wheels, cutters, files, molds, dies, patterns, jigs, printing plates, and similar items, are also taxable unless exempted under subpart 9 as short-lived separate detachable units.</p>
                  <p>Materials or fabrication labor purchased by a person engaged in agricultural or industrial production are taxable if used to manufacture or fabricate equipment, tools, or similar items which are not intended for resale, but for the person's own use in the production process. Examples of materials are plastic, metal, or wood used in making patterns or jigs, and sand used in making molds. However, if the equipment, tools, or similar items to be manufactured or fabricated would qualify under subpart 9 as short-lived separate detachable units, then the materials and fabrication labor are exempt.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">9</inline>. <b>Separate detachable units.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The exemption for industrial and agricultural production, provided under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9, includes accessory tools, equipment, and other short-lived items that satisfy the following conditions: (1) they are separate detachable units; (2) they are used in producing a direct effect upon the product; and (3) they have an ordinary useful life of less than 12 months.</p>
                  <p>All three conditions must be satisfied before an item is exempt. The item must be used to produce personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail. If the item is used for maintenance purposes, or to produce other tooling for in-house use, it is not exempt. For purposes of this exemption, the words "separate detachable units," "used in producing a direct effect," and "ordinary useful life," have the meanings given them in items A to C.</p>
                  <p>A. "Separate detachable units" means accessory tools, equipment, or short-lived items that are attached to machinery when being used. These items are generally purchased separately from the purchase of the basic machine and do not include the basic machine and its component parts such as belts, pulleys, gears, shafts, and bearings. Examples of items considered to be separate detachable units include, but are not limited to, drill bits, cutting tools, grinding wheels, abrasive and polishing belts, sheets and discs, taps, reamers, printing plates, saw blades, and certain dies, jigs, patterns, and molds; however, if these items are included in the purchase price of the basic machine, and their cost is not separately stated, they are considered as part of the basic machine and taxable. Subsequent replacement of these items is exempt. Hand tools such as hammers, pliers, clamps, wrenches, screwdrivers, crowbars, soldering irons, knives, and power hand tools, are not separate detachable units and are not exempt. Attachments to hand tools are considered separate detachable units only if similarly functioning items attached to machinery would be considered separate detachable units. Examples of hand tool attachments considered to be separate detachable units include drill bits, grinding wheels, sandpaper disks, and sawblades.</p>
                  <p>B. "Used in producing a direct effect" means accessory tools, equipment, and other short-lived items that are used or consumed in industrial or agricultural production in a manner that directly causes a physical or chemical change upon or within the materials being processed. Examples of items within this exemption include, but are not limited to, drill bits, cutting tools, grinding wheels, abrasive and polishing belts, sheets and discs, taps, reamers, printing plates, saw blades, and certain dies, jigs, patterns, and molds. Examples of items not exempt under this provision are conveyor belts and rollers that only serve to move the product from place to place.</p>
                  <p>The phrase "used in producing a direct effect upon the product" does not require a direct physical contact with the product. Items that do not come into contact with material being processed, and that are not the agents that by direct contact with the product produce physical or chemical changes, are considered to be used in producing a direct effect upon the product if their use serves the purpose of determining the shape, contour, configuration, content, or arrangement of content of the product, or any part of the product, being produced.</p>
                  <p>Such items are considered to be used in producing a direct effect since the desired change in the material being acted upon is accomplished only by the combined effect of the items acting in conjunction with other items that actually have the direct physical contact with the product.</p>
                  <p>Items that are used in creating and/or maintaining a condition that must prevail before a desired physical or chemical change can be effected on a product are not considered as being used to produce a direct effect; i.e., the physical or chemical change sought in the material being processed.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate the application of this rule, the following examples of qualifying and nonqualifying items are given in subitems (1) and (2).</p>
                  <p>(1) Qualifying items: Master tapes from which copies are made are the media that determine the arrangement of the magnetic materials on the copy and therefore qualify as "used in producing a direct effect" resulting in the reproduction; and photographic transparencies that are used in conjunction with light to produce a desired effect that the light alone would not produce. These transparencies qualify as "used in producing a direct effect upon the product."</p>
                  <p>(2) Nonqualifying items: Drill extension bars, drill chucks, and burner tips. These items might be considered separate detachable units, but they neither cause the physical or chemical change that might be associated with their use, nor is their use for the purpose of determining the shape, contour, configuration, content, or arrangement of content of the product, or any part of the product, being produced. They are used merely to hold or guide the item or process.</p>
                  <p>C. "Ordinary useful life" means the life of accessory tools, equipment, and other short-lived items measured by continuous use in production under normal conditions of the user. Continuous use under "normal conditions of the user" means normal but continuous use during the producer's normal business hours. Items that would otherwise qualify that are not used continuously but would last less than 12 months if production required continuous use are exempt. For example, a producer, whose normal conditions include a 15-hour business day, six days a week, uses a mold which otherwise qualifies under items A and B. If the mold had been used continuously during the producer's normal business hours of 15 hours a day, it would have been exhausted in four months. The four months is the mold's ordinary useful life. The producer, however, only uses the item for short production runs, a few days at a time, so it will not wear out for two years. This item qualifies even though the length of time retained is more than 12 months, since the item would not last 12 months if used continuously during the producer's normal business hours. An "ordinary useful life of less than 12 months" can be shown by providing evidence that prior purchases of similar items had useful lives of less than 12 months.</p>
                  <p>Junking, scrapping, wearing out, or disposing of the item is conclusive evidence of the end of its ordinary useful life. Keeping an item after it has been used is not evidence of continued useful life unless the item is reused or is held for reuse in the taxpayer's ordinary production process. Repair (as defined in part 8130.0700) of an item is not evidence of the end of that item's ordinary useful life. For example, when an item that has an ordinary useful life of two years needs a repair six months after it has been purchased, the repair does not mean the item's useful life is six months.</p>

                  <p>The purchase of feed, feed additives, and feed supplements for use or consumption in agricultural or industrial production is exempt. Such feeds are used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production if they are fed to (1) agricultural animals raised for sale; (2) animals kept for use in agricultural production; (3) farm work stock; and (4) the following animals while they are being raised for sale on a commercial basis: fur-bearing animals, animals used as a source of wool, pets, and research animals. "Agricultural animals" means cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, dairy animals, poultry, honey bees, fish, or other animals that are commercially raised for sale. "Farm work stock" means animals, such as draft horses, mules, oxen, and herd dogs, which are used exclusively for farming. "Fur-bearing animal" means a fox, mink, fitch, chinchilla, karakul, marten, nutria, or fisher that is second or later generation raised in captivity. "Pet" means any domesticated animal normally maintained in or near the household of the owner and kept for affection and pleasure rather than for utility or profit. The purchase of feed is subject to tax if it is to be fed to animals that are not used or consumed in agricultural production, or to those animals, such as a pet or a riding horse, that are not being raised for sale on a commercial basis.</p>

The purchase of lawn seeds or plants, flower seeds or plants, vegetable seeds or plants, or other similar seeds or plants, for nonproduction use, is taxable. Generally, tree seedlings purchased for windbreaks are not used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production and are taxable. Seeds and trees purchased by farmers for use on land that is part of the Conservation Reserve Program or other specifically enumerated government program are exempted under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">13</inline>. <b>Agricultural production.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. Under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 13, the term "agricultural production," as used in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9, includes, but is not limited to, the terms "horticulture," "floriculture," and "raising of pets, fur-bearing animals, research animals, and horses." Agricultural production also includes "aquiculture."</p>
                  <p>(1) "Horticulture" means the cultivation of a garden or an orchard; the science of growing fruits and vegetables and flowers or plants.</p>
                  <p>(2) "Agriculture" means the art or science of cultivating the soil, especially in fields or in large quantities, including the preservation of the soil; the planting of seeds; the raising and harvesting of crops; the rearing, feeding, and management of livestock; tillage; husbandry; and farming.</p>
                  <p>(3) "Floriculture" means the cultivation of flowering plants.</p>
                  <p>(4) "Aquiculture" means the cultivation of plants and animals in water for harvest, including hydroponics and raising fish in fish farms.</p>
                  <p>The activities defined in this item are agricultural production to the extent that the "person" as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 2, commercially engages in the activities so described, or if the product of the activities is on a scale comparable with that of a commercial producer. The agricultural activity must result in the production of personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail.</p>
                  <p>B. Generally, the sale of an animal is taxable because it is the sale of tangible personal property. However, there are some exceptions for certain animals associated with agricultural production. See item C. The purchase of animals for use as pets is taxable. The purchase of animals for use as breeding stock is taxable unless the offspring of that animal, if purchased separately, would otherwise be exempt under this subpart.</p>
                  <p>C. The purchase of animals that will be used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production is exempt. This includes animals used in research and development. It also includes domesticated animals that are purchased solely as a commercial source of wool, and domesticated fur-bearing animals purchased as a commercial source of pelts. "Solely as a commercial source of wool" means the animals are purchased for use other than as work animals, as pets, for show or exhibition, or for any purpose other than the processing or selling of the wool for profit. The purchase of animals which will be used as food for humans is exempt. The purchase of animals for the purpose of using them as an ingredient in a manufacturing process, such as for the production of food for animals or poultry, is exempt. Game animals and game birds, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 97A.015, constitute food for human consumption.</p>
                  <p>D. Generally, charges for breeding animals are not taxable. However, fees for the breeding of certain racing horses are taxable. See the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 3, clause (h).</p>
                  <p>The purchase of veterinarian services or drugs and medicines used in agricultural or industrial production is not taxable. See part 8130.8700 for more detail regarding veterinarian services. The purchase of semen to be used and consumed in agricultural production is exempt. The initial sale and subsequent refills of liquid nitrogen are treated as a sale of a chemical used in the processing of an agricultural product and are exempt. The sale or lease of liquid nitrogen tanks is taxable. Also taxable are semen supplies such as charts, office records, inseminating gloves, and inseminating catheters.</p>
                  <p>E. The purchase of farm machinery and equipment such as tractors, combines, corn pickers, milking machines, and other equipment used directly and principally in agricultural production is subject to sales tax at a statutorily reduced rate. See Minnesota Statutes, sections 297A.01, subdivision 15, and 297A.02, subdivision 2, for more details on farm machinery.</p>
                  <p>F. Equipment and machinery that do not qualify for the farm machinery reduced rate, such as trucks, trailers, air compressors, and ventilator fans, are subject to tax at the general rate. "Farm machinery" does not include repair or replacement parts. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 15. Therefore, it is the general rule that repair or replacement parts of farm machinery are subject to tax at the general rate. Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 29, however, specifically exempts the gross receipts from the sale of repair and replacement parts, except tires, which are assigned a specific or generic part number by the manufacturer of farm machinery that qualifies for the reduced rate referred to in item E. To qualify for this exemption, the purchaser must be in the business of agricultural production. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 29.</p>
                  <p>G. The purchase of aquaculture production equipment such as automatic feed systems, net pens, fish counting equipment, oxygen generators, water diversion devices, and other new or used machinery, equipment, implements, accessories, and contrivances used directly and principally in aquaculture production is subject to sales tax at the reduced rate imposed by Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.02, subdivision 2. Repair or replacement parts for aquaculture production equipment are subject to tax at the general rate. See Minnesota Statutes, sections 17.47, subdivisions 2 and 7, and 297A.01, subdivision 19, for more details on aquaculture and aquaculture production equipment.</p>

                  <p>Special tooling is exempt. "Special tooling" is defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 6. Special tooling is tooling that is made to specific requirements to produce a part or a series of related parts, which are known at the time the special tooling is manufactured for a single customer. The special tooling itself must be unique. If the tooling is available from a catalog, other sales literature, or over-the-counter, the tooling is standard and not special tooling.</p>
                  <p>Because special tooling does not need to produce a direct effect upon the product, nor does it need to have an ordinary useful life of less than 12 months, special tooling is usually different from accessory tools as defined in part 8130.5500, subpart 9, (separate detachable units). Certain special tooling may also be exempt from tax as separate detachable units or as accessory tools because the definitions are not exclusive. See subpart 3, item B.</p>

                  <p>Materials from which special tooling or component parts are produced by a seller of special tooling need not themselves be unique and useable only by the seller who produces special tooling. For example, metal used to produce special tooling need not be unique metal, only the special tooling produced from the metal needs to be unique. However, special tooling or components of special tooling must be unique, having value and use only for the buyer of special tooling.</p>
                  <p>Special tooling comprised of components qualifies for the exemption to the extent of the purchase price of the unique components. Unique components are those components which are manufactured for the special tooling and are not standard or reusable. Components of special tooling which can be reused, either in special tooling or general applications, do not qualify for the exemption.</p>

                  <p>A. Machine tools and machinery are usually frames and motors which, through tools and special tooling, perform an action on materials to produce a product. They are commonly purchased in a standard configuration and can be used to produce parts for more than one customer. Attachments to machine tools and machinery that are used with the machine tool or machinery generally are not produced in accordance with special requirements of the purchaser of special tooling and do not qualify for the special tooling exemption. They are not special tooling. Machine tools and machinery and their accessories can be used by any person other than the purchaser who wants to perform a function similar to the purchaser's. This quality excludes them from the definition of special tooling. Examples of machine tools and machinery include:</p>
                  <p>(1) lathes;</p>
                  <p>(2) mills;</p>
                  <p>(3) machining centers;</p>
                  <p>(4) grinders;</p>
                  <p>(5) presses;</p>
                  <p>(6) shears;</p>
                  <p>(7) breaks;</p>
                  <p>(8) die and mold machines; and</p>
                  <p>(9) screw machines.</p>
                  <p>B. Accessory tools, as included within the definition of separate detachable units, are typically standard items which are loaded into a machine tool or hand-held machine and which produce a direct effect on the product. The definitional conditions required of exempt accessory tools in part 8130.5500 are that: they are separate detachable units; they are used in producing a direct effect upon the product; and they have an ordinary life of less than 12 months. These conditions are not the same as those for special tooling. Generally, accessory tools can be purchased from a catalog or over-the-counter without any special fabrication. Further, usually any person requiring the action of an accessory tool on a product can use the accessory tool, so it is not limited in use or value only to the buyer. For example, anyone who needs thread cut can use a tap, so it has general value and is not special tooling.</p>
                  <p>Although an accessory tool usually does not qualify as special tooling, the statutory definitions do not preclude tangible personal property from qualifying as both an accessory tool and special tooling. If, for example, a cutting tool is made for a special purpose which is unique to a single customer, it qualifies both as an accessory tool and special tooling. Examples of tools that are usually accessory tools are:</p>
                  <p>(1) drill bits;</p>
                  <p>(2) cutting tools;</p>
                  <p>(3) grinding wheels;</p>
                  <p>(4) abrasive and polishing belts;</p>
                  <p>(5) taps;</p>
                  <p>(6) reamers; and</p>
                  <p>(7) saw blades.</p>

The term does not include hand bills, circulars, flyers, or the like, unless distributed as a part of a newspaper as defined. The term "publication" includes "shoppers guides" distributed by a publisher, where space in such publication generally is available to advertisers for the purpose of inducing readers to purchase goods or services from such advertisers.</p>
                  <p>House organs, trade, professional, and other types of magazines and journals regularly issued at average intervals not exceeding three months are included within the meaning of "publication." "Comic books" are "publications" if published serially under the same title at least once quarterly; however, comic books complete in themselves and without continuity of title and subject matter are not publications.</p>
                  <p>The following are representative of items not included within the meaning of "publication": books, including those issued at regular or stated intervals, e.g., books sold by a book-of-the-month or other club or organization; so called "one-shot" magazines that have no literary or subject matter connection or continuity between prior or subsequent issues; price lists; hand bills; catalogs; programs; score cards; maps; sheet music; yearbooks; directories; bulletins; political newsletters issued during a campaign only, and not of a continuing nature at regular intervals not exceeding three months; loose leaf or similar personal service publications such as tax information services, labor information services, credit or financial information services (however, special reports not distributed generally are deemed personal services), law cases and briefs; realtors' descriptive listings, financial and statistical reports, unless published as a supplement or enclosure with or part of a qualified newspaper.</p>

                  <p>A. As provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 23, the sales or use tax does not apply to isolated or occasional sales of tangible personal property or a service made by a person who is not engaged in selling such property or service in the normal course of business. This exemption does not apply to a sale of tangible personal property that is primarily used in a trade or business.</p>
                  <p>B. Under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25, the sale of tangible personal property that is primarily used in a trade or business is exempt if the sale is not made in the normal course of business of selling that kind of property and the sale meets one of the listed conditions.</p>

                  <p>For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:</p>
                  <p>A. "Isolated" means standing alone or solitary.</p>
                  <p>B. "Normal course of business" is defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 21. The sale of inventory is considered to be made in the normal course of business and thus is subject to tax. The lease of tangible personal property is subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. A bank repossesses secured property. This is part of the bank's business. Repossessed items are considered to be inventory in possession of the bank and the sale by the bank is considered to be made during the normal course of business and is subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. A construction company leases excavating and hauling equipment without an operator to another business, when not otherwise in use. The leasing is considered to take place in the normal course of business and is subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. A luxury boat business sells one or two boats a year. The sales are taxable because, while the sales are infrequent, they are made in the normal course of business.</p>
                  <p>C. "Occasional" means occurring at infrequent intervals, as incidental, or as casual; that is, as distinguished from events of a similar nature recurring with some degree of regularity.</p>
                  <p>Example. A person has a garage sale once each year. The sale is considered to be occasional.</p>
                  <p>D. "Trade or business" means any continuous and regular activity carried on for the production of income from selling goods or performing services. Organizations exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code, subchapter F, such as organizations exempt under section 501(c)(3), are only considered to be engaged in a trade or business to the extent the activity is unrelated to their exempt purposes. Government organizations, including public schools, are not considered to be engaged in a trade or business since most of their activities are conducted to further a public purpose. However, if the government entity makes sales of surplus equipment or other tangible personal property on a regular basis, it is considered to be engaged in a trade or business.</p>
                  <p>Examples of a trade or business: apartment buildings or other rental property, home day care centers, farms, law offices, manufacturers, retail stores, and restaurants.</p>
                  <p>Examples of entities that are not considered to be engaged in a trade or business: American Red Cross, churches, nonprofit hospitals, and government agencies.</p>
                  <p>Example of an exempt organization engaging in a taxable activity: a nonprofit hospital also has a gift shop that sells taxable items to the general public. The gift shop is considered to be engaged in a trade or business. Sales of items used by the hospital, such as waiting room furniture, are not subject to tax because the hospital is not a business. However, sales of items used by the gift shop, such as shelves or computers used in the store, are taxable, unless one of the exclusions under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25, applies, since these activities are not related to the hospital's exempt purpose.</p>
                  <p>E. "Primarily used" means used in the trade or business 50 percent or more of its operating time. If it is used less than 50 percent of the time in the trade or business, it is not used primarily in the trade or business and may qualify for the isolated or occasional sale exemption. The seller's use of the equipment is the determining factor. It does not matter how the buyer uses the item.</p>
                  <p>Example. An owner of a lawn mower has a small business operation to mow the neighbors' yards. The lawn mower is used 60 percent of the time for the owner's lawn and 40 percent of the time for the neighbors' lawns. Since the mower is used less than 50 percent of the time in the owner's business, it is not considered to be used primarily in a trade or business.</p>
                  <p>F. "Substantially all of the assets of a trade or business," as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25, paragraph (a), clause (5), or "substantially all of the property sold," as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25, paragraph (b), clause (1), means 90 percent or more of the total fair market value of tangible personal property and does not include property that is subject to an ad valorem property tax. It also includes the assets of a separate division, branch, or other identifiable segment of a business, if before the sale, the income and expenses attributable to the separate division, branch, or segment could be separately ascertained from the records. If the separate division, branch, or segment is leased or rented, rather than sold, the assets are taxable.</p>
                  <p>Example. A company has a retail hardware business, as well as a building construction division. The records of the businesses are kept separately. The retail hardware business closes while the construction division continues to exist. The sale of all the assets of the hardware business is exempt from tax. Sales of inventory items are taxable.</p>

                  <p>An isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal property or a service by a person who is not in the business of selling that kind of property or service is not subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>The following transactions are considered to be isolated or occasional sales because they are infrequent sales of a nonrecurring nature made by a person not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property or a service.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. The sale of a used vacuum cleaner by one neighbor to another.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. Payment from a neighbor for mowing a neighbor's grass or taking care of a pet while the neighbor is on vacation.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. Sales by executors, administrators, trustees, and other fiduciaries in the liquidation of an estate, except inventory or stock in trade or tangible personal property primarily used in a trade or business.</p>
                  <p>Example 4. Sales or executions pursuant to a court order or by a court officer, except inventory or stock in trade or tangible personal property primarily used in a trade or business.</p>

                  <p>The following are examples of transactions that are not considered isolated or occasional sales:</p>
                  <p>A. The sale of property held primarily for sales to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. Leasing company sells to X a bulldozer that was previously used in its business by leasing to others. Since a lease constitutes a sale, leasing company is deemed to be in the business of selling this kind of property. The sale of the bulldozer to X is not an isolated or occasional sale.</p>
                  <p>B. The infrequent sale of an inventory item by a retailer, jobber, or other vendor, even though such sales do not happen often and only comprise an insignificant part of the vendor's total business.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. Sporting goods store sells one power cruiser during the calendar year. The sale is taxable.</p>
                  <p>C. Sales that constitute an integral part of a business even though the sale of such tangible personal property is not the primary business of the seller (as the sale of repossessed property by a finance company).</p>
                  <p>D. The sale of by-products, waste, scrap, and other obsolete and used equipment by a person engaged in a business, when sales are regularly made to employees or to the public to dispose of these items.</p>

                  <p>A. The sale of tangible personal property primarily used in a trade or business is exempt if the sale is not made in the normal course of business of selling such property; the sale occurs in a transaction subject to, or described in, section 118, 331, 332, 336, 337, 338, 351, 355, 368, 721, 731, 1031, or 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the following conditions are met:</p>
                  <p>(1) the sale must qualify, as well as be reported, as a transaction occurring under one of the Internal Revenue Code sections listed in this item; and</p>
                  <p>(2) the transfer must be between partnerships and their partners or between corporations and their shareholders or, if the sale is under section 1563(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, between members of a controlled group.</p>
                  <p>B. Limited liability companies are generally treated as either corporations or partnerships for federal income tax purposes and transfers between limited liability companies and their members are covered by one of the Internal Revenue Code sections listed in Item A. Single member limited liability companies that elect to be treated as a corporation are also covered by one or more of the Internal Revenue Code sections listed in item A. However, when a single member limited liability company does not elect to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the limited liability company is neither a partnership nor a corporation and transfers between the limited liability company and its one member are not exempt from sales tax under this subpart.</p>

                  <p>A. The sale of tangible personal property primarily used in a trade or business is exempt if the sale is not made in the normal course of business of selling such property and the sale is a sale of substantially all of the assets of a trade or business, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25, paragraph (b), clause (3), and as defined in subpart 1a, item F. A buyer of property is not subject to use tax if the buyer has a written statement from the seller confirming that the sale of the property is a sale of substantially all of the assets of the business, as defined in subpart 1a. If the buyer has a written statement from the seller to that effect and the seller does not sell substantially all of the assets of the trade or business, the seller is subject to tax on the total amount received.</p>
                  <p>B. Under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25, paragraph (b), clause (3), the sale of substantially all of the assets has to take place within the period of 12 months. This means that the seller must sell 90 percent or more of the total fair market value of tangible personal property within the 12-month period in order to be exempt from tax.</p>

                  <p>The sale of tangible personal property primarily used in a trade or business is exempt if the sale is not made in the normal course of business of selling such property and the total amount of gross receipts from the sale of trade or business property made during the calendar month of the sale, as well as sales of property made in the previous 11 months, does not exceed $1,000, as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25, paragraph (a), clause (6). A buyer of property is not subject to use tax if the buyer has a written statement from the seller confirming that the sale of the property meets this requirement. In this case, if the seller sells property for an amount exceeding $1,000, the seller is subject to tax on the total amount received, including the first $1,000. The limitation of $1,000 does not apply when the business sells substantially all of its assets.</p>
                  <p>Example. A company sells some cabinets and desks for $12,000 during a period of 12 months but it is not a sale of substantially all the assets of the business. The sale of these fixtures does not qualify for the exemption since the amount received exceeds $1,000.</p>

                  <p>Example. The following farming equipment is sold at a farm auction: tools, lawn mowers, and other supplies. A neighboring home improvement business sells patio furniture at the farm auction and the auction also includes personal items owned by various individuals. The farming equipment and the personal items consist of 95 percent of the fair market value of the items sold; the home improvement inventory consists of five percent of the items sold. The farming equipment and the personal items are exempt. The items sold by the home improvement business are subject to tax.</p>

                  <p>A "garage sale or personal sale" is a sale by a person or persons selling their personal belongings. A garage sale or personal sale does not include flea markets, craft shows, antique shows, coin shows, stamp shows, comic book shows, convention exhibit areas, or similar selling events, as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.87. A garage sale includes moving sales, estate sales, and other similar sales. If a person does not regularly hold garage sales or personal sales and the items sold have not been collected or purchased for the purpose of resale, the sales are isolated or occasional. A person who collects or purchases items for resale is deemed to be in business, and must obtain a sales and use tax permit and collect and remit tax on sales of taxable items.</p>
                  <p>If any trade or business assets are sold at the garage sale, sales tax is due on those items.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. A person sells personal belongings at an annual neighborhood garage sale that was advertised through word-of-mouth, notices on a bulletin board, or an advertisement in the classified section of a newspaper. No sales tax applies.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. A person sells new or used items that were purchased for the purpose of resale, as well as personal items, at a garage sale. The personal items include some children's toys and a lamp. The person is considered to be carrying on a trade or business and sales tax must be charged on all sales of taxable items that were purchased for resale. The sale of the lamp and the toys is not subject to tax.</p>

                  <p>A. For purposes of this part, an auction is a method of selling tangible personal property in a public forum through open and competitive bidding conducted by an auctioneer licensed under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 330. An auction does not include a consignment auction or consignment sale, as defined in subpart 10.</p>
                  <p>B. The sale of items held in inventory, taxable services, and property primarily used in a trade or business is generally subject to tax, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25.</p>
                  <p>C. When tangible personal property is sold in an auction, the sale qualifies as an isolated or occasional sale under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 23, if it would qualify as an isolated or occasional sale when sold by the owner of the property, and if the following conditions are met:</p>
                  <p>(1) the title is exchanged directly between the owner and the buyer;</p>
                  <p>(2) the auctioneer does not carry insurance on the property; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the auctioneer and the owner of the property to be sold have entered a written agreement as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 330.10.</p>
                  <p>D. When the sale is taxable, the person receiving the payment is responsible for collecting and remitting the sales tax on the total sales price of the property.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. An auctioneer conducts an estate sale and sells personal belongings of the deceased person. No tax is due if the conditions provided under this subpart are met.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. An auctioneer purchases 50 tires from an individual. The tires are auctioned to the general public. The sale is subject to tax since the auctioneer took title of the tires and, therefore, is considered to be selling the tires in the normal course of business.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. An insurance company contracts with an auctioneer to sell its used office furniture at an annual auction. The items sold are subject to tax, unless the sales meet the exceptions provided in subparts 3a to 3d. The insurance company is a business and thus Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 23, does not apply.</p>

                  <p>A. For purposes of this part, a broker is a person who sells tangible personal property owned by others and who receives a fee or a commission for selling the owner's property. A broker is not an auctioneer.</p>
                  <p>B. The sale of items held in inventory, taxable services, and property primarily used in a trade or business is generally subject to tax, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25.</p>
                  <p>C. When tangible personal property is sold by a broker, the sale qualifies as an isolated or occasional sale under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.67, subdivision 23, if it would qualify as an isolated or occasional sale when sold by the owner of the property, and the following conditions are met:</p>
                  <p>(1) the title to the property passes directly from the owner to the buyer;</p>
                  <p>(2) the payment does not pass through any accounts of the broker;</p>
                  <p>(3) the broker does not carry insurance on the property; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the rights to accept or reject any offer are retained by the owner.</p>
                  <p>D. When the sale is taxable, the person receiving the payment is responsible for collecting and remitting the sales tax on the total sales price of the property.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. The owner of a boat marina sells a boat on behalf of a boat owner who is not in the trade or business of selling boats. The marina owner advertises the boat for sale and obtains offers to purchase the boat. The marina owner informs the buyer of the offers. The boat owner retains the power to accept or reject the offers. Title to the boat passes directly from the owner to the buyer. Payment is made directly to the owner. Upon sale of the boat, the marina owner receives a commission from the seller. This sale is exempt from tax.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. A boat marina negotiates the sale of a boat for the owner of a boat. The owner has no involvement in the negotiation of the sale. Payment for the boat is deposited in the marina's account. The sale is subject to tax.</p>

                  <p>A. For purposes of this part, consignment sales are sales in which a retailer maintains a place of business where tangible personal property owned by others is sold by the retailer in the normal course of business. The retailer may also sell property owned by the retailer. A consignment sale is not an auction, as defined in subpart 8.</p>
                  <p>B. Consignment auctions are events that are regularly scheduled, are open to members of the public to sell their items, and are held at the same location. Consignment auctions are not selling events, as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.87. Consignment auctions are not auctions, as defined in subpart 8.</p>
                  <p>C. The sale of items held in inventory, taxable services, and property primarily used in a trade or business is generally subject to tax, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25.</p>
                  <p>D. Consignment sales and consignment auctions are exempt from tax if:</p>
                  <p>(1) the title to the property passes directly from the owner to the buyer;</p>
                  <p>(2) the payment does not pass through any accounts of the retailer or auctioneer;</p>
                  <p>(3) the retailer or auctioneer does not carry insurance on the property; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the rights to accept or reject any offer are retained by the owner.</p>
                  <p>E. When the sale is taxable, the person receiving the payment is responsible for collecting and remitting the sales tax on the total sales price of the property.</p>
                  <p>Example 1. A person sells used books on consignment at a retail store. Under the contract, the store determines the selling price of the books. The sale is taxable.</p>
                  <p>Example 2. A person sells a lawn mower at a consignment auction. Title passes from the owner directly to the buyer. Payment is deposited in the auction company's books. The company deducts its fee and then pays the owner a share of the payment. The sale is subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>Example 3. A person rents space from the operator of a craft show to sell craft items. The seller participates in the event for four days. The sales at the show are taxable since the selling event lasts more than three days, as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.87, subdivision 3.</p>

                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 4, exempts from sales and use tax the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property to, and storage, use, or other consumption of such property by, any corporation, society, association, foundation, or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, or educational purposes if the property purchased is to be used in the performance of charitable, religious, or educational functions.</p>
                  <p>No part of the net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholders.</p>
                  <p>Sales of telecommunications services under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (i); electricity, gas, water, or steam pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (e); and admission to places of amusement, recreational areas, or athletic events and the use of amusement devices and athletic or other facilities as provided for in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (g), clause (1), are included in this exemption.</p>
                  <p>This exemption does not apply to the following sales or purchases:</p>
                  <p>A. Building, construction, or reconstruction materials purchased by a contractor or a subcontractor as a part of a lump-sum contract or similar type of contract with a guaranteed maximum price covering both labor and materials for use in the construction, alteration, or repair of a building or facility.</p>
                  <p>B. Construction materials purchased by exempt organizations or their contractors to be used in constructing buildings or facilities which will not be used principally by the exempt organizations.</p>
                  <p>C. Lease or purchase of a motor vehicle, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297B.01, subdivision 11, unless the lease or purchase meets the requirements for exemption under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 4, paragraph (c), or 297B.03, clause (11).</p>
                  <p>For purposes of this part, charitable, religious, or educational purposes are referred to as "exempt purposes," and a nonprofit organization, society, association, foundation, or institution organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes are referred to as an "exempt organization."</p>

                  <p>A. For purposes of this part, "buildings or facilities which will not be used principally by an exempt organization" means buildings or facilities that will be used by the exempt organization for commercial purposes and not to carry out their exempt functions. For example, construction materials purchased by an exempt organization to be used in constructing a building which the exempt organization will lease to another is not used principally by an exempt organization even though the lease payments may be used for an exempt purpose.</p>
                  <p>B. Materials that are purchased by an exempt organization for use in the performance of its exempt function are included in the exemption under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 4. For example, construction materials purchased by an exempt organization for use in its program to weatherize homes for low-income persons may be purchased exempt by an exempt organization.</p>
                  <p>C. Unless the sale is specifically exempt under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.71, the exemption from tax under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 4, does not extend to building, construction, or reconstruction materials purchased by a contractor under an agreement to erect a building or to alter, repair, or improve real estate for an exempt organization, even if the work contracted for is for use in the performance of the exempt organization's exempt function.

                  <p>"Charitable" is used in its generally accepted legal sense to mean a gift, to be applied consistently with existing laws, for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons. Charitable includes relief of the poor, underprivileged, and distressed, the care of the sick, the infirm, or the aged; the erection or maintaining of public buildings and monuments; lessening of the burdens of government; lessening of neighborhood tensions; elimination of prejudice and discrimination; defense of human and civil rights secured by law; providing of qualified low-income housing to qualified persons; and combating of community deterioration and juvenile delinquency. To determine whether an organization qualifies for the charitable exemption, the factors in items A to F will be considered. Each case must be decided on its own particular facts, and it is not essential that every factor mentioned in items A to F be present for an organization to qualify as a charitable organization.</p>
                  <p>A. whether the stated purpose of the undertaking is to be helpful to others without immediate expectation of material reward;</p>
                  <p>B. whether the entity involved is supported by donations and gifts in whole or in part;</p>
                  <p>C. whether the recipients of the "charity" are required to pay for the assistance received in whole or in part;</p>
                  <p>D. whether the income received from gifts and donations and charges to users produces a profit to the charitable institutions;</p>
                  <p>E. whether the beneficiaries of the "charity" are restricted or unrestricted and, if restricted, whether the class of persons to whom the charity is available is one having a reasonable relationship to the charitable objectives;</p>
                  <p>F. whether the dividends, in form or substance, or assets upon dissolution are available to private interests.</p>

                  <p>"Religious" refers to an institution that conducts worship services at regular intervals at an established place of worship that is owned, leased, or borrowed for that purpose, and organizations affiliated with or related to that institution, which exist exclusively for the furtherance of the religious purposes of the institution. The specific merits of a particular religion will not be compared or considered by the department when determining whether an organization is an exempt religious organization for purposes of the Minnesota sales and use tax. An organization claiming exempt status as a religious organization must be able to affirmatively establish its right to the exemption. Only if an organization clearly demonstrates that it is an organization created exclusively for religious purposes will it meet the requirements for tax-exempt status under Minnesota sales and use tax statutes. The criteria the department will use to determine whether an organization is a religious organization includes the criteria in items A to N. Each case must be decided on its own particular facts and it is not essential that every factor mentioned in items A to N be present for an organization to qualify as a religious organization.</p>
                  <p>A. a distinct legal existence;</p>
                  <p>B. a recognized creed and form of worship;</p>

                  <p>E. a distinct religious history;</p>
                  <p>F. a membership not associated with any other church or denomination;</p>

                  <p>"Educational" means the instruction or training of individuals to improve or develop their capabilities, or the instruction of the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community. Examples of educational institutions are primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, and nonprofit professional and trade schools having a regularly scheduled curriculum, a regular faculty, and a regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at a place where the educational activities are regularly carried on. Educational organizations include PTA, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, YMCA, YWCA, 4-H Clubs, and youth athletic and recreational programs such as Little League. Other educational institutions include museums, zoos, planetariums, symphony orchestras, historical societies, and other similar organizations.</p>
                  <p>An organization may be educational even though it advocates a particular position or viewpoint, so long as it presents a sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts as to permit an individual or the public to form an independent opinion or conclusion.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">5</inline>. <b>Organization and operational tests.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>An organization is not exempt as a charitable, religious, or educational organization for sales and use tax purposes unless it is exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 22. However, the determination of the Internal Revenue Service that an organization is a nonprofit and tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code, section 501(c)(3), for purposes of income taxation is not controlling on the issue of whether the organization is an exempt organization for sales and use tax purposes. Likewise, determinations by the Minnesota Department of Revenue that an organization is an exempt organization for income tax purposes does not, by itself, entitle the organization to an exemption from payment of sales and use tax. In order to be an exempt organization, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes. The following tests will be used in determining whether or not an organization qualifies as an exempt organization:</p>
                  <p>A. An exempt organization may not be organized or operated for the purpose of making a profit which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. The organization must be able to demonstrate by its articles of incorporation or if unincorporated, a certified copy of its constitution and bylaws, and its financial statements that:</p>
                  <p>(1) no part of the net earnings of its activities inures to the benefit of any private shareholder, or individual member, and no part of its assets will directly or indirectly be transferred, in the event of dissolution of a corporation or termination of an unincorporated association, to its members, founders, or shareholders;</p>
                  <p>(2) it is supported and maintained at least in part by gifts, grants, and contributions, that is, one of its sources of support is donations, income from donations, and contributions and dues of members for which they receive no direct benefit, or it is supported by fees charged by an exempt organization for program services if the fees are based on ability to pay and the exempt organization provides services to individuals who would otherwise turn to government for such aid. "Program services" means those activities that the exempt organization was created to conduct and which, along with any activities commenced subsequently, form the basis of the organization's current exemption from tax.</p>
                  <p>The fact that an organization may receive voluntary contributions from those who benefit from its activities will not necessarily prevent its being an exempt organization. But if it is determined that the services rendered by the organization are conditioned upon the receipt of a contribution the services rendered may be regarded as a commercial activity. If this commercial activity is not subordinate to or incidental to the organization's charitable, religious, or educational activities, the organization does not qualify as an exempt organization since it is not organized or operated exclusively for exempt purposes.</p>
                  <p>The fact that an organization is nonprofit does not necessarily make it an exempt organization. The following are examples of nonprofit organizations that may not qualify for exemption: organizations attempting to influence legislation or participating in political campaigns; fraternal or beneficial societies; clubs organized and operated for pleasure, recreation, social, or other similar purposes; business associations; cemetery associations that are not owned by religious organizations; civic and business clubs; homeowner's associations; lake improvement associations; professional and trade associations; retail and credit trade associations; trade unions; volunteer employee benefit associations; and veterans organizations. Thus, such organizations as Masons, Knights of Columbus, B'nai B'rith, League of Women Voters, Chambers of Commerce, American Legion, alumni clubs, computer clubs, fraternities and sororities, Jaycees, Lions Clubs, Odd Fellows, Orders of Eastern Star, ski clubs, unions, and VFW Posts are not exempt organizations.</p>
                  <p>B. If an organization, by the terms of its articles, has purposes that are broader than the exempt purposes specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 4, the fact that its actual operations have been exclusively in furtherance of exempt purposes is not sufficient to make it an exempt organization. Similarly, an organization that is organized exclusively for exempt purposes is not an exempt organization if a significant part of its operations are not in furtherance of its exempt purposes.</p>
                  <p>C. An organization is not an exempt organization if its attempts to influence legislation or intervene or participate in a political campaign (including the publishing or distributing of statements) cause it to lose its exemption from income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 22.</p>
                  <p>D. An exempt organization must serve a public rather than a private interest. Thus, to gain exemption an organization must establish that it is not organized or operated for the benefit of private interests such as designated individuals, the founder or organizer or their family, shareholders of the organization, or persons controlled directly or indirectly by such private interests. An organization which is organized or operated primarily for the benefit of its individual nonexempt members rather than for the benefit of the general welfare does not qualify for exemption.</p>
                  <p>E. The assets of an exempt organization must be dedicated to an exempt purpose. An organization is not an exempt organization if its net earnings are used in whole or in part to the benefit of shareholders or individuals who have a personal or private interest in the activities of the organization.</p>

Charitable and youth athletic organizations must apply for and receive an exempt status number and furnish that number when making exempt purchases of tangible personal property. Religious and educational organizations may also apply for and receive an exempt status number.</p>
                  <p>(1) Organizations that may furnish a certificate without an exempt status number include churches, schools, and educational organizations such as scouts, 4-H Clubs, YMCAs, YWCAs, and PTAs.</p>
                  <p>(2) Organizations that must furnish a certificate that includes an exempt status number include charitable organizations such as hospitals, nursing homes, day activity centers, United Way agencies, senior citizen groups, and youth athletic programs such as Little League and hockey.</p>
                  <p>B. An application for certificate of exempt status must be fully executed and submitted with the necessary supporting documents. No charitable organization making purchases shall be entitled to make those purchases exempt from the sales and use tax unless a certificate of exempt status has been issued by the commissioner of revenue.</p>
                  <p>C. If the department is provided information sufficient to establish that an organization is organized and operated exclusively for an exempt purpose, exemption will be granted to the organization regardless of the purpose indicated in its application for certificate of exempt status. For example, if an organization claims exemption on the grounds that it is educational, exemption will not be denied if it is, in fact, charitable.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">8</inline>. <b>Taxable sales to exempt organizations.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Certain sales and rentals to exempt organizations remain taxable. Exempt organizations still owe the sales tax when purchasing motor vehicles or when renting motor vehicles. See subpart 1. Sales to exempt organizations are taxable if the items purchased are not used in the performance of the charitable, religious, or educational functions of the exempt organization. The benefits of tax-exempt status are confined strictly to the legal entity that has qualified for such status. Thus, sales to individuals who are affiliated with an exempt organization are taxable even if the sales would be exempt if made directly to the exempt organization.</p>
                  <p>Items A to D are examples of taxable sales.</p>
                  <p>A. Sales of all lawful gambling equipment and supplies to any organization conducting gambling activities in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, chapter 349, since this property is not used in the performance of exempt functions.</p>
                  <p>B. Furniture purchased by a church for use in its parsonage is exempt since it is purchased for use by persons that administer religious activities to the congregation. These items are not purchased for the personal use of any one specific person but rather for the operation of a religious organization.</p>
                  <p>C. Handbooks, leaders' workbooks, and camping equipment purchased by a Girl Scout troop in its own name and with troop funds are exempt. However, these items are taxable if sold directly to an individual scout.</p>
                  <p>D. An exempt organization buys a set of golf clubs for a retirement gift for a staff member. The golf clubs are taxable as the gift is not furthering the exempt purpose of the organization.</p>

                  <p>No organization is exempt from collecting the tax on taxable retail sales. If an exempt organization makes taxable retail sales, it must collect and remit tax on these sales unless the sales are exempt fund-raising sales that meet the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 13 or 14, or the sales are otherwise exempt under Minnesota Statutes, chapters 297A and 297E.</p>
                  <p>A. Examples of taxable sales:</p>
                  <p>(1) craft or workshop items, including those sold by hospital auxiliaries and senior citizen clubs;</p>
                  <p>(2) religious books and cards;</p>
                  <p>(3) used, obsolete, or surplus merchandise sold on a regular basis, such as surplus office equipment or used library books;</p>
                  <p>(4) prepared food;</p>
                  <p>(5) rental of personal property on a regular or recurring basis.</p>
                  <p>B. Examples of nontaxable sales:</p>
                  <p>(1) land and buildings;</p>
                  <p>(2) membership dues, retreat fees;</p>
                  <p>(3) newspapers and magazines (published at least quarterly);</p>
                  <p>(4) textbooks sold to enrolled students and prescribed for use in a course of study;</p>
                  <p>(5) tuition, including day care and nursery school charges;</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">10</inline>. <b>Volunteer fire departments.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Volunteer fire departments may qualify for exempt status if they qualify as a charitable organization and are a separate organization from the city. To be considered separate from the city, they must have either their own constitution or articles of incorporation. If a volunteer fire department has been approved for exempt status, its purchases are exempt in the manner provided in items A and B.</p>
                  <p>A. Exempt volunteer fire departments may purchase property exempt from sales tax and use tax if it is to be used exclusively to prevent fires in the community or to protect property in the community from fire. Subitems (1) to (6) are examples of items that an exempt volunteer fire department may purchase exempt:</p>
                  <p>(1) fire trucks, ambulances, and accessories;</p>
                  <p>(2) repair and replacement parts for fire trucks and ambulances;</p>
                  <p>(3) fire protection clothing;</p>
                  <p>(4) hand tools;</p>
                  <p>(5) conversion equipment installed on an existing fire truck if the equipment purchased is used for the prevention of or protection from fire of property in the community;</p>
                  <p>(6) water used to fill pumper fire trucks. The organization must be able to determine the amount of water that is used for general purposes if water from the station house is used. If the amount of water used for general purposes cannot be determined, the entire amount is taxable. If the amount of exempt water can be determined, the fire department could purchase all its water exempt from the sales tax and report use tax on the portion used for general purposes or it could file a statement with the seller claiming a partial exemption. This statement must certify:</p>
                  <p>(a) they are a volunteer fire department;</p>
                  <p>(b) the percentage of water that is used to fill pumper fire trucks; and</p>
                  <p>(c) a statement describing how this percentage was determined. The seller should exempt the portion claimed and charge sales tax on the remaining charge for water purchased.</p>
                  <p>B. Purchases made by an exempt volunteer fire department that are not used exclusively to prevent fires in the community or to protect property in the community from fire are taxable. For example, a washing machine used to wash fire protection clothing is taxable.</p>

                  <p>A. Many senior citizen groups are exempt from the sales and use tax. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), clause (2).</p>
                  <p>B. Sales of tangible personal property to veterans organizations or their auxiliaries are exempt provided the property is used for charitable, civic, educational, or nonprofit uses and the organization is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 501(c), clause 19, of the Internal Revenue Code. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 5.</p>
                  <p>C. Sales of sacramental wine for sacramental purposes in religious ceremonies are exempt if the wine is purchased from a nonprofit religious organization or a person authorized to import sacramental wine without a license. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 9.</p>
                  <p>D. Fees to camps or other recreation facilities are exempt if they are owned and operated by an exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 22, and are used for (i) services primarily for children, adults accompanying children, or persons with disabilities, or (ii) educational or religious activities. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 16. The sale of memberships to an association incorporated under Minnesota Statutes, section 315.44 (YMCAs and YWCAs), or an organization defined in section 315.51 (JCCs), are exempt. This includes onetime initiation fees and periodic membership dues. All separate charges for the privilege of having access to and the use of the association's sports and athletic facilities are taxable. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 12.</p>
                  <p>E. While purchases of admissions provided for in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (g), clause (1), are exempt when purchased by exempt organizations, sales of admissions by exempt organizations are generally taxable. The following sales of admissions in subitems (1) and (2) are exempt.</p>
                  <p>(1) Tickets or admission to artistic performances sponsored by qualified tax-exempt organizations are exempt. This exemption includes sales of tickets or admission by public schools, private schools, colleges, and universities for concerts, plays, and similar artistic events sponsored by the schools if the events are held at facilities owned by the schools and the performance and the organization meet the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 10. See also Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.96.</p>
                  <p>(2) Tickets or admission to regular season school games, events, and activities are exempt. Tickets or admissions to games, events, and activities sponsored by the Minnesota State High School League are exempt after June 30, 2006, and before July 1, 2011. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.70, subdivision 11.</p>
                  <p>F. Receipts from bingo, raffles, and other gambling activities are subject to the tax imposed on lawful gambling. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297E.02.</p>
                  <p>G. A nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal income taxation under subchapter F of the Internal Revenue Code is not considered to be a trade or business. Therefore, sales of items previously used in the operation of the exempt organization may still qualify for the isolated or occasional sale exemption. However, if an exempt organization operates a trade or business that has little or no relationship to its exempt purposes except to provide funds to carry out those purposes, these activities are considered to be a trade or business. In these instances, the sale of any equipment sold in connection with the trade or business operated by an exempt organization is taxable. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 25.</p>

                  <p>Treatment:</p>
                  <p>A. Sales of tombstones, markers, or other memorials and the foundation upon which such tombstones, markers, and other memorials are placed, including the material used in setting the memorials in the cemetery, are considered sales of tangible personal property, and subject to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Memorial dealers are the retailers of such property. The tax applies to the entire amount charged, without deduction for the production cost of cutting, shaping, polishing, or lettering the memorial. However, charges for inscriptions upon a stone subsequent to its erection, constitute receipts from personal services, which, if stated separately, are deductible from the total charge.</p>
                  <p>B. If the seller agrees to install the memorial in a cemetery, the charge for transporting the memorial to the cemetery and for the labor of setting the memorial in the cemetery are included in the sales price and are taxable.</p>
                  <p>C. If a cemetery constructs the foundation upon which a memorial is to be placed, and collects the charges from the memorial dealer, who then either collects that amount as a separate charge from a customer or includes it in the total charge for the memorial, the memorial dealer is the retailer of the foundation and must collect and remit the tax on the charges made therefor. The cemetery, under such circumstances, is merely acting for the memorial dealer.</p>
                  <p>D. If the cemetery collects the charges for foundations directly from customers of the memorial dealer, the cemetery is the retailer and must collect and remit the tax with respect to the charges made for the completed foundation.</p>
                  <p>E. Sales to memorial dealers and cemeteries of materials, including sand, gravel, cement, and supplies, which are used in the processing of tombstones, markers, or other memorials, and the erection of foundations on which finished tombstones, markers, or other memorials are placed, and which become component parts thereof, are exempt as sales used in industrial production. Sales to memorial dealers and cemeteries of tools, equipment, and supplies which do not become component parts of finished foundations, tombstones, markers, or other memorials are taxable. (See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 2).</p>

                  <p>B. When the completed VA form 21-4502 or VA form 10-1394 and copies of the seller's invoices are furnished to the Veterans Administration, the appropriate Veterans Administration official will stamp and sign one copy of the seller's invoice certifying that the purchase was made under the provisions of United States Code, title 38, section 1901, as amended, and return it to the seller with the check in payment of the allowable amount. The seller should keep the copy of the invoice for the seller's records, to verify that the sale was properly exempt.</p>

                  <p>Ordinarily, a deduction for uncollectible debts is allowed only for a person who is reporting on the accrual method of accounting for sales and use tax purposes. However, if a cash basis taxpayer accepts an unsecured check in payment for a sale, reports the sale, and subsequently determines that the check is uncollectible, the taxpayer is entitled to an uncollectible debt deduction. In addition, a certified service provider may claim a bad debt allowance on behalf of the provider's client. Uncollectible debts (commonly referred to as bad debts) will be recognized as a deduction for sales tax purposes only when given recognition by a direct charge-off for federal income tax purposes or, if the retailer is not required to file income tax returns, charged off in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, no anticipatory or statistical method of estimating future uncollectible debts will be allowed by the commissioner. See Minnesota Statutes, sections 289A.50, subdivision 2b, and 297A.81.</p>

                  <p>If a debt becomes uncollectible, either in whole or in part, in a reporting period subsequent to the period in which the transaction that gave rise to the uncollectible debt occurred, the retailer may deduct the uncollectible debt from the gross receipts for the reporting period in which the uncollectible debt is determined to be uncollectible in accordance with the following rules.</p>
                  <p>A. If the uncollectible debt arose in respect of a sale required to be included in gross receipts, subject to a tax imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Law, the entire amount of the debt remaining uncollected is allowed as a deduction.</p>
                  <p>B. If the uncollectible debt arose in respect of a sale partly subject to the tax imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Law and partly exempt thereunder, the amount of the uncollectible debt allowed as a deduction is the amount derived by multiplying the uncollectible debt by the percentage that the taxable sale bears to the total sales.</p>
                  <p>C. If the uncollectible debt arose in respect of two or more sales made at successive intervals, payments made before the date the debt became uncollectible must be applied, first to the earliest sale upon which there is an unpaid balance, and to following sales in successive order.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">8</inline>. <b>Electronic data processing records.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>"Electronic data processing records" include punched cards, magnetic tapes, magnetic disk packs, computer disks, and other machine-sensible data media used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting transactions and records within a taxpayer's electronic data processing system. These records are required to be retained so long as their contents may be material in the administration of any provision of the Sales and Use Tax Law. The commissioner shall decide the materiality of any such records, and if the materiality of any record is questionable, then the record must be retained. It is not required that taxpayers retain the same data on two or more machine-sensible media. If there is a duplication of data between two or more electronic data processing media, the taxpayer must maintain a complete set of all the records on at least one of the media.</p>
                  <p>These requirements apply to any taxpayer who maintains any records on an electronic data processing media. The records to be maintained are as follows.</p>
                  <p>A. A general ledger, with source references, to coincide with financial reports for sales tax reporting periods. In cases where subsidiary ledgers are used to support the general ledger accounts, the subsidiary ledgers must be maintained.</p>
                  <p>B. Invoices, vouchers, and other records which support the summary accounting data. There records must be identified and made available to the department upon request.</p>
                  <p>C. The records which provide the opportunity to trace any transaction back to the original source or forward to a final total. If printouts are not made at the time of processing, then the system must have the ability to reconstruct these transactions.</p>
                  <p>D. A general description or documentation of the electronic data processing portion of the accounting system. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(1) standard programming conventions and procedures including flowcharting conventions, decision table conventions, coding conventions, standard glossary and standard abbreviations, standard programming techniques, and debugging procedures and techniques;</p>
                  <p>(2) documentation of the system including a problem statement, systems flowcharts, operator instructions, record layouts, program flowcharts and sense switches, program listings, test data, and approval and changes log; and</p>
                  <p>(3) standard operating procedures and control procedures, including the reconciliation of electronic data processing controls to nonelectronic data processing controls, error listings and error logs, and any other controls, either electronic data processing or manual, used to ensure accurate and reliable processing.</p>
                  <p>Any taxpayer retaining disbursement or revenue records on electronic data processing records for any individual original transactions, or any summary of the transactions subject to the tax under the provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Law must separately show the amount of sales tax paid or the amount of sales tax collected. It is permissible, however, to group all taxable sales or all taxable purchases into various accounts, all of which are taxable, providing that if a nontaxable transaction is combined with a taxable transaction in the same account, then, with respect to each individual transaction, the tax is separately shown in the electronic data processing record.</p>
                  <p>An electronic data processing system must include a method of producing visible and legible paper records from the electronic data processing records which will provide the necessary information for verification of the taxpayer's tax liability.</p>
                  <p>Production of these paper records does not eliminate the necessity of maintaining the corresponding electronic data processing records as required by the first paragraph of this subpart.</p>

                  <p>Conditions to be met before the commissioner will entertain a claim for refund:</p>
                  <p>A. The person filing a claim for refund must have paid the tax and filed the sales and use tax return upon which the claim is based directly to the commissioner (or the tax was collected from such person other than by means of court action in district court, either at law or in equity by the commissioner), except the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) A person who has paid tax on electricity used in agricultural production that is exempt from taxation under Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9, may file a claim for refund with the commissioner if the tax was paid to the retail rural electric cooperative association based in Aitkin County. See Laws of Minnesota 1986, chapter 399, article 1, section 5.</p>
                  <p>(2) A disabled veteran who purchases building materials or on whose behalf a contractor, subcontractor, or builder purchases building materials for use in the construction or remodeling of the veteran's residence, when the construction or remodeling is financed in whole or in part by the United States in accordance with United States Code, title 38, sections 801 to 805, as amended, may claim a refund directly from the commissioner. A veterans's claim for refund form is available upon request from the Department of Revenue for use by disabled veterans in making claims. See part 8130.6400, and Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 20.</p>
                  <p>(3) Since July 1, 1984, the sales and use tax on capital equipment is initially paid at the six percent rate. In order to obtain the refund of sales and use tax paid on the purchases of qualifying capital equipment, the purchaser must file a claim for refund form with the commissioner. The claim is filed with the Business Trust Tax Unit, Department of Revenue. No adjustment for the tax paid on capital equipment will be allowed as credit against tax due on current sales and use tax returns being filed by a Minnesota sales and use tax permit holder.</p>
                  <p>Refund claims may include more than one purchase of machinery or equipment. However, no more than two claims will be accepted from a purchaser in a calendar year. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.15, subdivision 5.</p>
                  <p>Interest on capital equipment refunds or credits begins to accrue on the date the claim is filed. See Minnesota Statutes, section 289A.56, subdivision 4. For purposes of calculating the interest due, a claim is not considered filed until sufficient documentation to process the claim is submitted to the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>When filing a claim for refund for purchases of qualifying capital equipment, the purchaser must provide sufficient documentation to substantiate the allowance of the requested refund. The following information must be submitted with the completed claim for refund form:</p>
                  <p>(a) a Minnesota tax identification number or, if none, the purchaser's social security number;</p>
                  <p>(b) a description of the business activity including an explanation of the circumstances (for example, opening a new production facility, expansion of an existing facility, or whether or not the equipment purchased replaces existing equipment) under which the claim is filed;</p>
                  <p>(c) a description of the property purchased and how it will be used in the production process;</p>
                  <p>(d) a copy of the purchase invoice for each equipment purchase and written evidence of payment of the six percent tax or such other evidence as the commissioner deems necessary;</p>
                  <p>(e) for leased equipment, a copy of the invoice showing sales tax paid on the lease payments and a copy of the lease agreement; and</p>
                  <p>(f) if a use tax was accrued and reported for the equipment purchase, verification that the use tax was reported to the state of Minnesota, including evidence of payment of the six percent tax.</p>
                  <p>(4) The owner of homestead property may file a refund claim directly with the commissioner if a chair lift, ramp, or elevator was installed or constructed on the owner's homestead pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 43.</p>
                  <p>(5) A common carrier that has applied for a direct pay certificate under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.211, may file a claim for refund of tax previously paid to a seller. This refund will be calculated according to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.211, subdivision 3, and interest will be calculated according to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 289A.56, subdivision 5.</p>
                  <p>B. A claim for refund must be filed within two years after the tax was paid in full, or within three and one-half years from the date prescribed for filing the return, whichever period expires later. See Minnesota Statutes, section 289A.40, subdivision 1. If the commissioner and the claimant have consented to extend the time for assessment of tax under Minnesota Statutes, section 289A.42, subdivision 1, the claim may be filed within the extended period. For purposes of ascertaining whether a claim for refund is timely filed with the commissioner, a return filed before the date on which the return was due will be determined to have been filed on the date when due. A return postmarked on the date due will be determined to have been filed as of that date.</p>
                  <p>C. A claim filed by a corporation must bear the signatures and titles of the officers having the authority to sign for the corporation.</p>
                  <p>Whenever it is necessary to have the claim executed by an attorney or agent on behalf of the claimant, an original, executed power of attorney specifically authorizing the agent or attorney to sign the claim on behalf of the claimant must accompany the claim.</p>
                  <p>If a return is filed by a person who dies after filing a return, and a refund claim is filed by a legal representative of the decedent, certified copies of the letters testamentary, letters of administration, or other similar evidence must be filed with the claim to show the authority of the executor, administrator, or other fiduciary by whom the claim is filed. If an executor, administrator, or other fiduciary files a return and thereafter a refund claim is filed by the same fiduciary, documentary evidence to establish the legal authority of the fiduciary need not accompany the claim, provided a statement is made on the claim showing the return was filed by the fiduciary and that the latter is still acting in such capacity.</p>
                  <p>If a vendor has collected from a purchaser and remitted to the state a tax on a transaction that is not subject to tax under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 297A, the tax, and any interest earned on the tax, is refundable to the vendor only if and to the extent that the vendor submits written evidence that the tax and interest will be returned by the vendor to the purchaser or credited to amounts due to the vendor by the purchaser.</p>

                  <p>Action taken by the commissioner after a claim for refund is filed:</p>
                  <p>A. Upon receipt of a claim for refund, the commissioner will examine the return and make any investigation or examination of any of the accounts and records pertaining to the claim that the commissioner considers necessary. The commissioner will then prepare written findings, either denying or allowing the claim, in whole or in part, and will mail a notice to the person filing the claim at the address stated on the return or to any other address furnished by the claimant in writing.</p>
                  <p>B. The amount allowed by the commissioner as a refund is first applied against any sales or use tax owed to the commissioner by the claimant, and any remaining balance due the claimant may be applied against any other delinquent tax liability owed by the claimant. Interest will be computed on the amounts refunded or credited from the date of overpayment to the date when the refund or credit is authorized by the commissioner, except for capital equipment claims and claims pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 43. See Minnesota Statutes, sections 289A.56, subdivision 4, and 297A.15, subdivisions 5 and 6.</p>
                  <p>The interest rate on overpayments will be the interest rate that the commissioner establishes under Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.40, subdivision 5, to be charged on unpaid taxes. The interest rate will be adjusted annually and will become effective annually when the interest rate on unpaid taxes changes. See Minnesota Statutes, sections 270C.405 and 289A.56, subdivision 1.</p>
                  <p>C. If a claim for refund made by a vendor is based upon overpayment of sales tax by a purchaser to the vendor, the commissioner, for purposes of ascertaining the validity of the claim, may request substantiation of the overpayment by the purchaser, or examine the purchaser's records. If the commissioner is unable to establish the validity of the overpayment after conducting an examination of the purchaser's records, the commissioner will deny the claim.</p>

                  <p>The veterinarian is primarily engaged in the business of rendering professional services to the owners of animals, through care, medication, and treatment of such animals. The veterinarian is the user and consumer of all tangible personal property such as drugs, medicines, bandages and dressings, serums, tonics, and vitamins used in connection with the performance of services unless the veterinarian bills the customer separately for the services rendered and the materials used in the course of rendering such services. Except for the agricultural production exemptions provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.69, and except as provided otherwise in this part, the veterinarian must pay sales or use tax on items used to provide services and must collect and report sales tax on retail sales of taxable goods and services.</p>

                  <p>Retail sales by the veterinarian of tangible personal property and taxable services that are not used or consumed in agricultural production or are not used to provide a taxable service are taxable. For example, worm pills sold for treatment of the family pet dog would be taxable. The veterinarian may accept exemption certificates from persons engaged in agricultural production, or in the boarding, breeding, raising, owning, or keeping of horses, or in providing taxable services such as pet grooming or the furnishing of lodging, board, and care services for animals, for retail sales of items that are used or consumed in those endeavors.</p>

                  <p>If the veterinarian administers a drug, medicine, or supply to an animal other than an agricultural production animal or horse and merely charges for services and absorbs the cost of drugs and other materials in a service charge, no tax should be charged by the veterinarian. The veterinarian is the consumer of such drugs and materials and the sale of the drugs or material by the supplier to the veterinarian is a taxable retail sale. If the veterinarian both sells a drug, medicine, or supply and administers it to an animal other than an agricultural production animal or horse, and also separately states the charges for such items and the charge for the veterinary service, then the sale of such drugs and materials by the veterinarian is a taxable retail sale. The veterinarian may purchase these items exempt for resale and must charge tax on the sales price to the customer. "Administers" means the item is injected, fed, or applied to the animal.</p>

                  <p>Boarding and pet grooming services are taxable. Materials and supplies used or consumed in providing taxable boarding and pet grooming services are exempt. Materials and supplies are used or consumed when the materials, following their use by the veterinarian in boarding and pet grooming services, are substantially without value and of no further practical use.</p>
                  <p>A. Durable supplies and equipment used to provide these services are taxable, since following the boarding or pet grooming service they are not substantially without value and are of further practical use. Examples of durable supplies and equipment include collars, leashes, cages, grooming tables, clippers, combs, and scissors.</p>
                  <p>B. Pet grooming services include, but are not limited to, shampooing, clipping, trimming, and nail cutting. If these services are performed by a veterinarian for surgical preparation or for treating or preventing illness or disease, they are not taxable. Pet grooming services do not include grooming services for horses and horseshoeing and hoof trimming services.</p>
                  <p>C. Boarding services for horses are not taxable. For other animals, boarding services provided by a veterinarian are not taxable if the boarding service is for medical reasons - that is, hospitalization, observation, or other veterinary purposes. "Other veterinary purposes" does not include administering medication to a pet when the pet owner normally could administer the medication. If administering such medication is the sole service provided by the veterinarian aside from boarding, then the boarding service is taxable. However, if the veterinarian not only administers medication which the pet owner normally could administer, but also boards the pet for hospitalization, observation, or other veterinary purposes, then the boarding service is not taxable.</p>

Consequently, sales by them of drawings, sketches, paintings, illustrations, photographs, motion picture films, audio and video tapes, negatives, transparencies, mats, plates, engravings, designs, lettering, signs, show cards, posters, assemblies (key lining and paste-ups), and all other forms of tangible personal property are subject to the sales and use tax, whether or not the materials utilized are furnished by the customer. The tax applies to the total price charged, including amounts attributable to personal services of models, assistants, etc., and to preliminary art which becomes physically incorporated into finished art as for example, when the finished art is made by inking directly over a pencil sketch or drawing. Separately stated charges for preliminary art, in the form of roughs, visualizations, comprehensives, and layouts, when the preliminary art does not become physically incorporated into finished art shall be considered charges for services and not subject to tax.</p>

                  <p>Since commercial artists and photographers are engaged in the production of tangible personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail, purchases by them of items which are used or consumed in such production, whether or not the items so used become ingredients or constituent parts of the property produced, are exempt from the tax in accordance with the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.25, subdivision 9. Machinery, equipment, implements, tools, accessories, appliances, contrivances, furniture, and fixtures used in such production and fuel, electricity, gas, or steam used for space heating or lighting, are not included within this exemption.</p>
                  <p>Commercial artists and photographers are users or consumers of, and must pay tax on, materials utilized in the preparation or production of preliminary or creative art work used to display ideas to prospective customers where no contract is made for sales of finished art to the customer.</p>

                  <p>The following transactions are subject to sales or use tax:</p>
                  <p>A. Sales at retail by florists, nurseries, or other producers or vendors of flowers, wreaths, bouquets, potted plants, hospital baskets, funeral designs, seeds, nursery seedling stock, trees, shrubs, plants, sod, soil, bulbs, sand, rock, and all other floral or nursery products, whether grown by such vendors or not, are taxable sales of tangible personal property.</p>
                  <p>When a florist or nursery prepares a floral arrangement for a customer, the entire transaction is taxable, including all charges for labor and materials even if separately stated on the bill.</p>
                  <p>When a florist or nursery prepares a floral arrangement for a customer who has provided the flowers or other materials, the labor charge by the florist or nursery constitutes fabrication labor and is taxable.</p>
                  <p>B. Retailers of floral or nursery products who also perform lawn, garden, arborist, tree, bush, and shrub services must collect tax on those services. Lawn, garden, arborist, tree, bush, and shrub services are taxable pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 3, paragraph (j), clause (vi). These services are taxable even though the services are provided incident to the sale of tangible personal property.</p>
                  <p>C. Purchases of machinery, equipment, implements, tools, accessories, appliances, contrivances, furniture and fixtures, and fuel, electricity, gas, or steam used for space heating or lighting are taxable unless purchased for resale.</p>
                  <p>D. When a Minnesota florist or nursery sells flowers or other tangible personal property to an out-of-state customer and delivers the items to the customer or a third person within this state, that transaction is taxable. An out-of-state customer is one who is not physically present in Minnesota when placing the order. This item only applies to orders taken directly from the customer by the Minnesota florist or nursery. This item does not apply to telegraphic orders as described in subpart 3.</p>
                  <p>E. When a Minnesota florist or nursery sells flowers or other tangible personal property and delivers the items to someone other than the person who made the purchase, the transaction is taxable even if delivery is to a point outside of Minnesota. The transaction is a sale at retail made in this state and thus is subject to sales tax.</p>

                  <p>The following transactions are not subject to sales or use tax:</p>
                  <p>A. Sales of trees, plants, seeds, or similar items to persons for use in agricultural production of tangible personal property for resale are exempt (upon presentation of proper exemption certificates to the vendors). For example, stock purchased for the purpose of reforestation where forest products will be later harvested in the form of Christmas trees, posts, poles, pulpwood, etc., are exempt. See part 8130.5500.</p>
                  <p>B. Purchases by florists, nurseries, or other like producers or vendors of plants and other tangible personal property which are ultimately sold with the plants, including nonreturnable containers, descriptive labels, stickers, and cards affixed to such containers, peat moss, sand, gravel, crushed rock, shavings, sticks, trellises, and plant ties, to be placed in pots or cans with plants, are exempt as purchases for resale. Purchases of nursery stock, seeds, plants, spray materials, and fertilizers to grow nursery stock for resale are exempt as items to be used or consumed in agricultural production. Purchases of electricity and fuel used or consumed in production are also exempt, except that the portion used for space heating or lighting is taxable. See part 8130.5500.</p>
                  <p>C. When a Minnesota florist or nursery sells flowers or other tangible personal property and delivers the items to the customer outside the state by common carrier, parcel post, United States mail, or the florist's or nursery's own delivery vehicles, the transaction is exempt.</p>

                  <p>The sale, use, or other consumption (hereinafter referred to as a sale) of advertising ordinarily constitutes a sale of a nontaxable service, and hence is not subject to Minnesota sales or use tax. However, if the means of expressing the advertising is through tangible personal property that has a primary functional use independent of its advertising message, the sale of the advertising will be treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property. It shall be presumed that the advertising has a primary functional use independent of its advertising message, and the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that the advertising does not have a primary functional use independent of its advertising message.</p>
                  <p>If a person creates advertising for its own use, all of its purchases of tangible personal property are subject to sales tax. This part, with the exception of subparts 11 and 13, does not apply to such a person. For purposes of subparts 11 and 13, such person shall be treated as an advertiser.</p>

                  <p>The Minnesota sales or use tax does not apply to gross receipts allocable to services which relate to preliminary art, film, or tape. Preliminary art, film, or tape, means art, film, or tape prepared for the purpose of conveying or demonstrating an idea or concept for acceptance by a buyer before the final approval is given by a buyer for finished art or finished film or tape. Examples of preliminary art, film, or tape include roughs, visualizations, comprehensives, layouts, sketches, drawings, paintings, designs, story boards, rough cuts of film and tape, initial audio and visual tracks, and work prints. In the case of print advertising, finished art is the final art used for actual reproduction by photochemical or other process. In the case of broadcast advertising, finished film and tape means the master tape or film and duplicate prints. Gross receipts are treated as allocable to preliminary art only to the extent that they are separately billed or stated.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">8</inline>. <b>Purchases for use in producing both nontaxable advertising and taxable advertising.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>This subpart applies to purchases by an advertising agency of tangible personal property which may used repeatedly, and to tangible personal property which is consumed in part for producing nontaxable advertising and in part for producing taxable advertising.</p>
                  <p>A. If an advertising agency purchases tangible personal property which is used, but not consumed, with respect to both nontaxable advertising and taxable advertising, the determination of whether the purchase is exempt from sales or use tax is based on the initial contract for which the property is purchased. An example of such tangible personal property is a photograph that may be used in connection with both nontaxable advertising services such as a newspaper ad, and taxable advertising such as a mug.</p>
                  <p>If the initial contract with the advertiser is for nontaxable advertising, the purchase by the advertising agency is subject to sales or use tax, notwithstanding that the purchased property may later be used with respect to taxable advertising. The subsequent sale of taxable advertising using such tangible personal property is not exempt from sales and use tax because of the previous tax payment.</p>
                  <p>If the initial contract with the advertiser is for taxable advertising, the item purchased by the advertising agency may be purchased exempt for resale, notwithstanding that the purchased tangible personal property may later be used with respect to nontaxable advertising.</p>
                  <p>If a contract (or contemporaneously negotiated contracts) with an advertiser is for both taxable advertising and nontaxable advertising, the burden is on the advertising agency to demonstrate the portion of the use that is attributable to each of such categories. If this burden is not met, the contract with the advertiser is deemed to be for nontaxable advertising. An example of this rule may be artwork purchased and used initially in making both a magazine ad and in making a calendar. Where the burden of proof is not met by the advertising agency, the purchase is taxable and the subsequent sale of taxable advertising is not exempt because of the previous tax payment.</p>
                  <p>B. If an advertising agency expects to consume materials in producing both nontaxable advertising and taxable advertising, all such materials can be purchased exempt for resale. An example of such material is a ream of paper that may be used in connection with the production of nontaxable advertising such as a brochure, and taxable advertising such as a calendar. To the extent that the materials are subsequently consumed in producing nontaxable advertising, the materials are taxable and must be reported as purchases subject to use tax on the agency's sales and use tax return. The percentage of materials consumed in producing nontaxable advertising is multiplied by the total purchase price of the materials to determine the amount of materials subject to tax. The burden is on the taxpayer to demonstrate the portion of usage that is attributable to taxable advertising. If the burden is not met, all the materials consumed are deemed to be for nontaxable advertising.</p>

                  <p>Advertisers that are tax-exempt entities may appoint advertising agencies as purchasing agents. If a valid purchasing agency appointment is made, the advertiser shall pay no sales or use tax other than what it would have paid had it made the purchase directly. To make a valid appointment of an advertising agency as a purchasing agent, an advertiser must:</p>
                  <p>A. grant to the agent the ability to bind the principal to pay for purchases made by the agent;</p>
                  <p>B. require that the agent not purchase materials in its own name;</p>
                  <p>C. require that all contracts, purchase orders, and other similar writings of the agent shall specifically state that the principal is obligated to pay for materials purchased and that a clear disclosure of the agency relationship is made to the vendor of the materials; and</p>
                  <p>D. require that the advertising agency make no use of the property for itself or for any client other than the principal.</p>
                  <p>When dealing with advertising agencies acting as purchasing agents for tax-exempt entities, vendors must presume that the agency is the purchaser in the absence of an express statement on a purchase order from an advertising agency that the advertising agency is acting as an agent and that the purchase is within the scope of authority expressed in the agreement. The agency may issue exemption certificates as authorized in part 8130.3000 in the name of the principal and signed by the advertising agency as purchasing agent.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">11</inline>. <b>Advertising materials shipped out of state.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.68, subdivision 11, exempts materials designed to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services, which material is shipped out of Minnesota for use solely outside the state. This exemption may apply to the purchase of items in final form or to the purchase of an item that is incorporated into a product that ultimately leaves the state. Similarly, the exemption may apply to the purchase of taxable advertising or to the purchase of tangible personal property that is used in creating or producing nontaxable advertising.</p>
                  <p>This exemption is limited to materials used to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services. This exemption does not include any advertising which is done for other purposes such as public service messages not related to advertising or promoting sales of merchandise or services.</p>
                  <p>When an advertising agency or an advertiser purchases taxable advertising and the advertising agency, the retailer, or the advertiser ships the taxable advertising out of state for use solely outside the state, the advertising agency or advertiser is not subject to sales or use tax with respect to such purchases because it is the purchaser of materials that are designed to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services, and the materials are being shipped outside the state for use solely out of state.</p>
                  <p>When an advertising agency or an advertiser purchases tangible personal property that is used in creating or producing nontaxable advertising, and the advertising agency, the retailer, or the advertiser ships the advertising out of state for use solely outside the state, the advertising agency or advertiser is not subject to sales or use tax with respect to such purchases because it is the purchaser of materials that are designed to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services, and the materials are being shipped outside the state for use solely outside the state. An example of this is when an advertising agency or advertiser purchases advertising brochures that will be shipped out of state. The agency or advertiser can purchase the brochures from the printer exempt from tax. The printer can purchase the paper and ink used to print the brochures exempt because they are being purchased for resale, whether or not the advertising agency or advertiser has an exemption for shipments out of state. The advertising agency or the advertiser is eligible for the exemption described in this subpart whether the item it purchases is in final form, such as a finished brochure or whether the item is incorporated into the product that ultimately leaves the state, such as cardboard that is purchased and becomes part of an advertising sign that is shipped out of state.</p>
                  <p>The rules described in this subpart also apply with respect to an advertising agency if the advertising agency, instead of itself shipping the advertising directly out of state, delivers the advertising to an advertiser within Minnesota for the purpose of subsequently shipping the materials out of state for use solely outside the state. Similarly, the purchase by the advertiser is not subject to sales or use tax with respect to its purchase of the advertising.</p>
                  <p>This exemption does not apply to purchases that are used to create or produce nontaxable advertising to the extent that these purchases do not get sent outside the state. An example of this is when an advertising agency purchases a photograph that it uses in preparing advertising brochures. The sale of the photograph to the advertising agency is taxable. The sale of the brochures to the advertising agency is exempt to the extent that those brochures will be sent out of state as described in this subpart. Another example is when an advertising agency purchases a master tape that it uses to make copies that will be shipped out of state. The copies or the materials used to make them may be purchased exempt but the purchase price of the master tape is taxable unless that tape is also shipped out of state as described in this subpart.</p>

                  <p>When an advertising agency contracts with a recording studio to produce a tape to be used for nontaxable advertising, the recording studio must charge sales tax on all charges to the agency. If the agency hires actors, or directly purchases other exempt services to be used in making the tape, the agency does not pay tax on those purchases. The recording studio only collects tax on the charges it makes to the agency.</p>
                  <p>If a recording studio or printer has contracted directly with the advertiser to produce a tape or printed material, the studio or printer must charge tax on the amount charged to the advertiser, unless the studio or printer is also doing creative work and is acting as an advertising agency. If the studio or printer is acting as an advertising agency, it must pay tax on all its inputs for nontaxable advertising, and does not collect tax on its charges to the advertiser.</p>

                  <p>A sales or use tax is imposed upon the gross receipts from selling, leasing, or granting a license to use tangible personal property. When separately stated, the labor charges for repair, service, and maintenance of tangible personal property is not subject to tax. The producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting of tangible personal property for a consideration for consumers who directly or indirectly furnish the materials used in the producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting is also subject to tax. The transfer of property produced, fabricated, or printed to the special order of the customer is also subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>This part sets forth guidelines for the application of the general statutory provisions to transfers of property and service rendered in the automatic data processing industry.</p>
                  <p>"Automatic data processing services" are those rendered in performing all or part of a series of data processing operations through an interacting assembly of procedures, processes, methods, personnel, and automatic data processing equipment. Automatic data processing services may be provided by manufacturers of data processing equipment, data processing centers, systems designers, consultants, software companies, etc. In addition, there are banks and other businesses which own or lease automatic data processing equipment and use it primarily for their own purposes but occasionally provide services to others. Businesses rendering automatic data processing services will be referred to as "service bureaus."</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">2</inline>. <b>Description of terms.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Data processing terms are described as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. The specific job performance by an automatic data processing installation is called an "application." For example, data processing for a payroll may be called a payroll application.</p>
                  <p>B. The term "automatic data processing equipment" includes computers and their peripheral equipment as well as punched card tabulating machines.</p>
                  <p>C. "Coding" means the list, in computer code, of the successive computer instructions representing successive computer operations for solving a specific problem.</p>
                  <p>D. "Input" means the information or data transferred, or to be transferred, from external storage media (e.g., punched cards, punched paper tape, and magnetic tape) into the internal storage of the computer.</p>
                  <p>E. "Keypunching" means recording information in cards, paper tapes, or magnetic tapes, discs, or drums by punching holes in the cards, paper tapes or inserting magnetic bits on magnetic tape, discs, or drums, to represent letters, digits, and special characters. Keypunching includes the necessary preliminary encoding or marking of the source documents.</p>
                  <p>F. "Keystroke verifying" means the use of a machine known as a punched card verifier or tape transcriber, which has a keyboard, to ensure that information punched in a punch card or transcribed on magnetic tape during the keypunching operation has been punched properly. The machine signals when the punched hole on the card and the depressed key disagree, or when the data on magnetic tape differs from depressed keys.</p>
                  <p>G. "Off-line" is descriptive of a system and the devices in a system in which the operation of equipment is not under the control of a computer.</p>
                  <p>H. "Online" is descriptive of a system and the devices in a system in which the operation of such system or devices is under control of a computer.</p>
                  <p>I. "Output" means the information transferred from the internal storage of the computer to an external storage media (e.g., punched cards, magnetic tape, and tabulated listing).</p>
                  <p>J. "Program" is the complete plan for the solution of a problem, i.e., the complete sequence of automatic data processing equipment instructions necessary to solve a problem. It includes both systems and application programs and subdivisions such as assemblers, compilers, routines, generators, and utility programs.</p>
                  <p>K. A "proof listing" is a tabulated listing of input.</p>
                  <p>L. A "source document" is from which basic data are extracted (e.g., sales invoice).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">3</inline>. <b>Taxable transactions, unless otherwise exempt under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 297A.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Certain transactions are treated as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. Retail sales of new or used data processing equipment are taxable.</p>
                  <p>B. Leases of equipment are subject to tax. A lease includes a contract by which a lessee secures for a consideration the use of equipment which may or may not be on the lessee's premises if the lessee or the lessee's employees operate the equipment, or if the equipment is operated under the direction and control of the lessee or the lessee's employees. Subleasing receipts are taxable without any deduction or credit for tax paid by the original lessee to the lessor, if the original lessee uses the property in addition to subleasing it. Use of equipment on a time-sharing basis, where access to the equipment is only by means of remote access facilities, is not a taxable leasing of such equipment.</p>
                  <p>C. Persons who sell or lease data processing equipment may provide a number of training services with the sale or rental of their equipment. Training services, per se, when separately stated, are not subject to the tax. Training materials, such as books, videos, and cassettes, furnished to the trainees for a specific charge are taxable.</p>
                  <p>D. Generally tax applies to the conversion of customer-furnished data from one physical form of recordation to another.</p>
                  <p>For example, if all or some data in punched cards is duplicated into another set of cards, charges for this service are taxable.</p>
                  <p>E. When additional copies of records, reports, or tabulations are provided, tax applies to the charges made for the additional copies. "Additional copies" are all copies in excess of those produced on multipart carbon paper simultaneous with the production of the original and on the same printer, whether the copies are prepared by rerunning the same program, by using multiple simultaneous printers, by looping a program such that the program is run continuously, by using different programs to produce the same output product, or by other means. Where additional copies are prepared, the tax will be measured by the charge made by the service bureau to the customer. Charges for copies produced by means of photocopying, multilithing, or by other means are also subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>F. Sales of mailing lists in the form of cheshire tapes, gummed labels, and heat transfers produced as a result of a computer run are taxable. However, computer-generated mailing lists alone involving no transferable product are not taxable. Where the service bureau, through the use of its automatic data processing equipment, addresses material to be mailed, with names and addresses furnished by the customer or maintained by the service bureau for the customer, tax does not apply to the charge for addressing. Similarly, where the service bureau prepares labels to be affixed to material to be mailed, with names and addresses furnished by the customer or maintained by the service bureau for the customer, tax does not apply to the charge for producing the labels, when the service bureau itself affixes the labels to the material to be mailed.</p>
                  <p>G. For taxation of retail sales of computer software, see part 8130.9910.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">4</inline>. <b>Nontaxable services.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Certain services are treated as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. "Processing a client's data" means the developing of original information from raw data furnished by the customer. Examples of automatic data processing operations which result in original information are summarizing, computing, extracting, sorting, and sequencing. Such operations also include the updating of a continuous file of information maintained by the customer with the service bureau.</p>
                  <p>Generally, if a person enters into a contract to process a client's data by the use of a computer program, or through an electrical accounting machine programmed by a wired plugboard, the contracts are nontaxable (except if the contract is in the nature of a lease as outlined in subpart 3, item B). Such contracts usually provide that the person will receive the client's source documents, record data in machine-readable form (such as in punch cards or on magnetic tape), make necessary corrections, rearrange or create new information as the result of the processing, and then provide tabulated listings or record output on other media. This service is considered nontaxable even if the total charge is broken down into specific charges for each step. The furnishing of computer programs and data by the client for processing under direction and control of the person providing the service is nontaxable even though charges may be based on computer time. The true object of these contracts is considered to be a service, even though some tangible personal property is incidentally transferred to the client.</p>
                  <p>"Processing a client's data" does not include:</p>
                  <p>(1) work performed under an agreement providing solely for the reformatting of data or for the preparation of a proof listing or the performance of an edit routine or other preprocessing;</p>
                  <p>(2) the using of a computer as a mere printing instrument, as in the preparation of personalized computer-printed letters; or</p>
                  <p>(3) the mere converting of data from one medium to another.</p>
                  <p>B. Designing of systems, converting of systems, consulting, training, and miscellaneous services are services which consist of the developing of ideas, concepts, and designs. Common examples of such services are:</p>
                  <p>(1) designing and implementing computer systems (e.g., determining equipment and personnel required and how they will be utilized);</p>
                  <p>(2) designing storage and data retrieval systems (e.g., determining what data communications and high speed input-output terminals are required);</p>
                  <p>(3) converting manual systems to automatic data processing systems and converting present automatic data processing systems to new systems (e.g., changing a second generation system to a third generation system);</p>
                  <p>(4) consulting services (e.g., a study of all or part of a data processing system);</p>
                  <p>(5) feasibility studies (e.g., studies to determine what benefits would be derived if procedures were automated); and</p>
                  <p>(6) evaluation of bids (e.g., studies to determine which manufacturer's proposal for computer equipment would be most beneficial).</p>
                  <p>C. Persons engaged in providing nontaxable computer services are the consumers of all tangible personal property used in such activities and the tax must be paid on their acquisition of such property.</p>
                  <p>D. Keypunching and keystroke verifying is an item which covers situations where a service bureau's agreement provides only for keypunching, keystroke verifying, and proof listing of data or any combination of these operations. It does not include contracts under which these services are performed as steps in processing a client's data as described in item A.</p>
                  <p>Agreements providing for keypunching and keystroke verification, or keypunching, providing a proof list, and/or verification of data are not regarded as contracts for the fabrication of punch cards and sales of proof lists. Charges therefore are not taxable, whether the cards are furnished by the customer or by the service bureau. Data from source documents may also be recorded directly on magnetic tape (off-line). This operation may include keystroke verifying and/or proof listing of data and is comparable to the punch card operation. Charges for this operation are not taxable whether the magnetic tapes are furnished by the customer or by the service bureau. No tax applies to charges for the imprinting of characters on a document to be used as the input medium in an optical character recognition system. The tax treatment is the same even though paper tape or other medium were used in the operation.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">5</inline>. <b>Microfilming and/or photorecording services.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Microfilming and photorecording services are treated as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. Some electronic data processing systems accept signals directly from the computer (online) at high speeds and then records them on microfilm or on photorecording paper. The computer output medium is merely changed from the more common output media of magnetic tape and tabulated listings to microfilm or photorecording paper. When this end product is the result of a complete computer program as outlined in subpart 4, item B, the tax will not apply.</p>
                  <p>B. In all situations where data is converted by means other than by the use of a complete computer program as outlined in subpart 4, item B, the receipts for microfilming or photorecording are subject to sales tax.</p>
                  <p>An example of this is where data on magnetic tape is converted into combinations of alphanumeric printing, curve plotting, and/or line drawings and put on microfilm or photorecording paper.</p>

                  <p>For purposes of this part, the following words and phrases have the meanings given them in items A to I.</p>
                  <p>A. A "sale" and a "purchase" has the meaning given it in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 3, clause (k).</p>
                  <p>B. "Computer program" has the meaning given it in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 18, clause (3).</p>
                  <p>C. "Custom computer program" has the meaning given it in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 18.</p>
                  <p>D. "Canned or prewritten computer program" is defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 18, to mean a "program that is held or existing for general or repeated sale or lease, even if the prewritten or 'canned' program was initially developed on a custom basis or for in-house use."</p>
                  <p>A computer program is considered to be canned or prewritten if it meets the following guidelines:</p>
                  <p>(1) the object code of the program is not modified by the seller. Modification of the program by inserting file names or formatting data is not changing the object code;</p>
                  <p>(2) the program, copies of which are mass-produced by the manufacturer, is inventoried by a vendor, or otherwise held for repeated sale, license, or lease; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the program is sold, licensed under a written contract agreement, or leased by means of a shrink-wrapped, box-top, or tear-open license agreement or bill of sale.</p>
                  <p>E. "Computer" means an electronic device, including word processing equipment and testing equipment, or combination of components that is programmable and that includes a processor (central processing unit or microprocessor), internal memory, and input and output connections. An electronic device otherwise qualifying as a computer remains a computer even though it may be used for information processing, data acquisition, process control, or for the control of manufacturing machinery or equipment. As provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 18, clause (2), " 'computer' does not include tape-controlled automatic drilling, milling, or other manufacturing machinery or equipment."</p>
                  <p>F. "Maintenance agreement support services" means error corrections received by any means, consultation services, or technical support for computer programs.</p>
                  <p>G. "Upgrades or enhancements" means information and directions which provide new or significantly improved functionality to a computer program. It includes information and directions that dictate the function performed by data processing equipment. Computer software, in any form which is provided under a maintenance agreement, and which does not provide new or significantly improved functionality is deemed to be a maintenance agreement support service.</p>
                  <p>H. "Computer program" means computer software.</p>
                  <p>I. "Storage media" has the meaning given it in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 18, clause (1).</p>

                  <p>A. Sales tax is due on the sale, lease, or license of a canned or prewritten program that is held or existing for general or repeated sale, lease, or license. The sale of canned or prewritten programs is the sale of tangible personal property. Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 11, defines "tangible personal property" in part to include "computer software, whether contained on tape, discs, cards, or other devices."</p>
                  <p>B. Sales tax is not due on the sale, lease, or license of a custom computer program. The sale of a custom computer program is a service transaction. The purpose of the transaction is to obtain personalized service and the expert knowledge of the program creator. The transfer of any tangible personal property is incidental to the service being performed.</p>
                  <p>C. Charges for computer program maintenance furnished for a canned computer program are taxable if the customer is entitled to receive or receives canned computer software upgrades or enhancements. However, charges for computer program maintenance furnished for custom software are not taxable.</p>
                  <p>Maintenance contracts sold in connection with the sale or lease of canned software may provide that the purchaser will be entitled to receive upgrades or enhancements. The maintenance contract may also provide that the purchaser will be entitled to receive maintenance agreement support services.</p>
                  <p>(1) If the maintenance contract is required by the vendor as a condition of the sale or rental of canned software, it will be considered as part of the sale, or rental of the canned software, and the gross sales price is subject to tax whether or not the charge for the maintenance contract is separately stated from the charge for the software.</p>
                  <p>(2) If the maintenance contract is optional to the purchaser of canned software:</p>
                  <p>(a) then only the portion of the contract fee representing upgrades or enhancements delivered on storage media or by any other means is subject to sales tax if the fee for any maintenance agreement support services is separately stated;</p>
                  <p>(b) if the fee for any maintenance agreement support services is not separately stated from the fee for upgrades or enhancements delivered on storage media or by any other means, then 20 percent of the entire charge for the maintenance contract is subject to sales tax;</p>
                  <p>(c) if the maintenance contract only provides canned computer software upgrades or enhancements, and no maintenance agreement support services, then the entire contract is taxable;</p>
                  <p>(d) if the maintenance contract only provides maintenance agreement support services, and the customer is not entitled to or does not receive any canned computer software upgrades or enhancements, then the entire contract is exempt.</p>
                  <p>D. Separately stated charges for written training materials on the use of a canned computer program are taxable. Charges for written training materials on the use of a custom computer program are not taxable, whether or not separately stated. Charges for training services and similarly related services are nontaxable.</p>
                  <p>E. When a computer and canned computer programs are purchased together, the sales tax is due on the total charge.</p>
                  <p>F. When a computer and custom computer programs are purchased together, sales tax is due on the total charge if the charge for the custom computer program is not separately stated.</p>
                  <p>G. Master computer programs which are purchased and used to make copies for sale or lease are property purchased for resale and not subject to sales tax. See Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.01, subdivision 4.</p>
                  <p>H. Examples of services that do not result in custom software include loading parameters to initialize program settings and arranging preprogrammed modules to form a complete program.</p>
                  <p>No tax results when the modifications to existing prewritten software are required to meet the customers' specific needs. These modifications are considered to be custom programming.</p>
                  <p>When the charges for modification are not separately stated, the records of the transaction may be used to demonstrate to what extent the program has been modified.</p>
                  <p>The department will use the following records to determine the extent of modification to prewritten software when there is not a separate charge for the modification: logbooks, timesheets, dated documents, source codes, specifications of work to be done, design of the system, performance requirements, diagrams of programs, flow diagrams, coding sheets, error printouts, translation printouts, correction notes, and invoices or billing notices to the client.</p>
                  <p>If the charges for modification are not separately stated and the records of the transaction do not adequately document the extent of the modifications, the entire charge for the program is taxable.</p>
                  <p>I. Canned or prewritten computer programs may be transferred to the customer in the form of punched cards, data on magnetic tape, or by listing the program instructions on coding sheets. In some cases they are usable as written. However, in most cases it is necessary that the program be modified, adapted, and tested to meet the customer's particular needs. The sale of all property, including coding sheets, cards, or magnetic tape, on which or into which such programs have been coded, punched, or otherwise recorded is subject to tax.</p>
                  <p>J. The temporary transfer of possession of a canned or prewritten computer program, for a consideration, for the purpose of direct use or to be recorded by the customer, is a lease or the granting of a license to use or consume tangible personal property and the tax does apply. Where the consideration consists of license fees or royalty payments for canned or prewritten computer programs, all license fees or royalty payments, present or future, whether for a minimum use or for extended periods, are includable in the measure of tax.</p>
                  <p>K. Programming changes to a canned or prewritten computer program to adapt it to a customer's equipment, including translating a program to a language compatible with a customer's equipment, are in the nature of fabrication labor and are taxable.</p>
                  <p>L. Charges for assembler, compiler, utility, and other canned or prewritten computer programs provided to those who lease or purchase automatic processing equipment are subject to tax.</p>

The commissioner, however, may use the information contained in the claim for refund to adjust the previous assessment as long as the statute of limitations for adjusting that assessment has not expired.</p>

                  <p>In the case of divorced, legally separated, and widowed spouses, either spouse, or the surviving spouse, may apply to the Department of Revenue for a division of their joint income tax liability into two separate liabilities due from each spouse. Application must be made, in writing, by providing a copy of the decree of dissolution of marriage, decree of legal separation, or death record of the deceased spouse, and a copy of the state and federal tax returns, including required attachments and schedules, for the tax year of the liability. The formula for dividing the liability between the spouses is based upon a calculation of what their proportionate shares of the tax would be if they had filed separate returns.</p>
                  <p>Solely for the purpose of apportioning the liability between the spouses, the criteria in items A, B, and C shall be used.</p>
                  <p>A. Income, deductions, credits, exemptions, estimated payments, tax payments, and tax refunds attributable to, earned by, paid by, or paid to, solely one spouse shall be assigned to that spouse.</p>
                  <p>B. All of the items in item A that are attributable to, earned by, or paid to both spouses jointly, or paid from joint funds of both spouses, shall be divided equally between the spouses.</p>
                  <p>C. For purposes of additional assessments of income tax, the separate return apportionment shall be made solely based upon the additional assessment, without regard to any of the items in item A that are reported on the original return.</p>
                  <p>If innocent spouse relief is granted from liability for an additional assessment of income tax, the additional assessment is not included in the calculation of the separate return formula. For example, H and W file a return without remitting the tax. Then, an additional assessment is made, and one of the spouses is granted innocent spouse relief from payment of the assessment. If the spouses are divorced, legally separated, or widowed, their liabilities are their shares of the tax not remitted with the return, and that amount is apportioned as follows:</p>

                  <p>Subject to subpart 3, item C, the separate return formula for calculating the liability of each spouse can be applied both to taxes reported on a return but not paid and to additional assessments of income tax. Innocent spouse relief applies only to additional assessments.</p>
                  <p>In the case of additional assessments, when an innocent spouse claim is allowed, the separate liability calculation is not available; conversely, when a separate liability calculation is allowed, innocent spouse relief is not available.</p>
                  <p>An innocent spouse relief determination or separate liability calculation, or any combination thereof, does not increase or reduce the amount of the underlying tax liability owed jointly by both spouses, whether married, divorced, legally separated, or widowed, that was owing prior to the granting of relief or calculation of the formula.</p>

                  <p>When either spouse applies for a separate liability calculation, the Department of Revenue must mail a copy of its proposed apportionment of liability to the other spouse at his or her last known address. In the case of a widowed spouse, notice must be mailed to the personal representative of the estate of the deceased spouse. The notice to the other spouse shall not be considered a disclosure violation under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 270B. The other spouse then has 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice in which to contest the separate liability calculation shown in the proposal. If the other spouse applies for innocent spouse relief, the department must make the innocent spouse determination first.</p>
                  <p>If either spouse applies for innocent spouse relief, the relief cannot be granted unless the department first gives notice to the other spouse of its intent to grant the relief. The other spouse then has 30 days in which to contest the granting of innocent spouse relief to the applicant spouse. If the other spouse applies for a separate liability calculation, the department must make the innocent spouse determination first.</p>
                  <p>A denial or granting of innocent spouse relief or an apportionment of a liability between spouses, once it becomes final, is not appealable administratively, but is appealable to the Minnesota tax court in the manner provided in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 271.</p>

                  <p>B. "Pertinent return information of a third party" means information regarding the liability or refund of one taxpayer which affects another taxpayer's liability or refund.</p>
                  <p>Examples of such information are:</p>
                  <p>(1) where more than one taxpayer is or may be liable for the same tax types, periods, and amounts, information regarding personal liability under Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.56, including whether a personal liability assessment has been made against a taxpayer; whether the assessment has been appealed administratively or judicially, and the status of the appeal; whether any amounts have been collected from the taxpayer, and whether the taxpayer is still being pursued for collection; and whether a settlement has been made with the taxpayer and for how much, unless the settlement agreement prohibits disclosure;</p>
                  <p>(2) information regarding the sales tax liability of a taxpayer which affects the use tax liability of another taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(3) information used as a basis for a sales tax assessment against a taxpayer that is obtained from other taxpayers, such as statements from the purchasers of a vendor, or the sales tax history of a previous owner of the taxpayer's business;</p>
                  <p>(4) whether amounts claimed by an employer as a withholding tax refund have been claimed as a credit by the employees of the employer on their individual income tax returns;</p>
                  <p>(5) when taxpayers are married and filing separate individual income tax returns, whether either spouse itemized deductions, and if so, how much of the state income tax deduction had to be included in the Minnesota taxable income of either spouse;</p>
                  <p>(6) whether two or more taxpayers are claiming the same dependent on their individual income tax returns;</p>
                  <p>(7) information regarding items of expense, deduction, credit, or loss on the individual income tax return of a taxpayer which affects the amount of income that should be reported on the individual income tax return of another taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(8) information from the corporate franchise tax return or tax records of a corporation needed to determine the correctness of a corporate franchise tax return of a unitary group with which the corporation is no longer affiliated;</p>
                  <p>(9) whether a taxpayer filing a property tax refund return has been claimed as a dependent on the individual income tax return of another taxpayer;</p>
                  <p>(10) information from the individual income tax returns of taxpayers who live in the home of a taxpayer filing a property tax refund return that is needed to determine household income;</p>
                  <p>(11) when a taxpayer's business accounts receivable have been acquired by a financial institution or other third party pursuant to an assignment, sale, security agreement, or liquidation, information from the sales tax returns of the taxpayer necessary for the financial institution or third party to determine the sales taxes it must collect and remit as it collects the accounts receivable;</p>
                  <p>(12) whether alimony claimed as a deduction on the individual income tax return of one ex-spouse has been reported as income on the individual income tax return of the other ex-spouse; and</p>
                  <p>(13) information regarding the allocation of the purchase price of a business among the various kinds of assets sold, when the method of allocation reported on the individual income tax return of the seller is different from the allocation reported on the individual income tax return of the purchaser.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subpart <inline name="num">1</inline>. <b>Definition of pattern of repeated failures.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. Taxpayers who have demonstrated a pattern of repeated failures to pay taxes by the due date are subject to a penalty under Minnesota Statutes, sections 60A.15, subdivision 9e; 60A.199, subdivision 6a; 289A.60, subdivision 5a; 297.43, subdivision 4a; 297C.14, subdivision 9; 299F.23, subdivision 5; and 349.217, subdivision 5a. For purposes of imposing this penalty, a "pattern of repeated failures" means that during the previous 25 months the taxpayer has not paid tax by the due date for the same tax type on at least three occasions. If one or more of the occasions is a failure to pay as defined in item D, subitem (1), then the pattern must be at least four occasions.</p>
                  <p>B. If there are separate taxes imposed under the same chapter of Minnesota Statutes or separate taxes that are required to be reported on one return and paid at the same time, "same tax type" means all taxes imposed under that chapter, or all taxes, fees, or other payments required to be reported on that return and paid at the same time.</p>
                  <p>C. For purposes of withholding tax, "failure to pay" means failure to make all deposits due during the quarterly reporting period by the due date of the quarterly return.</p>
                  <p>D. Failure to pay includes:</p>
                  <p>(1) failure to make an estimated payment by the due date that results in the imposition of an additional charge for underpayment of estimated tax; or</p>
                  <p>(2) failure to make a June estimated payment or electronic funds transfer payment by the due date that results in imposition of a late payment penalty.</p>
                  <p>E. Instances of making a late payment, where the late payment penalty has been abated because the taxpayer established reasonable cause for the lateness, are not included in the definition of pattern of repeated failures under this subpart.</p>
                  <p>F. For purposes of measuring the 25-month period, if the time in which to pay tax has been extended and the tax is not paid within the extended time period, the late payment violation is considered to have occurred on the original due date of the tax.</p>

                  <p>If a taxpayer meets the criteria under subpart 1, a penalty for repeated failures to pay taxes cannot be imposed unless the commissioner gives the taxpayer written notice. The notice must be sent to the taxpayer's last known address ten days before the next tax payment after the notice is due. The ten days commence on the day following the date of the notice. The notice must contain a description of the previous late payment violations, including the tax type and tax period, and a warning that the penalty will be imposed upon future violations. The notice remains in effect for any late payment violations for the same tax type or types occurring after the date of the notice. If a length of time passes after the notice so that there are two or less violations in the preceding 25-month period, including violations upon which a penalty for repeated failures to pay taxes has been imposed, the notice expires. If penalties are subsequently imposed under subpart 3, the correctness of the notice may be appealed as indicated in subpart 4.</p>

                  <p>After a taxpayer establishes a pattern of delinquencies that meets the criteria under subpart 1, and the notice required by subpart 2 has been given, the penalty for future late payment violations is 25 percent of the amount of tax, as finally determined by the commissioner to be owing, that is not paid by the due date. The penalty is in addition to other applicable penalties or charges imposed by law.</p>

                  <p>If a 25 percent penalty is imposed, the taxpayer may file a request for an abatement of the penalty on the ground that there is reasonable cause for the late payment upon which the penalty is imposed. Also, in the same time and manner as making a request for an abatement, the taxpayer may appeal the imposition of the penalty on the ground that the notice under subpart 2 is incorrect. The right to contest the notice does not include claiming that there was reasonable cause for the lateness of a late payment violation listed in the notice, if the time in which to request an abatement of the late payment penalty for that violation has expired. The procedure under this subpart is governed by Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.34.</p>
