      <h2 class="headnote">Delivery requirements. </h2>
      <p>Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.61">297A.61</a>, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (1), provides that a transfer of title constitutes a sale. Title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any condition explicitly agreed upon by the parties. However, no title to goods can pass under a contract for sale prior to identifying such goods as the exact goods to be delivered under the contract. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods. Although the seller retains the legal title to the goods, title passes if the purchaser has the right to the use, possession, and enjoyment of such goods. The following rules apply.</p>

        <h3 class="item_no">A.</h3>
        <p> When the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer, but does not require the seller to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at time and place of shipment.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="rule.8130.0200.1.B" class="item">

        <p> When the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes upon tender there.</p>

        <h3 class="item_no">C.</h3>
        <p> Unless otherwise agreed, when the term is "f.o.b." (free on board) the place of shipment, title passes when the seller places the goods in the possession of the designated carrier, or if there is no designated carrier, the seller places the goods in the possession of a common carrier after making a contract for their transportation that is reasonable in view of the circumstances and the nature of the goods.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Revesting after rejection or revocation. </h2>
      <p>A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance, revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a sale. For example, where a customer holds a television set for a few days and thereafter returns it to the retailer, the retailer is not required to report the transaction, as there was no sale.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Mixed transaction. </h2>
      <p>A transaction involving performance of a nontaxable repair service, and incident thereto, a transfer of tangible personal property to the purchaser is not considered a sale for sales and use tax purposes if:</p>
      <div id="rule.8130.0200.4.A" class="item">
        <a title="Link to item A" class="permalink" href="#rule.8130.0200.4.A">§</a>

        <a title="Link to item B" class="permalink" href="#rule.8130.0200.4.B">§</a>
        <h3 class="item_no">B.</h3>
        <p> no separate charge is made for such property. In such cases, the service provider is regarded as rendering a nontaxable service. However, if a separate charge is made for the property transferred, a sale within the meaning of the Sales and Use Tax Law is deemed to have occurred.</p>
        <p>Example. A jeweler uses a spring costing 25 cents to repair a watch. The jeweler bills the customer $6 for repair services. Since the cost of the spring is insignificant in relation to the charge for repair services, no sale of the spring is considered to have been made. The jeweler is required to pay a use tax on the spring if the jeweler did not pay a sales tax at the time of purchase. However, if the jeweler bills separately for the spring, the jeweler must collect a sales tax from the customer.</p>

      <p>Any item which is taxable if sold is also taxable if leased. If an item is contracted for lease in Minnesota and physical possession of the item by the lessee occurs in Minnesota, a taxable transaction has occurred even if the lessee removes the property from the state for personal use. However, leased property shipped or transported outside Minnesota by the lessee, which will be used in a trade or business outside Minnesota by the lessee without any intermediate use in Minnesota, and which will not be returned to Minnesota except in the course of interstate commerce, is exempt from tax if the lease is not subject to tax in the jurisdiction to which the leased property is transported for use or is used in the other jurisdiction as part of a maintenance contract.</p>
      <p>All payments made pursuant to leases of tangible personal property, including mobile equipment such as motor vehicles, trailers, and contractor's equipment, constitute sales made in Minnesota if such property is either garaged or principally used, including use thereof in interstate commerce for delivery or other temporary purpose outstate, by the lessee at or from a Minnesota situs of the lessee.</p>
      <p>Example 1. Motor Freight Line, a Minnesota company, leases ten tractor-trailers from a leasing company. The contract is signed at the Minnesota office of Motor Freight Line, and all payments under the lease are made from this office. Motor Freight Line uses seven of the tractor-trailers to haul freight in interstate commerce to and from its Minnesota freight depot. The remaining three tractor-trailers are used to haul freight in interstate commerce to and from Motor Freight Line's depot in Illinois. From time to time, the three tractor-trailers enter Minnesota in the course of the normal interstate commerce activities of Motor Freight Line. The lease price attributable to the seven tractor-trailers used to haul freight to and from the Minnesota freight depot constitutes a Minnesota sale. The lease price of the remaining three tractor-trailers does not constitute a Minnesota sale.</p>
      <p>Example 2. Amalgamated Contractors, a Minnesota company, leases a heavy-duty crane for a construction job in Iowa on a monthly basis. The payments are made by Amalgamated to the lessor in Iowa. Subsequently, Amalgamated secures a construction contract in Minnesota and transfers the crane to the Minnesota site. Lease payments due while the crane is located in Minnesota are subject to Minnesota use tax although such payments continue to be made in Iowa.</p>
      <p>Example 3. Peter Smith, a resident of Fargo, North Dakota, leases a chain saw from XYZ Rental-All, an equipment leasing firm, with an office only in Moorhead, Minnesota. Mr. Smith intends to use the saw at the residence in Fargo, and takes possession of the saw from the rental firm in Minnesota. A Minnesota sales tax is due and payable on this transaction.</p>

      <p>All lease payments made pursuant to leases executed in Minnesota for drive-it-yourself automobiles, trailers, or other vehicles on a mileage, hourly, or other time basis are taxable, irrespective of whether such vehicles are to be used exclusively in Minnesota or are to be used in other states. Thus, where the lessee delivers the vehicle to the lessor in a state other than Minnesota, either by express agreement with the lessor or without securing prior consent, a lease payment made to the lessor in such other state constitutes consideration for a Minnesota sale.</p>
      <p>All lease payments made in Minnesota pursuant to leases executed in states other than Minnesota for drive-it-yourself automobiles, trailers, or other vehicles on a mileage, hourly, or other time basis do not constitute consideration paid for a Minnesota sale. Consequently, such payments are not subject to the Minnesota sales and use tax.</p>
      <p>Example 1. A rental agency, located in Minnesota, leases an automobile to X. Thereafter, X drives the automobile to California and returns the vehicle to the rental agency's office in Los Angeles, and there pays the total lease charge of $280. The lease charge constitutes a sale in Minnesota, and the rental agency is required to include the entire $280 in its gross receipts subject to tax.</p>
      <p>Example 2. A rental agency, located in New York, leases an automobile to Y. Thereafter, Y drives the automobile to Minnesota and returns the automobile to the rental agency's office in this state, and there pays the total lease charge of $150. No part of the $150 payment is subject to the Minnesota sales or use tax.</p>

        <p> Certain types of equipment are only available with the services of an operator. For example, the hiring of a taxicab involves the concurrent hiring of a taxicab driver. The same is true with respect to bus companies and commercial airlines. The primary or chief activity of the taxicab company, or the bus line, or the airline, is furnishing transportation services. For all practical purposes, one cannot hire a taxicab or a bus or a commercial airline without accepting the services of a licensed operator.

        <p>When a driver or operator is furnished along with the equipment, the lessor, by the lessor's employee or agent, retains control of the equipment.

      <p>Items deductible from the lease price are gasoline, maintenance labor, public liability insurance, license fees, and highway use taxes. If these items are separately stated by description in the lease agreement and by specific amounts in either the lease agreement, billing, or invoice, they may be deducted in determining the amount of the lease payment subject to tax.

      <p>When a privilege to possess, use, and enjoy tangible personal property is granted by the owner for a determinate time and on a fixed rental fee basis, or on some other basis that includes a fixed rental fee, and the owner surrenders possession and control under the terms of the agreement to the other party, such arrangement represents a lease. However, where the arrangement contemplates that the owner, for a consideration, will permit the other party to use the property, without the owner divesting physical possession thereof, the arrangement is a "license to use" and is a sale under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.61">297A.61</a>, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2).</p>
      <p>Example. A lumber dealer sells lumber of only standard dimensions because the majority of customers are building contractors and generally only require lumber in standard sizes. Whenever large lumber orders of nonstandard dimensions are received, the dealer will either cut the lumber and make an additional charge, or allow the contractor to use the sawing equipment on the dealer's premises for $15 per hour. The charges made by the dealer, for the use of sawing equipment by the contractor, represent the granting of "a license to use" and are taxable.</p>

      <p>As used in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.61">297A.61</a>, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), "consideration in money" refers to the amount of money whether in the form of currency, coins, negotiable instruments, or scrip which the parties agree shall be paid by the purchaser.</p>
      <p>Example 1. "M," manufacturer, purchases a machine for use in production. "M" pays $5,000 in cash and gives a $20,000, 90-day promissory note drawn to the order of "V," vendor. The note bears interest at six percent. The consideration in money is $25,000. The $20,000 note is still deemed to be "consideration in money" even though "V," holds it until maturity, as "V" may convert the note, plus accrued interest, into cash by negotiation. The accrued interest that may be paid to "V," either at the time of negotiation or at the time of maturity, does not constitute "consideration in money" for sales tax purposes in respect of the sale of the machine.</p>
      <p>Example 2. Same facts as in example 1, except that "V" discounts the $20,000 promissory note at a bank for $19,500. The consideration paid by "M" is $25,000.</p>
      <p>Transactions described in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.61">297A.61</a>, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), are sales or purchases where effected by exchange or barter.

        <p> Example 1. A customer enters into an agreement with an upholsterer whereby the latter will remove old fabric from the customer's living room sofa and replace it with fabric chosen by the customer. The cost agreed upon is $300. Service charges are $150, with the remaining $150 representing the cost of the materials. As the reupholstering repair permits the customer to continue to use the sofa for the purpose for which it was acquired, only the $150 for material represents a sale, provided the charges for materials are billed separately, and that such charges represent a reasonable sales price for such material were it purchased without the service charge for reupholstering. If the customer had furnished the material, no sale would have resulted.</p>

As the granting of the privilege of admission is at a place in Minnesota, the sale of the tickets to A constitutes a sale.</p>

      <p>The following criteria apply in determining whether a license to use real property for lodging purposes constitutes a sale under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.61">297A.61</a>, subdivision 3, paragraph (g), clause (2):</p>

        <p> A person engaged in the furnishing of taxable lodging facilities, in determining the amount of consideration received subject to the tax, shall include separately stated charges for telecommunication service and amounts received for the use of a television set or other items of tangible personal property.</p>
        <p>Example 1. "G," guest, registers at hotel without entering into an enforceable written agreement whereby G will occupy a room for a period in excess of 30 days. G stays at the hotel for five full weeks. Thereafter, G settles the account and vacates the room. Although occupancy was in excess of the statutory period of 30 days, the transaction constitutes a sale in accordance with item B.</p>
        <p>Example 2. Hotel, in addition to furnishing sleeping accommodations and related service to transients, leases rooms or suites to ten persons on a monthly basis. "G," guest, occupies a small suite, and pays in advance on the first day of each month. The leasing of a suite to G does not constitute a sale, as a hotel also may be a lodging house, and G, who is a tenant at will, is required to give notice of termination of at least 30 days.</p>
        <p>Example 3. "T," tenant, rents an apartment from Landlord without a lease. T pays rent weekly. Each of the parties is required to give notice of one week of intention to terminate. Consequently, this arrangement constitutes a sale, as the leasing of the premises to T is for a period of less than 30 days.</p>
        <p>Example 4. Motel charges guest $50 per day for a room. "G," guest, makes three local telephone calls. Motel bills G for $50 plus a separately stated charge of $1.50 for telephone calls, and $5 for use of video games. The taxable consideration paid by G is $56.50 represented by the $50 charge for the room, $5 charge for the video games, and $1.50 for telephone calls.</p>
        <p>Example 5. If "X" company leases a room in a hotel or motel on a yearly basis for occasional use by employees or guests, the charge is exempt even if a particular room is not reserved for the exclusive use of X company.</p>

When a user heats the same area with two sources of heat, each using different fuels, such as a home heated by wood which also has an electric heating system, then the primary source of residential heat is the source which supplies more heat than any other source for the largest period of time during the heating season.

        <p> The rate a utility cooperative charges its patrons includes a capital contribution in addition to the cost of providing services. The bylaws of the cooperative require that the excess of its revenue over its operating costs and other expenses are capital contributions paid by its patrons.

        <p> A "general contractor" is a person who contracts to furnish the necessary materials and labor for the performance of a construction contract, and generally is one who contracts to build the entire project or a major portion thereof, or who contracts to install special building equipment, or who repairs or remodels a limited area in a structure at a price that includes machinery, equipment, and installation charges. The person for whom the general contractor performs the work is generally the owner.</p>

        <p> A "subcontractor" is a person who contracts to furnish the necessary materials and labor for the completion of a portion of the general construction contract at the job site. The subcontractor ordinarily contracts with the general contractor to perform a certain part of the work which the general contractor has undertaken to perform under the general construction contract.</p>

        <p> The term "construction contract" as used herein refers to a contract under the terms of which a contractor agrees to perform construction activities resulting in an alteration, repair, or improvement of real property. Where machinery or equipment is attached to real property in such a manner and with the intent that it becomes a nontemporary accession to the real property, the contract pursuant to which it is attached shall be regarded as a "construction contract." Any attachment of property by or for a lessor thereof to realty not owned by the lessor where the lessor retains title and ownership of the property shall be considered a temporary accession to the real property and such property therefore retains its character as tangible personal property.</p>
        <p>The term "construction contract" shall not include any contract for a sale of machinery or equipment which the seller, pursuant to the contract, will attach to or install upon real property if:</p>

        <p> Such construction activities do not include the sale and installation of an appliance, machinery, equipment, or other item of tangible personal property in such a manner as not to become a permanent part of the real estate. Computers shall be considered to retain their classification and identification as personal property when installed because of such factors as industry standards, custom and practice, usage, and uniqueness. Where a fixed price or lump sum construction contract provides for the incidental transfer of certain tangible personal property and the contractor sells such items only as a part of the construction project, the contractor is not regarded as a retailer provided that such personal property comprises an insubstantial portion of the total contract price.</p>
        <p>Example 1. A dealer agrees to replace the old refrigerators with new models in a four-unit dwelling. The sale and installation of the refrigerators does not constitute a construction contract. The transaction represents a sale at retail to the owner of the four-unit dwelling.</p>
        <p>Example 2. A computer manufacturer sells and leases computers and also installs them on the customer's property. The sale or lease of a computer, regardless of size, is a sale or lease of tangible personal property and the installation does not constitute a construction contract.</p>
        <p>Example 3. A leasing company purchases a piece of equipment from company A and leases it to company B. Company A installs the equipment on the property of company B. The sale and installation of the equipment does not constitute a construction contract, since the owner of the equipment is not the same as the owner of the property to which the equipment was installed. The equipment is considered to be tangible personal property and the leasing company purchases the property exempt for resale and collects the sales tax on the lease payments from company B.</p>

        <p> The exemption from the tax on the sale of tangible personal property to the United States, as well as to corporations and other institutions exempt under Minnesota Statutes, sections <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.67">297A.67</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.71">297A.71</a>, does not extend to building materials, supplies, and equipment purchased by a contractor under an agreement to erect a building or to alter, repair, or improve real estate for such exempt entity unless the sale is specifically exempted under section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.71">297A.71</a>. However, purchases of such building materials, supplies, and equipment by exempt entities are exempt from the sales and use tax.</p>
        <p>Example. A school district enters into a contract with a contractor for school construction. The contractor purchases materials for this job from various suppliers. The construction is clearly an alteration or improvement to real property with material purchased by the contractor for use in constructing the school. These transactions constitute retail sales and are subject to the sales tax. Had the school district purchased the materials directly, the purchase of the materials by the school district would have been exempt.</p>

        <p> If an exempt entity has entered into a fixed price construction contract which covers the complete structure including the materials, and the exempt entity furnishes some or all of the materials to the contractor for a credit against the contract price, a taxable sale occurs when the exempt entity transfers the materials to the contractor.</p>
        <p>Example. A school district enters into a contract with a contractor for the construction of a school building. The contractor not only specified the price at which the contractor agreed to deliver the completed school, but made known to the school district the portion of the total cost of construction allocated to building materials and supplies. In addition, the contractor furnished the school district with the names of the several suppliers and the descriptions and price of each item or items furnished by each of such suppliers. Thereafter, the school district purchased the specified items at the price furnished by the contractor and made payments from its own funds to the suppliers. The material and supplies so purchased were thereafter delivered to the contractor and, in return, the school district received credit against the contract price for the payments made by it.</p>
        <p>Although the initial purchase of the material and supplies by the school district is exempt, the transfer to the contractor is a transfer of title or possession and taxable as such for the following reason: the contractor has agreed to deliver a completed structure which necessarily includes the materials; during construction of the building the materials will be in the possession of the contractor, who bears the risk of any loss of such materials during construction; and a portion of the contract price is correspondingly reduced by the cost of the materials paid to the supplier by the school district.</p>

        <p>Example 2. A contractor-retailer purchased ten bathtubs at $150 each and 20 bathroom sinks at $40 each. Being primarily a retailer, the contractor-retailer paid no tax at time of purchase, but gave the supplier an exemption certificate. Thereafter, in March, the contractor-retailer sold at retail two bathtubs at $200 each and five bathroom sinks at $55 each. In addition, the contractor-retailer utilized three bathtubs and six bathroom sinks in contracting activities. The contractor-retailer makes the following calculation for the sales and use tax reported for the month of March (for purposes of this example, it is assumed that in March no other sales were made at retail and no other material, etc., were used in contracting activities):</p>

    <h1 class="headnote">8130.1500 EXEMPTION FOR PROPERTY TAKEN IN TRADE.</h1>
    <p>Any amount allowed as a credit against the sales price for tangible personal property taken in trade for resale is exempt under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.67">297A.67</a>, subdivision 26. The payoff of the old contract does not affect the amount allowed on the trade-in; even if this indebtedness is included in the new contract. The property so accepted qualifies for the exemption if the property is taxable under the Sales and Use Tax Law or the Sales Tax on Motor Vehicles Law.</p>
    <p>Example 1. A dealer sells a new boat with a list price of $3,000 to a customer. The dealer accepts the customer's used boat in trade and gives the customer a credit of $1,000. The credit qualifies for the exemption. Consequently, the sales price is $2,000.</p>
    <p>Example 2. A mobile home dealer sells a customer a new mobile home with a list price of $12,000. The customer trades in an old mobile home which has an existing loan of $2,000 on it. The dealer agrees to include the payoff amount of the old contract in the new contract. The dealer allows $5,000 for the trade-in of the customer's mobile home. The following represents the amount of financing the customer arranges for and the sales price is $7,000:</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Refunds for property adjustments. </h2>
      <p>Where taxable property is returned, the retailer's reported gross receipts may be reduced in the month the property is returned by the amount of the sales price refunded, provided that the applicable sales tax has also been refunded. If the credit given or the cash refunded for the returned merchandise is reduced by a handling charge, the entire amount of sales tax collected should be refunded and a reduction of gross sales for the full sales price should be taken on the sales and use tax return. Where a purchaser of taxable property makes a gift of such property, and subsequently the recipient of the gift returns the property to the vendor and requests a refund of the amount paid for the property, the recipient is entitled to a refund of the sales tax applicable to the amount of the sales price that is refunded. Repossession of tangible personal property does not constitute a return of property. Merchandise that was sold on approval and later returned may be deducted from gross receipts.</p>
      <p>Adjustments to the sales price because of unknown damage at the time of sale, i.e. scratches, dents, etc., but not detected until a later time, may be deducted from gross receipts.</p>
      <p>Example 1. A hardware dealer sells a customer a lawnmower for $100. The customer pays $100 plus sales tax. As the lawnmower was defective, it was returned to the hardware dealer, and the total price including sales tax paid was refunded to the customer. Gross receipts will be reduced by $100.</p>
      <p>Example 2. Retail Tires sells four new tires to a customer at $40 each under guarantee in June. In August, the customer returns one tire and is given a cash refund of $30 plus tax. Retail Tires may reduce gross sales by the $30 refunded on the August sales and use tax return.</p>
      <p>Example 3. A purchases taxable personal property from a retailer at a price of $100 plus sales tax. A then makes a gift of the property to B. B returns the property to the retailer and requests a refund of the amount paid for the property. B (the donee of the gift) is entitled to a refund of the $100 sales price plus sales tax. The retailer may reduce gross sales by $100 on the sales tax return for merchandise returned and thereby receive credit for the amount of refundment.</p>
      <p>Example 4. A lumber company sells 20 redwood posts to a customer for $100 plus sales tax. The customer decides not to use the posts and returns them to the lumber company. The lumber company has a policy of refunding all but $10 on all returned merchandise. This $10 represents a handling fee for placing the merchandise back into stock. The lumber company is required to refund the customer the entire sales tax and claim a reduction of $100 in gross sales on its sales and use tax return.</p>

      <p>If a person elects to file a consolidated return, a list containing the business name and address of each separate place of business must be submitted to the commissioner when applying for a permit. An application containing such a list constitutes an application for each listed business name and address.

Whether the property has been purchased for use in Minnesota usually will be determinable at or near the time of its purchase. Thus, a nonresident purchaser who can show that property had been purchased and previously used in another state for a reasonable period of time before being brought into Minnesota for use therein, usually will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.665">297A.665</a>, paragraph (c).</p>

      <p>Under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.80">297A.80</a>, a credit is allowed against the use tax due under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.63">297A.63</a>, from any person on any item purchased by the person if the item has previously been subjected to a sales or use tax in another state or a subdivision of the other state. The credit is allowed to the extent of the rate legally imposed on the item in the other state. If the tax paid in the other state is subject to refund by the other state, it is not legally imposed for purposes of this credit. If the rate imposed by the other state or any subdivision of the other state is equal to or higher than the rate imposed under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.63">297A.63</a>, then no tax is due. The credit is not allowed for taxes paid to a foreign country.</p>
      <p>Calculation of use tax due is governed by Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.80">297A.80</a>. That section states that use tax provisions apply only at the rate measured by the difference between the rate fixed by Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.63">297A.63</a>, and the rate by which the previous tax was calculated in the other state. The maximum amount of tax which will be assessed by Minnesota according to Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.80">297A.80</a>, is the amount of tax calculated from the Minnesota rate. Use tax due to Minnesota is the tax prescribed by the rate in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.63">297A.63</a>, less the rate paid in the state of purchase. If the sales tax imposed in the state of purchase is equal to or greater than the amount of Minnesota use tax, no Minnesota use tax is due.</p>

          <p> A restaurant, with a convenience food area near the cash register, sells a package of cinnamon rolls, labeled at 12 servings, for $5.98, an apple for 75 cents, and a single-serving container of milk for 49 cents. There is a napkin dispenser and a drinking straw dispenser on a counter nearby. The restaurant is owned by a seller whose establishments in this state have a combined prepared food sales percentage of 85 percent, meaning that for most of the restaurant's sales of food, the seller only has to make utensils available to the customer. Since the package of cinnamon rolls has four or more servings and it is sold for a single price, the seller is not providing a utensil in its sale of the cinnamon rolls simply because a utensil is available for the customer, and therefore the cinnamon rolls are not prepared food. The utensils are provided by the seller for the apple and the single-serving container of milk, since the utensils are available.</p>

          <p> A bakery, owned by a seller whose establishments in this state combined have a sales percentage of 80 percent, sells fruit pies it baked at $2 a slice. Each slice equals one serving. Five slices are packaged and sold for $9.40. The sales receipt simply provides that the price of the apple pie is $9.40. This package is sold for a single price.

This package is not sold for a single price, since the seller charged $2 for each slice in the package, as shown by the sales receipt. Therefore, if the seller has utensils available to the customer, the utensils are considered to be provided by the seller, meaning that the pie slices are considered prepared food and are subject to tax.

The business has a prepared food sales percentage greater than 75 percent, so that it only need have utensils available for any food sold at the establishment for the utensils to be considered "provided by the seller." However, the fact that no utensils are provided by the seller does not mean that the pizza is not prepared food. Rather, it is prepared food because it is heated by the seller and also because the seller combines food ingredients and sells it as a single item.</p>

It instructs the distributor to deliver 70,000 gallons to a storage tank used to supply such petroleum products to licensed motor vehicles owned and operated by it. The remaining 30,000 gallons are delivered to a storage tank used to supply fuel oil for heating trucking company's premises. For the month of October, trucking company reports and pays the special fuel (as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/296A.01">296A.01</a>, subdivision 46) excise tax on 70,000 gallons.

      <p>Materials that are used or consumed in providing a service other than production, fabrication, printing, or processing of tangible personal property for retail sale are taxable.</p>
      <p>Generally, the production process begins with the removal of raw materials from stock for the purpose of commencing activities effecting changes thereon in the course of producing the intended product. The production process ends when the completed state is achieved. The completed state includes the packaging of the individual product, but not palletizing or otherwise preparing the packaged product for shipment. If the product is not packaged, the process ends when it is placed into finished goods inventory. If the package is not placed into finished goods inventory prior to shipment, the process ends when the last process prior to loading for shipment has been completed.</p>
      <p>Quality control, testing, design, and research and development activities are part of the production process. The production process does not include the storage and preservation of raw materials prior to commencement of the production process; the handling, movement, storage, and preservation of completed goods; or the painting, cleaning, repairing, and maintenance of equipment and facilities. Agricultural and industrial production does not include the preparation, cooking, mixing, or furnishing of meals. "Meals" means food which will ordinarily be consumed without delay and without further preparation or storage.</p>
      <p>In the case of mining or quarrying, the production process begins with the removal of overburden from the site of the ore, mineral, peat deposit, or surface materials and ends when the last process before stockpiling is performed. If the product is not stockpiled before shipment, the production process ends when the last process before loading for shipment has been completed.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Exempt materials. </h2>
      <p>Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.25">297A.25</a>, subdivision 9, provides exemption for all materials used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production of personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail, whether or not the item so used becomes an ingredient or constituent part of the property produced. All materials that are ingredients or component parts of the product, and materials that act on or come in contact with the product but that are not machinery, equipment, implements, tools, accessories, appliances, contrivances, furniture, or fixtures, are within this exemption. Examples of such exempt materials are grinding compounds, polishing compounds, and lithographic printing plates. The phrase "used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production" also includes materials that are only used once in production and even though they have not been physically consumed will not be used again. Examples of such exempt materials that could qualify for this exemption are keylines, typeset used for printing, and paper pan and cake liners used for baking goods.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Chemicals and fertilizers. </h2>
      <p>The purchase or use of chemicals or fertilizers for use or consumption in agricultural or industrial production is not taxable.</p>
      <p>The purchase of chemicals and fertilizers for application to agricultural crops to achieve soil fertilization, weed control, or elimination of crop disease, or to prevent or destroy pest infestation of growing crops is not taxable. The agricultural crops must be grown for sale or as feed for use or consumption in agricultural production.</p>
      <p>The purchase of chemicals for the control or eradication of pests is exempt if used for the health and protection of those animals whose feed is exempt under subpart 11. For purposes of this subpart, "pest" means an insect, rodent, nematode, fungus, weed, terrestrial or aquatic plant, animal life, virus, bacteria, or other organism. Pest control chemicals include insecticides (fly sprays, fly tapes, louse killers), pesticides, and rodenticides (mouse, rat, and gopher poison).</p>
      <p>Chemicals and fertilizers that are purchased for nonproduction use such as lawn fertilizers, weed control chemicals used in a lawn or garden, or insect spray for home use, are all taxable.</p>
      <p>Herbicides and fertilizers that are purchased by farmers for use on land that is part of the Conservation Reserve Program or other specifically enumerated government program are exempted under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.25">297A.25</a>, subdivision 9.</p>
      <p>Detergents or other cleaning chemicals used in cleaning factory or farm buildings, including buildings used to house animals, are taxable. However, disinfectants that are not merely detergent additives and that are applied to agricultural animals, or used to disinfect their surroundings to control or eradicate animal disease or pests, are not taxable.</p>
      <p>Chemicals used for cleaning food processing machinery and equipment are also exempt. However, the chemicals used to clean the area surrounding the food processing machinery and equipment are taxable.</p>
      <p>Chemicals that are used to clean tooling or equipment that is used in production are taxable because the chemicals are not used or consumed in the production process.</p>
      <p>However, if applying the chemical to the tooling or equipment, other than for ordinary cleaning and maintenance, is required to manufacture the particular product, the purchase of that chemical is exempt.</p>

      <p>The purchase of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, and water that is used or consumed directly in agricultural or industrial production is not taxable. If these items are used for space heating or lighting, however, they are taxable.</p>
      <p>The purchase of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, or water to power a machine or fixture that controls the lighting or climate of a building is taxable, unless the lighting or climate control is a special requirement necessary to produce that particular agricultural or industrial product. If the lighting or climate control is a special requirement, then the amount of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, or water used for that lighting or climate control is not taxable. The amount used must be determined by deducting the amount of fuel, electricity, gas, steam, or water used to maintain average lighting or climate control from the total amount used for lighting or climate control. "Average climate control" means a summer temperature range of 73 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit and a winter temperature range of 68 to 74.5 degrees Fahrenheit. "Average lighting" means the amount of wattage per square foot necessary to adequately light the area if lighting is not a special requirement necessary to produce a particular agricultural or industrial product.</p>
      <p>There is a separate statutory exemption for electricity used to make snow for certain ski areas. See Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.25">297A.25</a>, subdivision 9.</p>

      <p>Sales of materials to persons engaged in agricultural or industrial production for use in packaging, shipping, or delivering tangible personal property produced or manufactured by them are exempt. Packaging material includes nonreturnable containers, but does not include returnable containers except as otherwise specified in this subpart.</p>
      <p>Packaging materials do not include reusable containers, reusable pallets, or other reusable materials that are used to ship tangible personal property between production facilities, or for handling, storing, or moving materials within the confines of business premises.</p>
      <p>"Container" means the articles in which tangible personal property is placed for shipment and delivery, such as cartons, cans, and bags. Container does not include items that are used primarily to facilitate loading, unloading, handling, transportation, or storage of products, such as bakery delivery carts, bread trays, skids, pallets, milk carts, and milk crates.</p>

        <p> Returnable containers are designed and ordinarily used for more than one-time use as containers. They are customarily expected or required to be returned by customers for reuse. Vendors commonly require a deposit or payment by the customer with the understanding that the amount of the deposit will be refunded either in cash or in credit when the container is returned. Regardless of the condition or appearance of the container, it is a returnable container if the vendor requires a deposit or payment from the customer and if there is an express or implied agreement that the deposit will be refunded upon return of the container.</p>

      <p>The definition of production found in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.25">297A.25</a>, subdivision 9, includes the production of road building materials. When a manufacturer of road building materials purchases materials that will be used or consumed in the manufacturing of asphalt, bituminous mix, or other road building materials to be sold at retail, those purchases are not taxable. For purposes of this exemption, it does not matter that the road building materials will ultimately be sold for use in building parking lots and driveways. When that person sells the road building materials to someone who will use them to build or repair roads, or for any other nonexempt purpose, the entire sales price of the road building materials is subject to tax.</p>
      <p>When a person produces road building materials for the person's own use in building or repairing roads, including a contract to build or repair roads for others, the materials used to produced the road materials are not exempt as materials used or consumed in industrial production. Because the person puts them to that person's own use in building, improving, or repairing roads, that person is not selling the road building materials at retail, as required for the exemption, but is engaged in improving real property. That person must pay sales or use tax on any materials used to make the road building materials that the person is going to use.</p>

The tool or accessory that performs the work of the machine, including saw blades, grinding wheels, cutters, files, molds, dies, patterns, jigs, printing plates, and similar items, are also taxable unless exempted under subpart 9 as short-lived separate detachable units.</p>
      <p>Materials or fabrication labor purchased by a person engaged in agricultural or industrial production are taxable if used to manufacture or fabricate equipment, tools, or similar items which are not intended for resale, but for the person's own use in the production process. Examples of materials are plastic, metal, or wood used in making patterns or jigs, and sand used in making molds.

      <p>All three conditions must be satisfied before an item is exempt. The item must be used to produce personal property intended to be sold ultimately at retail. If the item is used for maintenance purposes, or to produce other tooling for in-house use, it is not exempt.

        <p> "Separate detachable units" means accessory tools, equipment, or short-lived items that are attached to machinery when being used. These items are generally purchased separately from the purchase of the basic machine and do not include the basic machine and its component parts such as belts, pulleys, gears, shafts, and bearings. Examples of items considered to be separate detachable units include, but are not limited to, drill bits, cutting tools, grinding wheels, abrasive and polishing belts, sheets and discs, taps, reamers, printing plates, saw blades, and certain dies, jigs, patterns, and molds; however, if these items are included in the purchase price of the basic machine, and their cost is not separately stated, they are considered as part of the basic machine and taxable. Subsequent replacement of these items is exempt. Hand tools such as hammers, pliers, clamps, wrenches, screwdrivers, crowbars, soldering irons, knives, and power hand tools, are not separate detachable units and are not exempt. Attachments to hand tools are considered separate detachable units only if similarly functioning items attached to machinery would be considered separate detachable units. Examples of hand tool attachments considered to be separate detachable units include drill bits, grinding wheels, sandpaper disks, and sawblades.</p>

        <p> "Used in producing a direct effect" means accessory tools, equipment, and other short-lived items that are used or consumed in industrial or agricultural production in a manner that directly causes a physical or chemical change upon or within the materials being processed. Examples of items within this exemption include, but are not limited to, drill bits, cutting tools, grinding wheels, abrasive and polishing belts, sheets and discs, taps, reamers, printing plates, saw blades, and certain dies, jigs, patterns, and molds. Examples of items not exempt under this provision are conveyor belts and rollers that only serve to move the product from place to place.</p>
        <p>The phrase "used in producing a direct effect upon the product" does not require a direct physical contact with the product. Items that do not come into contact with material being processed, and that are not the agents that by direct contact with the product produce physical or chemical changes, are considered to be used in producing a direct effect upon the product if their use serves the purpose of determining the shape, contour, configuration, content, or arrangement of content of the product, or any part of the product, being produced.</p>
        <p>Such items are considered to be used in producing a direct effect since the desired change in the material being acted upon is accomplished only by the combined effect of the items acting in conjunction with other items that actually have the direct physical contact with the product.</p>
        <p>Items that are used in creating and/or maintaining a condition that must prevail before a desired physical or chemical change can be effected on a product are not considered as being used to produce a direct effect; i.e., the physical or chemical change sought in the material being processed.</p>

        <p> "Ordinary useful life" means the life of accessory tools, equipment, and other short-lived items measured by continuous use in production under normal conditions of the user. Continuous use under "normal conditions of the user" means normal but continuous use during the producer's normal business hours. Items that would otherwise qualify that are not used continuously but would last less than 12 months if production required continuous use are exempt. For example, a producer, whose normal conditions include a 15-hour business day, six days a week, uses a mold which otherwise qualifies under items A and B. If the mold had been used continuously during the producer's normal business hours of 15 hours a day, it would have been exhausted in four months. The four months is the mold's ordinary useful life. The producer, however, only uses the item for short production runs, a few days at a time, so it will not wear out for two years. This item qualifies even though the length of time retained is more than 12 months, since the item would not last 12 months if used continuously during the producer's normal business hours. An "ordinary useful life of less than 12 months" can be shown by providing evidence that prior purchases of similar items had useful lives of less than 12 months.</p>
        <p>Junking, scrapping, wearing out, or disposing of the item is conclusive evidence of the end of its ordinary useful life. Keeping an item after it has been used is not evidence of continued useful life unless the item is reused or is held for reuse in the taxpayer's ordinary production process. Repair (as defined in part <a href="/rules/8130.0700">8130.0700</a>) of an item is not evidence of the end of that item's ordinary useful life. For example, when an item that has an ordinary useful life of two years needs a repair six months after it has been purchased, the repair does not mean the item's useful life is six months.</p>

      <p>The purchase of feed, feed additives, and feed supplements for use or consumption in agricultural or industrial production is exempt. Such feeds are used or consumed in agricultural or industrial production if they are fed to (1) agricultural animals raised for sale; (2) animals kept for use in agricultural production; (3) farm work stock; and (4) the following animals while they are being raised for sale on a commercial basis: fur-bearing animals, animals used as a source of wool, pets, and research animals. "Agricultural animals" means cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, dairy animals, poultry, honey bees, fish, or other animals that are commercially raised for sale. "Farm work stock" means animals, such as draft horses, mules, oxen, and herd dogs, which are used exclusively for farming. "Fur-bearing animal" means a fox, mink, fitch, chinchilla, karakul, marten, nutria, or fisher that is second or later generation raised in captivity. "Pet" means any domesticated animal normally maintained in or near the household of the owner and kept for affection and pleasure rather than for utility or profit. The purchase of feed is subject to tax if it is to be fed to animals that are not used or consumed in agricultural production, or to those animals, such as a pet or a riding horse, that are not being raised for sale on a commercial basis.</p>

      <p>Special tooling is exempt. "Special tooling" is defined in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.68">297A.68</a>, subdivision 6. Special tooling is tooling that is made to specific requirements to produce a part or a series of related parts, which are known at the time the special tooling is manufactured for a single customer. The special tooling itself must be unique. If the tooling is available from a catalog, other sales literature, or over-the-counter, the tooling is standard and not special tooling.</p>
      <p>Because special tooling does not need to produce a direct effect upon the product, nor does it need to have an ordinary useful life of less than 12 months, special tooling is usually different from accessory tools as defined in part <a href="/rules/8130.5500">8130.5500</a>, subpart 9, (separate detachable units). Certain special tooling may also be exempt from tax as separate detachable units or as accessory tools because the definitions are not exclusive. See subpart 3, item B.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Component parts. </h2>
      <p>Materials from which special tooling or component parts are produced by a seller of special tooling need not themselves be unique and useable only by the seller who produces special tooling. For example, metal used to produce special tooling need not be unique metal, only the special tooling produced from the metal needs to be unique. However, special tooling or components of special tooling must be unique, having value and use only for the buyer of special tooling.</p>
      <p>Special tooling comprised of components qualifies for the exemption to the extent of the purchase price of the unique components. Unique components are those components which are manufactured for the special tooling and are not standard or reusable. Components of special tooling which can be reused, either in special tooling or general applications, do not qualify for the exemption.</p>

        <p> Machine tools and machinery are usually frames and motors which, through tools and special tooling, perform an action on materials to produce a product. They are commonly purchased in a standard configuration and can be used to produce parts for more than one customer. Attachments to machine tools and machinery that are used with the machine tool or machinery generally are not produced in accordance with special requirements of the purchaser of special tooling and do not qualify for the special tooling exemption. They are not special tooling. Machine tools and machinery and their accessories can be used by any person other than the purchaser who wants to perform a function similar to the purchaser's.

        <p> Accessory tools, as included within the definition of separate detachable units, are typically standard items which are loaded into a machine tool or hand-held machine and which produce a direct effect on the product. The definitional conditions required of exempt accessory tools in part <a href="/rules/8130.5500">8130.5500</a> are that: they are separate detachable units; they are used in producing a direct effect upon the product; and they have an ordinary life of less than 12 months. These conditions are not the same as those for special tooling. Generally, accessory tools can be purchased from a catalog or over-the-counter without any special fabrication. Further, usually any person requiring the action of an accessory tool on a product can use the accessory tool, so it is not limited in use or value only to the buyer. For example, anyone who needs thread cut can use a tap, so it has general value and is not special tooling.</p>
        <p>Although an accessory tool usually does not qualify as special tooling, the statutory definitions do not preclude tangible personal property from qualifying as both an accessory tool and special tooling. If, for example, a cutting tool is made for a special purpose which is unique to a single customer, it qualifies both as an accessory tool and special tooling. Examples of tools that are usually accessory tools are:</p>

      <p>House organs, trade, professional, and other types of magazines and journals regularly issued at average intervals not exceeding three months are included within the meaning of "publication." "Comic books" are "publications" if published serially under the same title at least once quarterly; however, comic books complete in themselves and without continuity of title and subject matter are not publications.</p>

        <p> "Normal course of business" is defined in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.61#stat.297A.61.21">297A.61, subdivision 21</a>. The sale of inventory is considered to be made in the normal course of business and thus is subject to tax. The lease of tangible personal property is subject to tax.</p>
        <p>Example 1. A bank repossesses secured property. This is part of the bank's business. Repossessed items are considered to be inventory in possession of the bank and the sale by the bank is considered to be made during the normal course of business and is subject to tax.</p>
        <p>Example 2. A construction company leases excavating and hauling equipment without an operator to another business, when not otherwise in use. The leasing is considered to take place in the normal course of business and is subject to tax.</p>
        <p>Example 3. A luxury boat business sells one or two boats a year. The sales are taxable because, while the sales are infrequent, they are made in the normal course of business.</p>

        <p> "Occasional" means occurring at infrequent intervals, as incidental, or as casual; that is, as distinguished from events of a similar nature recurring with some degree of regularity.</p>
        <p>Example. A person has a garage sale once each year. The sale is considered to be occasional.</p>

        <p> "Trade or business" means any continuous and regular activity carried on for the production of income from selling goods or performing services. Organizations exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code, subchapter F, such as organizations exempt under section 501(c)(3), are only considered to be engaged in a trade or business to the extent the activity is unrelated to their exempt purposes. Government organizations, including public schools, are not considered to be engaged in a trade or business since most of their activities are conducted to further a public purpose. However, if the government entity makes sales of surplus equipment or other tangible personal property on a regular basis, it is considered to be engaged in a trade or business.</p>
        <p>Examples of a trade or business: apartment buildings or other rental property, home day care centers, farms, law offices, manufacturers, retail stores, and restaurants.</p>
        <p>Examples of entities that are not considered to be engaged in a trade or business: American Red Cross, churches, nonprofit hospitals, and government agencies.</p>
        <p>Example of an exempt organization engaging in a taxable activity: a nonprofit hospital also has a gift shop that sells taxable items to the general public. The gift shop is considered to be engaged in a trade or business. Sales of items used by the hospital, such as waiting room furniture, are not subject to tax because the hospital is not a business. However, sales of items used by the gift shop, such as shelves or computers used in the store, are taxable, unless one of the exclusions under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.68">297A.68</a>, subdivision 25, applies, since these activities are not related to the hospital's exempt purpose.</p>

        <p> "Primarily used" means used in the trade or business 50 percent or more of its operating time. If it is used less than 50 percent of the time in the trade or business, it is not used primarily in the trade or business and may qualify for the isolated or occasional sale exemption. The seller's use of the equipment is the determining factor. It does not matter how the buyer uses the item.</p>
        <p>Example. An owner of a lawn mower has a small business operation to mow the neighbors' yards. The lawn mower is used 60 percent of the time for the owner's lawn and 40 percent of the time for the neighbors' lawns. Since the mower is used less than 50 percent of the time in the owner's business, it is not considered to be used primarily in a trade or business.</p>

        <p> "Substantially all of the assets of a trade or business," as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.68#stat.297A.68.25">297A.68, subdivision 25</a>, paragraph (a), clause (5), or "substantially all of the property sold," as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.68#stat.297A.68.25">297A.68, subdivision 25</a>, paragraph (b), clause (1), means 90 percent or more of the total fair market value of tangible personal property and does not include property that is subject to an ad valorem property tax. It also includes the assets of a separate division, branch, or other identifiable segment of a business, if before the sale, the income and expenses attributable to the separate division, branch, or segment could be separately ascertained from the records. If the separate division, branch, or segment is leased or rented, rather than sold, the assets are taxable.</p>
        <p>Example. A company has a retail hardware business, as well as a building construction division. The records of the businesses are kept separately. The retail hardware business closes while the construction division continues to exist. The sale of all the assets of the hardware business is exempt from tax.

      <p>The following transactions are considered to be isolated or occasional sales because they are infrequent sales of a nonrecurring nature made by a person not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property or a service.</p>
      <p>Example 1. The sale of a used vacuum cleaner by one neighbor to another.</p>

      <p> A "garage sale or personal sale" is a sale by a person or persons selling their personal belongings. A garage sale or personal sale does not include flea markets, craft shows, antique shows, coin shows, stamp shows, comic book shows, convention exhibit areas, or similar selling events, as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.87">297A.87</a>. A garage sale includes moving sales, estate sales, and other similar sales. If a person does not regularly hold garage sales or personal sales and the items sold have not been collected or purchased for the purpose of resale, the sales are isolated or occasional. A person who collects or purchases items for resale is deemed to be in business, and must obtain a sales and use tax permit and collect and remit tax on sales of taxable items.</p>
      <p>If any trade or business assets are sold at the garage sale, sales tax is due on those items.</p>
      <p>Example 1. A person sells personal belongings at an annual neighborhood garage sale that was advertised through word-of-mouth, notices on a bulletin board, or an advertisement in the classified section of a newspaper. No sales tax applies.</p>
      <p>Example 2. A person sells new or used items that were purchased for the purpose of resale, as well as personal items, at a garage sale. The personal items include some children's toys and a lamp. The person is considered to be carrying on a trade or business and sales tax must be charged on all sales of taxable items that were purchased for resale. The sale of the lamp and the toys is not subject to tax.</p>

      <p>"Religious" refers to an institution that conducts worship services at regular intervals at an established place of worship that is owned, leased, or borrowed for that purpose, and organizations affiliated with or related to that institution, which exist exclusively for the furtherance of the religious purposes of the institution. The specific merits of a particular religion will not be compared or considered by the department when determining whether an organization is an exempt religious organization for purposes of the Minnesota sales and use tax. An organization claiming exempt status as a religious organization must be able to affirmatively establish its right to the exemption. Only if an organization clearly demonstrates that it is an organization created exclusively for religious purposes will it meet the requirements for tax-exempt status under Minnesota sales and use tax statutes. The criteria the department will use to determine whether an organization is a religious organization includes the criteria in items A to N. Each case must be decided on its own particular facts and it is not essential that every factor mentioned in items A to N be present for an organization to qualify as a religious organization.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Educational organization. </h2>
      <p>"Educational" means the instruction or training of individuals to improve or develop their capabilities, or the instruction of the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community. Examples of educational institutions are primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, and nonprofit professional and trade schools having a regularly scheduled curriculum, a regular faculty, and a regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at a place where the educational activities are regularly carried on. Educational organizations include PTA, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, YMCA, YWCA, 4-H Clubs, and youth athletic and recreational programs such as Little League. Other educational institutions include museums, zoos, planetariums, symphony orchestras, historical societies, and other similar organizations.</p>
      <p>An organization may be educational even though it advocates a particular position or viewpoint, so long as it presents a sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts as to permit an individual or the public to form an independent opinion or conclusion.</p>

      <p>An organization is not exempt as a charitable, religious, or educational organization for sales and use tax purposes unless it is exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.61">297A.61</a>, subdivision 22. However, the determination of the Internal Revenue Service that an organization is a nonprofit and tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code, section 501(c)(3), for purposes of income taxation is not controlling on the issue of whether the organization is an exempt organization for sales and use tax purposes. Likewise, determinations by the Minnesota Department of Revenue that an organization is an exempt organization for income tax purposes does not, by itself, entitle the organization to an exemption from payment of sales and use tax. In order to be an exempt organization, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes. The following tests will be used in determining whether or not an organization qualifies as an exempt organization:</p>

        <p> An exempt organization may not be organized or operated for the purpose of making a profit which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. The organization must be able to demonstrate by its articles of incorporation or if unincorporated, a certified copy of its constitution and bylaws, and its financial statements that:</p>

          <p> no part of the net earnings of its activities inures to the benefit of any private shareholder, or individual member, and no part of its assets will directly or indirectly be transferred, in the event of dissolution of a corporation or termination of an unincorporated association, to its members, founders, or shareholders;</p>

          <p> it is supported and maintained at least in part by gifts, grants, and contributions, that is, one of its sources of support is donations, income from donations, and contributions and dues of members for which they receive no direct benefit, or it is supported by fees charged by an exempt organization for program services if the fees are based on ability to pay and the exempt organization provides services to individuals who would otherwise turn to government for such aid. "Program services" means those activities that the exempt organization was created to conduct and which, along with any activities commenced subsequently, form the basis of the organization's current exemption from tax.</p>
          <p>The fact that an organization may receive voluntary contributions from those who benefit from its activities will not necessarily prevent its being an exempt organization. But if it is determined that the services rendered by the organization are conditioned upon the receipt of a contribution the services rendered may be regarded as a commercial activity. If this commercial activity is not subordinate to or incidental to the organization's charitable, religious, or educational activities, the organization does not qualify as an exempt organization since it is not organized or operated exclusively for exempt purposes.</p>
          <p>The fact that an organization is nonprofit does not necessarily make it an exempt organization. The following are examples of nonprofit organizations that may not qualify for exemption: organizations attempting to influence legislation or participating in political campaigns; fraternal or beneficial societies; clubs organized and operated for pleasure, recreation, social, or other similar purposes; business associations; cemetery associations that are not owned by religious organizations; civic and business clubs; homeowner's associations; lake improvement associations; professional and trade associations; retail and credit trade associations; trade unions; volunteer employee benefit associations; and veterans organizations. Thus, such organizations as Masons, Knights of Columbus, B'nai B'rith, League of Women Voters, Chambers of Commerce, American Legion, alumni clubs, computer clubs, fraternities and sororities, Jaycees, Lions Clubs, Odd Fellows, Orders of Eastern Star, ski clubs, unions, and VFW Posts are not exempt organizations.</p>

        <p> An exempt organization must serve a public rather than a private interest. Thus, to gain exemption an organization must establish that it is not organized or operated for the benefit of private interests such as designated individuals, the founder or organizer or their family, shareholders of the organization, or persons controlled directly or indirectly by such private interests. An organization which is organized or operated primarily for the benefit of its individual nonexempt members rather than for the benefit of the general welfare does not qualify for exemption.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">General rule. </h2>
      <p>Ordinarily, a deduction for uncollectible debts is allowed only for a person who is reporting on the accrual method of accounting for sales and use tax purposes. However, if a cash basis taxpayer accepts an unsecured check in payment for a sale, reports the sale, and subsequently determines that the check is uncollectible, the taxpayer is entitled to an uncollectible debt deduction. In addition, a certified service provider may claim a bad debt allowance on behalf of the provider's client. Uncollectible debts (commonly referred to as bad debts) will be recognized as a deduction for sales tax purposes only when given recognition by a direct charge-off for federal income tax purposes or, if the retailer is not required to file income tax returns, charged off in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, no anticipatory or statistical method of estimating future uncollectible debts will be allowed by the commissioner. See Minnesota Statutes, sections <a href="/statutes/cite/289A.50">289A.50</a>, subdivision 2b, and <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.81">297A.81</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Deduction determination. </h2>
      <p>If a debt becomes uncollectible, either in whole or in part, in a reporting period subsequent to the period in which the transaction that gave rise to the uncollectible debt occurred, the retailer may deduct the uncollectible debt from the gross receipts for the reporting period in which the uncollectible debt is determined to be uncollectible in accordance with the following rules.</p>

        <p> If the uncollectible debt arose in respect of a sale required to be included in gross receipts, subject to a tax imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Law, the entire amount of the debt remaining uncollected is allowed as a deduction.</p>

        <p> If the uncollectible debt arose in respect of a sale partly subject to the tax imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Law and partly exempt thereunder, the amount of the uncollectible debt allowed as a deduction is the amount derived by multiplying the uncollectible debt by the percentage that the taxable sale bears to the total sales.</p>

        <p> If the uncollectible debt arose in respect of two or more sales made at successive intervals, payments made before the date the debt became uncollectible must be applied, first to the earliest sale upon which there is an unpaid balance, and to following sales in successive order.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Excess carryover. </h2>
      <p>In the event that the seller is entitled to an uncollectible debt deduction in excess of the amount the seller is required to report for the month in which the debt is determined to be uncollectible, the balance of the deduction may be used in a subsequent month.</p>

      <p>"Electronic data processing records" include punched cards, magnetic tapes, magnetic disk packs, computer disks, and other machine-sensible data media used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting transactions and records within a taxpayer's electronic data processing system. These records are required to be retained so long as their contents may be material in the administration of any provision of the Sales and Use Tax Law. The commissioner shall decide the materiality of any such records, and if the materiality of any record is questionable, then the record must be retained. It is not required that taxpayers retain the same data on two or more machine-sensible media. If there is a duplication of data between two or more electronic data processing media, the taxpayer must maintain a complete set of all the records on at least one of the media.</p>
      <p>These requirements apply to any taxpayer who maintains any records on an electronic data processing media. The records to be maintained are as follows.</p>

          <p>Any taxpayer retaining disbursement or revenue records on electronic data processing records for any individual original transactions, or any summary of the transactions subject to the tax under the provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Law must separately show the amount of sales tax paid or the amount of sales tax collected. It is permissible, however, to group all taxable sales or all taxable purchases into various accounts, all of which are taxable, providing that if a nontaxable transaction is combined with a taxable transaction in the same account, then, with respect to each individual transaction, the tax is separately shown in the electronic data processing record.</p>
          <p>An electronic data processing system must include a method of producing visible and legible paper records from the electronic data processing records which will provide the necessary information for verification of the taxpayer's tax liability.</p>
          <p>Production of these paper records does not eliminate the necessity of maintaining the corresponding electronic data processing records as required by the first paragraph of this subpart.</p>

          <p> Since July 1, 1984, the sales and use tax on capital equipment is initially paid at the six percent rate. In order to obtain the refund of sales and use tax paid on the purchases of qualifying capital equipment, the purchaser must file a claim for refund form with the commissioner. The claim is filed with the Business Trust Tax Unit, Department of Revenue. No adjustment for the tax paid on capital equipment will be allowed as credit against tax due on current sales and use tax returns being filed by a Minnesota sales and use tax permit holder.</p>
          <p>Refund claims may include more than one purchase of machinery or equipment. However, no more than two claims will be accepted from a purchaser in a calendar year. See Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.15">297A.15</a>, subdivision 5.</p>
          <p>Interest on capital equipment refunds or credits begins to accrue on the date the claim is filed. See Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/289A.56">289A.56</a>, subdivision 4. For purposes of calculating the interest due, a claim is not considered filed until sufficient documentation to process the claim is submitted to the commissioner.</p>
          <p>When filing a claim for refund for purchases of qualifying capital equipment, the purchaser must provide sufficient documentation to substantiate the allowance of the requested refund. The following information must be submitted with the completed claim for refund form:</p>

      <p>The veterinarian is primarily engaged in the business of rendering professional services to the owners of animals, through care, medication, and treatment of such animals. The veterinarian is the user and consumer of all tangible personal property such as drugs, medicines, bandages and dressings, serums, tonics, and vitamins used in connection with the performance of services unless the veterinarian bills the customer separately for the services rendered and the materials used in the course of rendering such services. Except for the agricultural production exemptions provided in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.69">297A.69</a>, and except as provided otherwise in this part, the veterinarian must pay sales or use tax on items used to provide services and must collect and report sales tax on retail sales of taxable goods and services.</p>

      <p>Retail sales by the veterinarian of tangible personal property and taxable services that are not used or consumed in agricultural production or are not used to provide a taxable service are taxable. For example, worm pills sold for treatment of the family pet dog would be taxable. The veterinarian may accept exemption certificates from persons engaged in agricultural production, or in the boarding, breeding, raising, owning, or keeping of horses, or in providing taxable services such as pet grooming or the furnishing of lodging, board, and care services for animals, for retail sales of items that are used or consumed in those endeavors.</p>

      <p>If the veterinarian administers a drug, medicine, or supply to an animal other than an agricultural production animal or horse and merely charges for services and absorbs the cost of drugs and other materials in a service charge, no tax should be charged by the veterinarian. The veterinarian is the consumer of such drugs and materials and the sale of the drugs or material by the supplier to the veterinarian is a taxable retail sale. If the veterinarian both sells a drug, medicine, or supply and administers it to an animal other than an agricultural production animal or horse, and also separately states the charges for such items and the charge for the veterinary service, then the sale of such drugs and materials by the veterinarian is a taxable retail sale. The veterinarian may purchase these items exempt for resale and must charge tax on the sales price to the customer. "Administers" means the item is injected, fed, or applied to the animal.</p>

        <p> Boarding services for horses are not taxable. For other animals, boarding services provided by a veterinarian are not taxable if the boarding service is for medical reasons - that is, hospitalization, observation, or other veterinary purposes. "Other veterinary purposes" does not include administering medication to a pet when the pet owner normally could administer the medication. If administering such medication is the sole service provided by the veterinarian aside from boarding, then the boarding service is taxable. However, if the veterinarian not only administers medication which the pet owner normally could administer, but also boards the pet for hospitalization, observation, or other veterinary purposes, then the boarding service is not taxable.</p>

      <p>Commercial artists and photographers engaged in the creation or production of art work for sale to advertisers, printers, and others for reproduction, display, or use in the preparation or production of advertising or industrial materials, designs, etc., are regarded as retailers for sales and use tax purposes. Consequently, sales by them of drawings, sketches, paintings, illustrations, photographs, motion picture films, audio and video tapes, negatives, transparencies, mats, plates, engravings, designs, lettering, signs, show cards, posters, assemblies (key lining and paste-ups), and all other forms of tangible personal property are subject to the sales and use tax, whether or not the materials utilized are furnished by the customer. The tax applies to the total price charged, including amounts attributable to personal services of models, assistants, etc., and to preliminary art which becomes physically incorporated into finished art as for example, when the finished art is made by inking directly over a pencil sketch or drawing. Separately stated charges for preliminary art, in the form of roughs, visualizations, comprehensives, and layouts, when the preliminary art does not become physically incorporated into finished art shall be considered charges for services and not subject to tax.</p>

        <p> "Advertising" is the expression of an idea created and produced for reproduction and distribution through means such as television, radio, newspapers, newsletters, periodicals, trade journals, publications, books, magazines, standardized outdoor billboards, direct mail, point-of-sale displays, leaflets, brochures, fliers, and package design, and which is designed to promote sales of a particular product or service or to enhance the general image of the advertiser. Advertising includes public service messages that are designed to affect the behavior of the public, and messages that are political in nature.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">In general. </h2>
      <p>The sale, use, or other consumption (hereinafter referred to as a sale) of advertising ordinarily constitutes a sale of a nontaxable service, and hence is not subject to Minnesota sales or use tax. However, if the means of expressing the advertising is through tangible personal property that has a primary functional use independent of its advertising message, the sale of the advertising will be treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property. It shall be presumed that the advertising has a primary functional use independent of its advertising message, and the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that the advertising does not have a primary functional use independent of its advertising message.</p>
      <p>If a person creates advertising for its own use, all of its purchases of tangible personal property are subject to sales tax. This part, with the exception of subparts 11 and 13, does not apply to such a person. For purposes of subparts 11 and 13, such person shall be treated as an advertiser.</p>

Examples of preliminary art, film, or tape include roughs, visualizations, comprehensives, layouts, sketches, drawings, paintings, designs, story boards, rough cuts of film and tape, initial audio and visual tracks, and work prints. In the case of print advertising, finished art is the final art used for actual reproduction by photochemical or other process. In the case of broadcast advertising, finished film and tape means the master tape or film and duplicate prints. Gross receipts are treated as allocable to preliminary art only to the extent that they are separately billed or stated.</p>

      <p>This subpart applies to purchases by an advertising agency of tangible personal property which may used repeatedly, and to tangible personal property which is consumed in part for producing nontaxable advertising and in part for producing taxable advertising.</p>
      <div id="rule.8130.9250.8.A" class="item">

        <p> If an advertising agency purchases tangible personal property which is used, but not consumed, with respect to both nontaxable advertising and taxable advertising, the determination of whether the purchase is exempt from sales or use tax is based on the initial contract for which the property is purchased. An example of such tangible personal property is a photograph that may be used in connection with both nontaxable advertising services such as a newspaper ad, and taxable advertising such as a mug.</p>
        <p>If the initial contract with the advertiser is for nontaxable advertising, the purchase by the advertising agency is subject to sales or use tax, notwithstanding that the purchased property may later be used with respect to taxable advertising. The subsequent sale of taxable advertising using such tangible personal property is not exempt from sales and use tax because of the previous tax payment.</p>
        <p>If the initial contract with the advertiser is for taxable advertising, the item purchased by the advertising agency may be purchased exempt for resale, notwithstanding that the purchased tangible personal property may later be used with respect to nontaxable advertising.</p>
        <p>If a contract (or contemporaneously negotiated contracts) with an advertiser is for both taxable advertising and nontaxable advertising, the burden is on the advertising agency to demonstrate the portion of the use that is attributable to each of such categories. If this burden is not met, the contract with the advertiser is deemed to be for nontaxable advertising. An example of this rule may be artwork purchased and used initially in making both a magazine ad and in making a calendar. Where the burden of proof is not met by the advertising agency, the purchase is taxable and the subsequent sale of taxable advertising is not exempt because of the previous tax payment.</p>

        <p> If an advertising agency expects to consume materials in producing both nontaxable advertising and taxable advertising, all such materials can be purchased exempt for resale. An example of such material is a ream of paper that may be used in connection with the production of nontaxable advertising such as a brochure, and taxable advertising such as a calendar. To the extent that the materials are subsequently consumed in producing nontaxable advertising, the materials are taxable and must be reported as purchases subject to use tax on the agency's sales and use tax return. The percentage of materials consumed in producing nontaxable advertising is multiplied by the total purchase price of the materials to determine the amount of materials subject to tax. The burden is on the taxpayer to demonstrate the portion of usage that is attributable to taxable advertising. If the burden is not met, all the materials consumed are deemed to be for nontaxable advertising.</p>

The agency may issue exemption certificates as authorized in part <a href="/rules/8130.3000">8130.3000</a> in the name of the principal and signed by the advertising agency as purchasing agent.</p>

      <h2 class="subp_no">Subp. 11.</h2>
      <h2 class="headnote">Advertising materials shipped out of state. </h2>
      <p>Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.68">297A.68</a>, subdivision 11, exempts materials designed to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services, which material is shipped out of Minnesota for use solely outside the state. This exemption may apply to the purchase of items in final form or to the purchase of an item that is incorporated into a product that ultimately leaves the state. Similarly, the exemption may apply to the purchase of taxable advertising or to the purchase of tangible personal property that is used in creating or producing nontaxable advertising.</p>
      <p>This exemption is limited to materials used to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services. This exemption does not include any advertising which is done for other purposes such as public service messages not related to advertising or promoting sales of merchandise or services.</p>
      <p>When an advertising agency or an advertiser purchases taxable advertising and the advertising agency, the retailer, or the advertiser ships the taxable advertising out of state for use solely outside the state, the advertising agency or advertiser is not subject to sales or use tax with respect to such purchases because it is the purchaser of materials that are designed to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services, and the materials are being shipped outside the state for use solely out of state.</p>
      <p>When an advertising agency or an advertiser purchases tangible personal property that is used in creating or producing nontaxable advertising, and the advertising agency, the retailer, or the advertiser ships the advertising out of state for use solely outside the state, the advertising agency or advertiser is not subject to sales or use tax with respect to such purchases because it is the purchaser of materials that are designed to advertise and promote the sale of merchandise or services, and the materials are being shipped outside the state for use solely outside the state. An example of this is when an advertising agency or advertiser purchases advertising brochures that will be shipped out of state. The agency or advertiser can purchase the brochures from the printer exempt from tax. The printer can purchase the paper and ink used to print the brochures exempt because they are being purchased for resale, whether or not the advertising agency or advertiser has an exemption for shipments out of state. The advertising agency or the advertiser is eligible for the exemption described in this subpart whether the item it purchases is in final form, such as a finished brochure or whether the item is incorporated into the product that ultimately leaves the state, such as cardboard that is purchased and becomes part of an advertising sign that is shipped out of state.</p>
      <p>The rules described in this subpart also apply with respect to an advertising agency if the advertising agency, instead of itself shipping the advertising directly out of state, delivers the advertising to an advertiser within Minnesota for the purpose of subsequently shipping the materials out of state for use solely outside the state. Similarly, the purchase by the advertiser is not subject to sales or use tax with respect to its purchase of the advertising.</p>
      <p>This exemption does not apply to purchases that are used to create or produce nontaxable advertising to the extent that these purchases do not get sent outside the state. An example of this is when an advertising agency purchases a photograph that it uses in preparing advertising brochures. The sale of the photograph to the advertising agency is taxable. The sale of the brochures to the advertising agency is exempt to the extent that those brochures will be sent out of state as described in this subpart. Another example is when an advertising agency purchases a master tape that it uses to make copies that will be shipped out of state. The copies or the materials used to make them may be purchased exempt but the purchase price of the master tape is taxable unless that tape is also shipped out of state as described in this subpart.</p>

      <h2 class="subp_no">Subp. 12.</h2>
      <h2 class="headnote">Miscellaneous provisions. </h2>
      <p>When an advertising agency contracts with a recording studio to produce a tape to be used for nontaxable advertising, the recording studio must charge sales tax on all charges to the agency. If the agency hires actors, or directly purchases other exempt services to be used in making the tape, the agency does not pay tax on those purchases. The recording studio only collects tax on the charges it makes to the agency.</p>
      <p>If a recording studio or printer has contracted directly with the advertiser to produce a tape or printed material, the studio or printer must charge tax on the amount charged to the advertiser, unless the studio or printer is also doing creative work and is acting as an advertising agency. If the studio or printer is acting as an advertising agency, it must pay tax on all its inputs for nontaxable advertising, and does not collect tax on its charges to the advertiser.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Production process. </h2>
      <p>In the case of mining, the production process shall be deemed to begin with the removal of overburden from the site of the ore deposit and to end when the last process prior to stockpiling is performed.

      <h2 class="headnote">In general. </h2>
      <p>A sales or use tax is imposed upon the gross receipts from selling, leasing, or granting a license to use tangible personal property. When separately stated, the labor charges for repair, service, and maintenance of tangible personal property is not subject to tax. The producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting of tangible personal property for a consideration for consumers who directly or indirectly furnish the materials used in the producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting is also subject to tax. The transfer of property produced, fabricated, or printed to the special order of the customer is also subject to tax.</p>
      <p>This part sets forth guidelines for the application of the general statutory provisions to transfers of property and service rendered in the automatic data processing industry.</p>
      <p>"Automatic data processing services" are those rendered in performing all or part of a series of data processing operations through an interacting assembly of procedures, processes, methods, personnel, and automatic data processing equipment. Automatic data processing services may be provided by manufacturers of data processing equipment, data processing centers, systems designers, consultants, software companies, etc. In addition, there are banks and other businesses which own or lease automatic data processing equipment and use it primarily for their own purposes but occasionally provide services to others. Businesses rendering automatic data processing services will be referred to as "service bureaus."</p>

        <p> Leases of equipment are subject to tax. A lease includes a contract by which a lessee secures for a consideration the use of equipment which may or may not be on the lessee's premises if the lessee or the lessee's employees operate the equipment, or if the equipment is operated under the direction and control of the lessee or the lessee's employees. Subleasing receipts are taxable without any deduction or credit for tax paid by the original lessee to the lessor, if the original lessee uses the property in addition to subleasing it. Use of equipment on a time-sharing basis, where access to the equipment is only by means of remote access facilities, is not a taxable leasing of such equipment.</p>

        <p> When additional copies of records, reports, or tabulations are provided, tax applies to the charges made for the additional copies. "Additional copies" are all copies in excess of those produced on multipart carbon paper simultaneous with the production of the original and on the same printer, whether the copies are prepared by rerunning the same program, by using multiple simultaneous printers, by looping a program such that the program is run continuously, by using different programs to produce the same output product, or by other means. Where additional copies are prepared, the tax will be measured by the charge made by the service bureau to the customer. Charges for copies produced by means of photocopying, multilithing, or by other means are also subject to tax.</p>

        <p> Sales of mailing lists in the form of cheshire tapes, gummed labels, and heat transfers produced as a result of a computer run are taxable. However, computer-generated mailing lists alone involving no transferable product are not taxable. Where the service bureau, through the use of its automatic data processing equipment, addresses material to be mailed, with names and addresses furnished by the customer or maintained by the service bureau for the customer, tax does not apply to the charge for addressing. Similarly, where the service bureau prepares labels to be affixed to material to be mailed, with names and addresses furnished by the customer or maintained by the service bureau for the customer, tax does not apply to the charge for producing the labels, when the service bureau itself affixes the labels to the material to be mailed.</p>

        <p> "Processing a client's data" means the developing of original information from raw data furnished by the customer. Examples of automatic data processing operations which result in original information are summarizing, computing, extracting, sorting, and sequencing. Such operations also include the updating of a continuous file of information maintained by the customer with the service bureau.</p>
        <p>Generally, if a person enters into a contract to process a client's data by the use of a computer program, or through an electrical accounting machine programmed by a wired plugboard, the contracts are nontaxable (except if the contract is in the nature of a lease as outlined in subpart 3, item B). Such contracts usually provide that the person will receive the client's source documents, record data in machine-readable form (such as in punch cards or on magnetic tape), make necessary corrections, rearrange or create new information as the result of the processing, and then provide tabulated listings or record output on other media. This service is considered nontaxable even if the total charge is broken down into specific charges for each step. The furnishing of computer programs and data by the client for processing under direction and control of the person providing the service is nontaxable even though charges may be based on computer time. The true object of these contracts is considered to be a service, even though some tangible personal property is incidentally transferred to the client.</p>
        <p>"Processing a client's data" does not include:</p>

        <p> Keypunching and keystroke verifying is an item which covers situations where a service bureau's agreement provides only for keypunching, keystroke verifying, and proof listing of data or any combination of these operations. It does not include contracts under which these services are performed as steps in processing a client's data as described in item A.</p>
        <p>Agreements providing for keypunching and keystroke verification, or keypunching, providing a proof list, and/or verification of data are not regarded as contracts for the fabrication of punch cards and sales of proof lists. Charges therefore are not taxable, whether the cards are furnished by the customer or by the service bureau. Data from source documents may also be recorded directly on magnetic tape (off-line). This operation may include keystroke verifying and/or proof listing of data and is comparable to the punch card operation. Charges for this operation are not taxable whether the magnetic tapes are furnished by the customer or by the service bureau. No tax applies to charges for the imprinting of characters on a document to be used as the input medium in an optical character recognition system. The tax treatment is the same even though paper tape or other medium were used in the operation.</p>
