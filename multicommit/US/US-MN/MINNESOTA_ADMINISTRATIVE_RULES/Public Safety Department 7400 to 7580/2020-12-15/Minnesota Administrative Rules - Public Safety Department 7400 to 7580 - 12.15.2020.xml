                <p>The registrar shall deny a temporary motor vehicle dealer license and a motor vehicle dealer license for any of the following reasons:</p>
                <p>A. The application or the items filed with the application do not meet the requirements of parts 7400.0200 and 7400.0300.</p>
                <p>B. A person named on the application was an owner, officer, or board member of a dealer whose license was revoked under part 7400.1600 or 7400.1900. After the revocation period has elapsed, an applicant is not disqualified from being licensed.</p>
                <p>C. A person named on the application has been enjoined or convicted for a violation listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 168.27, subdivision 11. An applicant is not disqualified from being licensed if the applicant can show that the person has met the conditions of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 364.</p>
                <p>D. The applicant's established place of business does not meet the requirements of parts 7400.4000 to 7400.4300 and Minnesota Statutes, section 168.27, subdivision 10.</p>
                <p>E. The commissioner of revenue notifies the registrar under Minnesota Statutes, section 270C.72, that the applicant owes the state delinquent taxes, penalties, or interest.</p>
                <p>F. The registrar has sufficient cause to believe that the applicant, while holding a temporary dealer license, has committed a violation that is grounds for revocation under part 7400.1600 or 7400.1900, suspension under part 7400.1700 or 7400.1900, or cancellation under part 7400.1800.</p>
                <p>G. The registrar is unable to verify the applicant's compliance with location or record keeping requirements because the applicant has not given the registrar access to the location or records after a request by the registrar under part 7400.4300, subpart 2.</p>

                  <p>Revocation is the long-term withdrawal of a dealer license under Minnesota Statutes, section 168.27, subdivision 12. The registrar shall revoke a dealer license when there is sufficient cause to believe that the dealer has been convicted of a crime, has been enjoined due to a violation, has committed an act, or has failed to perform a duty as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. The dealer is convicted of violating or is enjoined due to a violation of Minnesota Statutes, section 325F.69.</p>
                  <p>B. The dealer is convicted of violating the Minnesota odometer law, Minnesota Statutes, section 325E.14, 325E.15, or 325E.16, or the federal odometer law, United States Code, title 15, sections 1981 to 1991, as amended through December 31, 1984.</p>
                  <p>C. The dealer is convicted of a gross misdemeanor or felony under Minnesota Statutes, section 609.53, for receiving or selling stolen vehicles or stolen parts.</p>
                  <p>D. The dealer is convicted of a felony related to the business of buying or selling motor vehicles or motor vehicle parts.

                  <p>A dealer license is not valid during a suspension. When a dealer license is suspended, the dealer shall immediately surrender the dealer license certificate, all dealer license plates, and all temporary vehicle permits. After a suspension period ends, the registrar shall return the dealer license certificate, dealer license plates, and temporary vehicle permits. A suspension period ends after the last day of the period regardless of whether this day falls on a Saturday or legal holiday. The suspension period is as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. The suspension period is seven days, if there are no suspensions under subpart 1 on the dealer's record within the past five years. The suspension period may be shortened if mitigating circumstances indicate that a shorter suspension period is appropriate. The suspension period must be at least three days.</p>
                  <p>B. The suspension period is 14 days, if there is one suspension under subpart 1 on the dealer's record within the past five years. The suspension period may be shortened if mitigating circumstances indicate that a shorter suspension period is appropriate. The suspension period must be at least seven days.</p>
                  <p>C. The suspension period is 28 days, if there are two suspensions under subpart 1 on the dealer's record within the past five years. The suspension period may be shortened if mitigating circumstances indicate that a shorter suspension period is appropriate. The suspension period must be at least 14 days.</p>
                  <p>D. When a suspension period is shortened based on mitigating circumstances, the registrar shall in writing identify the mitigating circumstances and give the reason for shortening the suspension period.</p>
                  <p>E. The suspension of a dealer license is on the record of the suspended dealer. The suspension of a dealer license is also on the record of another dealer if an owner, officer, or board member of the other dealer was an owner, officer, or board member of the suspended dealer at the time of the acts leading to the suspension.</p>
                  <p>F. When a suspension is imposed for a continuing violation, the suspension must last until the suspension period determined under items A to E expires or until the violation is corrected, whichever is later.</p>

The dealer holds a new motor vehicle dealer, used motor vehicle dealer, vehicle salvage pool, motor vehicle lessor, motor vehicle wholesaler, or motor vehicle auctioneer license and the dealer fails to have a surety bond as required by Minnesota Statutes, section 168.27, subdivision 24.</p>
                  <p>B. The dealer fails to provide or maintain the insurance required under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 65B.</p>
                  <p>C. The dealer pays its dealer license fee with a negotiable instrument that is not honored by the financial institution on which it is drawn.</p>
                  <p>D. The dealer's established place of business fails to meet the requirements of parts 7400.4000 to 7400.4300 and Minnesota Statutes, section 168.27, subdivision 10.</p>
                  <p>E. An owner, officer, or board member of the dealer is an owner, officer, or board member of another licensed dealer whose license is revoked. The registrar shall not cancel a license if the revocation period has elapsed.</p>
                  <p>F. A person is added as an owner, officer, or board member of the dealer and the person has been enjoined or convicted for a violation listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 168.27, subdivision 11. If the dealer can show that the person has met the conditions of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 364, the registrar shall not cancel the license.</p>

                  <p>B. The estimated number of applications a proposed office location processes annually must be at least 12,000 within two years after the establishment of the office. The commissioner shall estimate the number of applications as 30 percent of the applications processed within the preceding calendar year by existing offices and state-operated application sites located within a radius of the proposed office location of over ten miles and less than 19 miles.</p>
                  <p>C. The commissioner shall not consider the proposed office location if the use of the percentage of applications processed by an existing office or state-operated application site to establish a proposed office would reduce the number of applications to less than:</p>

If a percentage of applications processed by an existing office or state-operated application site was used to establish a new office, that percentage may not be used again in consideration of another proposed office within a two-year period. The two-year period starts from the date the agent was appointed.</p>
                  <p>E. The commissioner shall not consider a proposed office location if the proposed office location is within a 20-mile radius of an existing office or state-operated application site established within the last two years.

                  <p>When the commissioner proposes an office location, notice of the proposed office location must be made to existing licensing agents.</p>
                  <p>A. If the proposed office location complies with the distance and projected application numbers in part 7404.0300, the commissioner shall publish notice of the proposed office location once in a qualified newspaper in the county where the proposed office is located. The notice must specify the:</p>
                  <p>(1) site of the proposed office;</p>
                  <p>(2) commissioner's intent to appoint an agent at that location and request applications;</p>
                  <p>(3) responsibility of the agent to accept applications;</p>
                  <p>(4) commissioner's authority under statute and rule to make the appointment;</p>
                  <p>(5) name, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and e-mail address of the individual to contact about the appointment; and</p>
                  <p>(6) deadline, at least 14 days after the date the notice appears, for submitting the application to the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>B. The process for appointing an agent at the proposed office location shall follow the applicable procedures in parts 7404.0360 and 7404.0370.</p>
                  <p>C. If the commissioner's proposed office location is within the distances specified in part 7404.0300 from an existing licensing agent's office, the commissioner shall:</p>
                  <p>(1) notify each existing licensing agent with an approved office within the distance radius that the commissioner has proposed to accept applications at the proposed office location; and</p>
                  <p>(2) request the existing licensing agent to either operate the new office location or move to the site.</p>
                  <p>D. If more than one existing licensing agent is within the distance radius of the commissioner's proposed office location, the commissioner shall consider appointment of a licensing agent in order of the agent office closest to the proposed location.</p>
                  <p>E. If all agents within the distance radius decline the appointment to operate the new office location, then the commissioner shall proceed to appoint an agent for the office following the procedures in item A.</p>
                  <p>F. Nothing in this part prevents a state-operated application site from opening at a location for public convenience or the efficient and effective delivery of state services.</p>

                  <p>(1) $1,000 or the value of all state-issued inventory, whichever amount is greater; plus</p>
                  <p>(2) $3,000 for every $50,000 of annual application receipts or portion thereof.</p>
                  <p>D. The amount of application receipts for an initial bond must be based on the highest projected amount of annual application receipts in the five years after an agent is appointed as the number of applications for a new office is estimated under part 7404.0300.</p>
                  <p>E. For an initial appointment, the bond shall be adjusted after the first 24 months of office operation.</p>
                  <p>F. The continuous bond must be adjusted every five years, starting with the date of initial issuance for an existing office, or starting with the date after the 24-month adjustment for a new office, to reflect the total annual application receipt amount and inventory value of the previous calendar year.</p>

                  <p>A. The number of calendar days for which payment is late begins on the date on the late payment charge notice. The late payment notice must be issued by certified mail and contain the information specified in subpart 5.</p>

                  <p>D. If a variance is granted for office closure, the agent must provide notice to the public at the agent's office of the dates and times of the office closure.</p>
                  <p>E. If the office is to be closed for four working days or less, the agent must post notice in a conspicuous place inside and outside the office for up to two consecutive weeks before closure.</p>
                  <p>F. If the office is to be closed for five or more working days, the notice must be posted at the office and also published in a qualified newspaper or aired on a radio station in the county or city in which the office is located.</p>
                  <p>(1) The notice must be published at least two weeks before the closing for two consecutive weeks, or a shorter time as approved by the commissioner.</p>

A variance to subpart 8a does not include a variance to the technology requirements in part 7404.0400, subpart 4, item I. Application for a variance may be made by submitting a written request to the commissioner according to this subpart. The commissioner shall consider the following factors when reviewing the request for a variance:</p>

                <p>(1) for an initial deputy registrar appointment must be either $10,000 or the projected amount of motor vehicle taxes and fees estimated to be collected in a two-day period based on the transaction estimates under part 7406.0300, whichever amount is greater; or</p>
                <p>(2) for an existing office must be either $10,000 or an amount sufficient to cover two days of average daily receipts of motor vehicle taxes and fees collected during the previous state fiscal year, whichever amount is greater.</p>
                <p>E. The bond must be rounded up to the nearest $5,000 increment.</p>
                <p>F. For an initial appointment, the bond must be adjusted after the first 24 months of office operation and must be based on the two-day average amount of motor vehicle taxes and fees collected during the previous year of operation.</p>
                <p>G. All bonds must be adjusted every five years, starting with the date of initial issuance for an existing office, or starting with the date after the 24th month adjustment for a new office. The five-year adjustment must reflect the two-day average daily amount of motor vehicle taxes and fees during the previous two calendar years.</p>

                  <p>For each subsequent violation of subpart 3 or 3a after a warning notice has been issued, the commissioner shall impose a late payment charge of $30 or an amount computed by the following formula, whichever is greater.</p>
                  <p>A. The number of calendar days for which payment is late begins on the date on the late payment charge notice. The late payment notice must be issued by certified mail and contain the information specified in subpart 6.</p>
                  <p>B. Calendar days late x delinquent amount x daily rate = Late payment charge where:</p>

The request for review must be submitted within ten days from the date the notice of late payment charge was issued. The commissioner shall review the materials and notify the deputy registrar within ten days of receipt of the request for review, whether the late payment charge will be affirmed or rescinded.

                  <p>An office must be open for at least 40 hours each week unless the commissioner grants a variance to allow an office to be closed for a specified period of time. To request a variance for closure of an office for two days or more, the deputy registrar shall submit a written request on a form prescribed by the commissioner. Under the variance procedure, the commissioner shall consider the following factors before allowing an office to close:</p>
                  <p>A. reason the closure is requested;</p>
                  <p>B. length of time the closure is requested;</p>

                  <p>D. number of transactions that an office processes on an annual basis and number of transactions that are processed at the requested time of closure, if known;</p>
                  <p>E. ability to keep the office open with current, additional, or temporary staff; and</p>
                  <p>F. number of variances granted that year.</p>
                  <p>The commissioner shall review the information submitted with the variance request and grant or deny the variance within two business days after receipt of the request.</p>
                  <p>If a variance is granted for closure of an office, the deputy registrar must provide notice to the public at the deputy registrar office of the dates and times of the office closure. If the office is to be closed for four days or less, the deputy registrar must post notice in a conspicuous place inside and outside the office for up to two consecutive weeks before closure. If the office is to be closed for five or more days, the notice must be posted at the office and also published in a qualified newspaper or on a radio station in the county or city in which the office is located. The notice must be published at least two weeks before the closing for two consecutive weeks, or a shorter time as approved by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>The notice of closure must contain the dates and times that the office will be closed and the location and address of the nearest office where alternative service can be obtained.</p>

If a variance is granted for closure of an office, the deputy registrar must provide notice to the public, as soon as practicable, at the deputy registrar office of the dates and times of the office closure. If the closure of an office is for more than one day, the deputy registrar must follow the variance procedures set forth in subpart 2a.</p>

Application for a variance may be made by submitting a written request to the commissioner according to this subpart. The commissioner shall consider the following factors when reviewing the request for a variance:</p>
                  <p>A. the deputy registrar's written statement of reasons why credit card and debit card acceptance would impose serious economic hardship;</p>

The commissioner shall give the deputy registrar written justification for a decision to deny the variance.

The commissioner shall then forward to the appropriate medical review board all information submitted by the applicant together with the commissioner's records relating to the matter. Each physician on the review board shall review the file and make a recommendation to the chair of the review board, who shall communicate the recommendation of the board, whether unanimous or divided, to the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>Upon receipt of the recommendation of the review board, the commissioner shall reconsider the application, take whatever action the commissioner then deems appropriate, and inform the driver or the applicant of the decision and of the reasons for the decision.

                <p>A. The road test in a commercial motor vehicle for a commercial driver's license must include a pretrip vehicle inspection, a demonstration of basic vehicle control skills, and a demonstration of street driving skills.</p>
                <p>B. The type of pretrip vehicle inspection depends on the vehicle used for the road test.</p>
                <p>(1) An applicant testing in a class A or B vehicle that is not a school bus must pass a pretrip knowledge test.</p>
                <p>(2) A pretrip vehicle inspection is not required for an applicant testing in a class C motor vehicle that is not a school bus; however, the commissioner shall conduct a vehicle inspection to determine if the test vehicle meets the safety standards in part 7410.5140, 7410.5160, 7410.5180, or 7410.5200, as applicable.</p>
                <p>(3) An applicant for a school bus endorsement must pass a complete walk-around vehicle inspection of the school bus during which the operation of all warning, safety, and major mechanical systems must be accurately demonstrated.</p>
                <p>(4) If the test vehicle is equipped with air brakes, the pretrip vehicle inspection described in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, section 383.113, must be passed.</p>
                <p>C. The basic vehicle control skills portion of the commercial driver's license road test must include a forward stop for accuracy, straight-line backing up, and a loading dock maneuver that tests the driver's ability to execute a sight-side backup and to turn the vehicle.</p>
                <p>D. The street driving skills portions of the commercial driver's license road test must include a demonstration of the same skills required for class D testing specified in subpart 2. Additionally, the applicant must demonstrate visual search and speed and space management techniques necessary for the safe operation of large and heavy commercial motor vehicles.</p>

                <p>(1) contain the individual's full name, address, date of birth, the driver's license number of any driver's license issued in any other state or specify any state in which a driver's license was issued, and the date of expiration of any license or endorsement on a license;</p>

                <p>(6) be signed and dated by the individual requesting a test waiver.</p>
                <p>C. The commissioner shall grant the variance request for a test waiver if:</p>

The commissioner shall notify the individual requesting a test waiver variance in writing of the commissioner's decision to grant or deny the variance within 60 days of receipt of the request.

                  <p>Each school bus driver is required to take and pass a physical examination every two years in order to retain the school bus driver's endorsement.

A school bus driver must submit the original or photographic copy of the completed physical examination form or medical examiner's certificate and the processing fee to the commissioner. The processing fee established in Minnesota Statutes, section 171.06, subdivision 2, paragraph (d), must be submitted at the time of application or renewal. Failure to pass the physical examination and submit the physical examination form or medical examiner's certificate will result in cancellation of the school bus driver's endorsement from the commercial driver's license and the CDL holder will be subject to part 7421.0800.</p>

                <p>A school patrol member must comply with the following procedures at street intersections and crossings:</p>
                <p>A. The patrol member shall stand on the road shoulder or curb (not in the roadway) where traffic shall be observed approaching from all directions.</p>
                <p>B. The patrol member shall instruct the children to remain in place until a break or lull in traffic is seen. During this time, except when actually issuing directions to the children, the patrol member shall stand erect and at attention with the flag staff resting on the ground in a vertical position to the right of the right foot. In this latter position the patrol member will more readily be observed by drivers of approaching vehicles.</p>
                <p>C. When a lull occurs in traffic the flag shall be raised vertically upward over the patrol member's head for a period of four seconds, to alert any oncoming traffic.</p>
                <p>D. When the lanes of the roadway are clear of traffic the patrol member shall extend the flag into the traffic lane at an angle of approximately 45 degrees upward. This will be the signal for all the children to start crossing the street. Holding the flag at a 45-degree angle will place it above the heads of the children. With two patrol members at one intersection, each member shall make a quarter turn in the direction of the oncoming traffic and remain as close as practicable to the curb or shoulder.</p>
                <p>E. While children are crossing the street in a column, the patrol member shall keep this position while watching or facing approaching traffic.</p>
                <p>F. After the children have completed crossing the street, the patrol member shall return to the original position on the shoulder or curb.</p>
                <p>G. Under no circumstances shall the flag ever be waved or misused in any manner.</p>
                <p>H. There shall be one or more patrol members at each crossing. When two are used, one patrol member shall operate as the sender on the side from which the children gather, and the other shall take a similar position on the opposite side of the roadway and operate as the receiver.</p>
                <p>I. At least two patrol members shall be used at a particular crossing when, in the opinion of local law enforcement officials, traffic or other conditions are such that more than one patrol member is needed for the safety of the school children.</p>
                <p>J. Patrol members shall continually watch oncoming traffic while children are crossing the roadway and be constantly alert for danger. They shall stand between the children and approaching traffic and remain as close as practicable to the curb or shoulder.</p>

                  <p>B. If a train is approaching the crossing, the patrol member shall not cross the tracks but shall face the bus at a safe distance from the tracks and give the signal for the bus not to proceed by holding up both hands above the head.</p>
                  <p>C. When the railroad track is clear and safe for crossing, the patrol member shall cross the tracks and signal, with a forward motion of an upraised arm, for the driver to proceed across the tracks to a point at least 2-1/2 bus lengths beyond the tracks, where the patrol member shall reenter the bus.</p>

                  <p>B. In directing pupils across the roadway after alighting from the bus, the patrol member shall escort the pupils to a position at least ten feet in front of the bus. When it is ascertained that there is no approaching traffic, the patrol member shall step out one pace beyond the fender line of the bus and extend the flag into the opposite lane at a 45-degree angle and direct the pupils to proceed across the roadway.</p>
                  <p>C. The patrol member shall not escort each pupil across the roadway, but shall remain at the designated post near the front of the bus.</p>
                  <p>D. Crossing the roadway behind the bus shall never be permitted.</p>

                  <p>The statewide common emergency frequency shall be used primarily for emergency communications between police agencies only. For purposes of this part, the term "emergency" means a set of circumstances resulting from natural disaster, accident, civil disorder, national emergency, and criminal activity that requires coordination and cooperation between various police agencies to protect lives and property. Routine interagency exchanges of information and communications regarding activity where life and property are not immediately endangered are not emergency communications for purposes of this part. The common emergency channel may be used on a secondary basis to provide communications to any itinerant police vehicle when the vehicle is beyond communication range of its base station and no other communication medium is readily available. This secondary use shall not cause harmful interference to the primary use of the channel.</p>

                <p>(a) Certification may be the specification listed in catalogs or publications by the manufacturer.</p>
                <p>(b) New construction of these securement devices and repairs to webbing must conform with standards established by the manufacturer of the webbing.</p>
                <p>(2) All-metal securement devices must be designed and constructed to provide wheelchair securement strength that is at least equal to the strength of a webbing-type device comprised of three separate attachments and anchorages.</p>
                <p>C. It must be free of sharp edges, corners, and jagged projections to minimize injury to persons in the event of unintentional contact.</p>
                <p>D. It must be capable of retraction, and be readily removable or otherwise suitably storable when not in use.</p>
                <p>E. It must be anchored to the vehicle at not less than two separate points with bolts, nuts, and lock washers or self-locking nuts.</p>
                <p>(1) Bolts used must be not less than 3/8-inch in diameter and of National Fine Thread SAE grade 5 designation or equivalent.</p>
                <p>(2) Where anchorage bolts do not pierce the vehicle frame, subframe, body post, or equivalent metal structure, a metal reinforcement plate or washer 1/16-inch thick and not less than four square inches or 2-1/4 inches in diameter respectively, is required.</p>
                <p>(3) Interior paneling may not be used to constitute anchorage for a point of securement.</p>
                <p>(4) A metal track, rail, or similar device permitting attachment of the securement device at optional points on it may be used to anchor the securement device, only if:</p>
                <p>(a) the track, rail, or other device is secured to the vehicle in compliance with anchorage requirements of this part; and</p>
                <p>(b) the attachment of the securement device to the anchor point is by means of a positive attachment metal fitting.</p>
                <p>F. The method or device that provides attachment of the securement device to the wheelchair frame and the method or device locking the securement device in the load-holding mode must each be of a strength and design that will ensure performance of their intended function until the securement device is intentionally released.</p>
                <p>G. Buckles, anchorage fittings, and other components essential to the functioning of the securement device must be integrated into the securement device in accordance with recognized practices and in a manner that preserves the overall strength of the securement device.</p>

The commissioner may load the wheelchair to 140 pounds and require that the vehicle be accelerated, driven around corners, and subjected to hard braking at speeds of 30 miles per hour or less. Movement of the wheelchair more than one inch in any direction, including vertically, during the test is grounds for refusing approval. Measurement of movement must be at the points where wheelchair wheels contact the floor. Damage to the wheelchair or other property or injury to a person during the test is the responsibility of the applicant.</p>

                <p>B. When vehicles used in escort operations are in front of the overdimensional vehicle or load being escorted, the operator shall:</p>
                <p>(1) warn oncoming traffic of the presence of the vehicle or load by use of lights and signs as provided within this chapter;</p>
                <p>(2) notify the driver of the overdimensional vehicle or load by two-way radio of all hazards; overhead clearances; obstructions; traffic congestion; pedestrians; and any other circumstances evident to the operator that could affect either the safe movement of the overdimensional vehicle or load, the safety of the traveling public, or the efficient movement of traffic in sufficient time for the driver of the overdimensional vehicle or load to take remedial action, as necessary;</p>
                <p>(3) to the extent necessary, locate safe places, if available, adjacent to the highway and notify the driver of the overdimensional vehicle or load thereof to allow the overdimensional vehicle or load and the pilot/escort vehicles to clear the highway, so that following traffic can safely pass or for any other reason necessary to protect public safety and the efficient movement of traffic; and</p>
                <p>(4) be far enough in front of the overdimensional vehicle or load to signal oncoming motorists to stop in a timely manner, before the motorists enter any narrow structures or other restrictions on the highway to permit the safe passage of the vehicle or load.</p>

                <p>(1) warn traffic approaching from the rear of the presence of the overdimensional vehicle or load ahead, by use of lights and signs as provided within this chapter;</p>
                <p>(2) notify the driver of the overdimensional vehicle or load by two-way radio of flat tires or other problems with the overdimensional vehicle or load; objects coming loose from the overdimensional vehicle or load; other traffic approaching or passing the overdimensional vehicle or load; and any other circumstances evident to the operator that could affect either the safe movement of the overdimensional vehicle or load, the safety of the traveling public, or the efficient movement of traffic in sufficient time for the driver of the overdimensional vehicle or load to take remedial action, as necessary;</p>
                <p>(3) notify the front pilot/escort driver and the driver of the overdimensional vehicle or load by two-way radio of traffic buildup and other delays to the normal flow and efficient movement of traffic caused by the movement of the overdimensional vehicle or load;</p>
                <p>(4) notify the driver of the vehicle or load by two-way radio of other vehicles attempting to pass the overdimensional vehicle or load; and</p>
                <p>(5) ensure the pilot/escort vehicle is far enough behind the overdimensional vehicle or load to signal motorists following the overdimensional vehicle or load to slow or stop in a timely manner, before narrow structures or other restrictions on the highway, to permit the safe passage of the overdimensional vehicle or load.</p>
                <p>D. Traffic lights procedure.</p>
                <p>(1) If the front pilot/escort vehicle goes through a traffic light but the overdimensional vehicle or load does not, then the driver of the front pilot/escort vehicle shall pull the vehicle over to the right side of the highway, where practicable, to wait for the overdimensional vehicle or load.</p>
                <p>(2) If the overdimensional vehicle or load goes through the traffic light but the rear pilot/escort vehicle does not, then the overdimensional vehicle or load must reduce speed until the pilot/escort resumes position behind the load.</p>
                <p>(3) Pilot/escort drivers are responsible for all requirements utilizing pilot escorts as directed in this chapter.</p>

                  <p>The sensitivity of a blasting agent must be determined by using a number 8 test blasting cap at regular intervals and after every change in formulation, or as requested by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>Ammonium nitrate of small particle size, such as crushed prills or fines, may be more sensitive and hazardous than ordinary prills and must be handled with greater care.</p>
                  <p>Liquid fuel with a flash point lower than that of number 2 diesel fuel oil, 125 degrees Fahrenheit minimum or legal, must not be used.</p>
                  <p>Crude oil and crankcase oil must not be used because they may contain light ends that offer increased vapor explosion hazards or gritty particles that tend to sensitize the resulting blasting agent.</p>
                  <p>If solid fuels are used, they must be chosen so as to minimize dust-explosion hazard.</p>
                  <p>Metal dusts, such as aluminum powder; peroxides; or chlorates must not be used unless the operations are conducted in a manner approved by the commissioner.</p>

                <p>Screening devices used pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 169A.41, must meet the following minimum standards and specifications:</p>
                <p>A. Accuracy of the screening device must remain consistent during a storage life of one year from the date of purchase, at storage temperatures ranging between minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
                <p>B. The reading of a screening device after a sample of breath is properly taken must be ascertainable under reduced levels of illumination.</p>
                <p>C. Operation of the screening device must be simple enough that operators can be trained to use the screening device with four hours or less of formal instruction.</p>
                <p>D. Each individual screening device must be packaged with a complete set of instructions as to how the device is to be properly calibrated and used for taking and analyzing a sample of breath.</p>
                <p>E. When a sample of breath is properly taken from an alcohol-free individual, the screening device must not indicate that alcohol is present.</p>
                <p>F. When a sample of breath is properly taken from an individual with an actual alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, the screening device must not have a deviation greater than plus or minus 0.015 alcohol concentration.</p>
                <p>G. A screening device intended to perform more than one test and requiring periodic calibration must, once calibrated, retain its calibration within plus or minus 0.010 alcohol concentration for a minimum of 14 days.</p>
                <p>H. A screening device that is disposable after a single use, and of which the accuracy is affected by storage, must be labeled with an expiration date.</p>

                  <p>Applications for review by the chemical abuse review panel are governed by the following procedures:</p>
                  <p>A. A request for review by the chemical abuse review panel must be submitted to the commissioner in writing together with copies of the written materials the person wishes to have considered. This request may include a written request for copies of the materials submitted to the panel by the commissioner. No personal appearance will be granted before the chemical abuse review panel.</p>
                  <p>B. The commissioner shall submit the person's requests and materials to the chemical abuse review panel not more than 30 days from receipt of the request for review.</p>
                  <p>C. The commissioner may submit written materials for consideration by the chemical abuse review panel. These materials will be supplied to the applicant if requested.</p>
                  <p>D. Both parties have the right to submit additional written material for rebuttal until the review date.</p>
                  <p>E. On the review date, the written material submitted by both parties will be sent to the chemical abuse review panel.</p>
                  <p>F. After receiving the written materials, the chemical abuse review panel shall recommend an alternative form of chemical dependency treatment to the commissioner if the person establishes that the type of treatment or diagnosis is not appropriate or correct under the individual circumstances of that person's case. The chemical abuse review panel shall recommend to the commissioner that the type of treatment be changed only if the person establishes that the type of treatment or diagnosis is appropriate or correct under the individual circumstances of that person's case.</p>
                  <p>G. The chemical abuse review panel shall report its recommendations to the commissioner within 15 days of submission of the written materials by the commissioner.</p>

                  <p>A contractor license, managing employee certificate, journeyman certificate, or apprentice registration is not valid during a suspension. A person may not perform fire protection-related work during a suspension. When a license, certificate, or registration is suspended, the person holding the license, certificate, or registration shall immediately surrender it. After a suspension period ends, the commissioner shall return the license, certificate, or registration. A suspension period ends after the last day of the period regardless of whether this day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The suspension period is as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. The suspension period is seven days, if there are no suspensions on the person's record within the past five years. This suspension period may be shortened if there are mitigating circumstances that indicate a shorter suspension period is appropriate. The suspension period must be at least three days.</p>
                  <p>B. The suspension period is 14 days, if there is one suspension on the person's record within the past five years. This suspension period may be shortened if there are mitigating circumstances that indicate a shorter suspension period is appropriate. The suspension period must be at least seven days.</p>
                  <p>C. The suspension period is 28 days, if there are two suspensions on the person's record within the past five years. This suspension period may be shortened if there are mitigating circumstances that indicate a shorter suspension period is appropriate. The suspension period must be at least 14 days.</p>
                  <p>D. When a suspension period is shortened based on mitigating circumstances, the commissioner shall in writing identify the mitigating circumstances and give the reasons for shortening the suspension period.</p>
                  <p>E. The suspension of a contractor, in addition to being on the record of the suspended contractor, is also on the record of another contractor if an owner, officer, board member, or managing employee of the other contractor was an owner, officer, board member, or managing employee of the suspended contractor at the time of the acts leading to the suspension.</p>
                  <p>F. When a suspension is imposed for a continuing violation, the suspension must last until the suspension period determined under items A to E expires or until the violation is corrected, whichever is later.</p>

                <p>Emergency response teams and chemical assessment teams are authorized to secure for use during an emergency response any technical assistance or specialized equipment necessary to safely and properly respond to an incident. When the incident involves explosives, explosive devices, incendiary devices, or shock-sensitive explosive chemicals, the teams must first request assistance from a Minnesota Department of Public Safety-authorized bomb squad. The cost of this assistance and equipment will be considered an actual cost of the team's response, recoverable from the responsible party.</p>

                <p>(2) Any statement, design, device, or representation which relates to alcoholic content or which tends to create the impression that a wine is unfortified or has been fortified, or has intoxicating qualities, or contains distilled spirits (except for a reference to distilled spirits in a statement of composition where such statement is required by parts 7515.0700 to 7515.0780 to appear as part of the designation of the product).</p>
                <p>(3) Any statement of age or representation relative to age (including words or devices in any brand name or mark) except that:</p>

The plan must be developed after consultation with supervisory officials, classification specialists, and persons technically familiar with the character of the work. All classifications must be evaluated by use of a formal job evaluation system. Class titles established by the classification plan shall be used in all personnel and financial records of the Department of Public Safety and the local emergency management agency, as well as in all examination procedures.</p>

                  <p>In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, the governor, through the commissioner of public safety, shall formally adopt and make effective a comprehensive compensation plan including minimum and maximum salary rates as published in parts 7520.1000 and 7520.1100, and recommended intervening steps as published in the public safety merit system manual, as amended through May 29, 1982, for all classes of positions. The plan shall apply to all agencies covered by the merit system, except as otherwise negotiated for employees in a bargaining unit in agencies where there is an exclusive representative or in those instances where the requirements of part 7520.0650, subpart 2, item C have been satisfied. The plan shall include salary ranges for the various classes, with the salary of each class consistent with the duties and responsibilities outlined in the class specifications. Minimum, intervening, and maximum rates of pay for each class shall be established to provide for salary advancement without change of duty, in recognition of meritorious service. The advice and suggestions of appointing authorities, prevailing salary rates for similar and competing types of employment in business and government, and other relevant factors shall be taken into consideration in developing the ranges. Equitable compensation relationships must be established between female-dominated, male-dominated, and balanced classes of employees in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, sections 471.991 to 471.999. Classes must be evaluated in order to determine comparable work value and to establish equitable compensation relationships between classes of positions.</p>

                  <p>In agencies where there is no exclusive representative or collective bargaining agreement, negotiated adjustments in the rates of pay of incumbents of positions, in order to conform to a newly adopted or currently effective compensation plan, shall be in accordance with items A to H.</p>
                  <p>A. If the rate of pay of an employee is below the minimum of the range prescribed for the employee's classification on the merit system compensation plan the rate shall be adjusted to that minimum.</p>
                  <p>B. If the rate of pay of an employee is at or above the new minimum salary adopted for the employee's class, the employee may receive the general merit system adopted adjustment and, if a class was adjusted to a greater extent than the general adopted adjustment, the class may receive the additional adjustment as provided in part 7520.0620, subpart 3, if the additional adjustment does not place the class salary over the new maximum adopted salary for the class.</p>
                  <p>C. If an appointing authority has determined that the general merit system adopted adjustment is inappropriate for its employees, it may grant a different adjustment; however, it must file with the supervisor the new salary steps by class. The adjustments shall at least place employees at the minimum salary and not over the maximum salary for their class.</p>
                  <p>D. Employees at the maximum salary for their class may be granted salary adjustments over the maximum salary prescribed for their class, only if a merit system adjustment is adopted and only in the amount adopted for incumbents of that class.</p>
                  <p>E. If the rate of pay of an employee is higher than the maximum of the range prescribed for the employee's class the rate may remain the same as long as the employee retains the same classification.</p>
                  <p>F. If the rate of pay of an employee falls between the minimum and maximum of the salary range prescribed for the employee's class but does not correspond to any intervening steps in the range due to the adoption of a merit system general adjustment the rate may remain the same. In the case of subsequent merit increases the employee shall be placed on a step in the adopted salary range for the employee's class.</p>
                  <p>G. Employees at or above the maximum salary rate for their class may be granted a salary adjustment only in the amount adopted by the merit system for all employees whose positions are not covered by the terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement. If an appointing authority wishes to grant a larger general adjustment to its employees than that adopted by the merit system, the appointing authority, by prior resolution, may grant that employee the annual equivalent of the difference between the merit system adopted adjustment for all employees and the agency adopted adjustment for its employees in the form of a single lump sum payment or lump sum salary payments commencing on the effective date of the general adjustment. The employee's base salary rate shall be equal to the employee's salary before the agency adjustment plus the merit system adopted adjustment.</p>
                  <p>H. An appointing authority may grant a salary increase within the salary range to an employee based upon unusual employment conditions that make the action necessary and the interests of the agency that will be served by the action. In granting this increase, the appointing authority shall give due consideration to the salary rates paid other employees in the same class in the agency and shall deny any request which does not assure equitable compensation for comparable work. Salary increases proposed according to this part are not based on employee performance or a general merit system adopted salary adjustment. The granting of the increase will not affect the employee's eligibility for subsequent merit increases or salary adjustments in accordance with merit system rules. If the unusual employment conditions justifying the increase are of a temporary nature the employee's salary shall be decreased to its previous level upon conclusion of those conditions, notwithstanding the provisions of part 7520.0670 or 9575.1180.</p>

If the general adjustments result in the reduction of the differential between employees in the same class of positions or between employees in different classes of positions in the same occupational field, adjustments may be made that will, insofar as practicable, maintain differentials within the limits of the new plan. In maintaining differentials the appointing authority shall consider the length of service and quality of performance of the employee affected.</p>

The applicant shall remit the estimated amount to the director within ten days of receipt of the notice. If the applicant does not remit the amount within this time, the director shall discontinue the investigation until the applicant remits the amount. The commissioner shall not issue a license to an applicant who fails to remit an investigation fee required under this subpart. Upon completion of the investigation, the director shall promptly refund to the applicant any amount by which the investigation fees submitted by the applicant exceed the actual costs of the investigation. A person who applies for a manufacturer license and a distributor license at the same time must submit only one investigation fee.</p>

                  <p>A. A service provider shall provide accurate data to the 911 automatic location identification database with no more than 0.5 percent of all calls received by the 911 network during any calendar year resulting in a no record found (NRF) condition.</p>
                  <p>(1) If a service provider provides service in areas covered by different 911 service providers, the standard must be applied to each 911 service provider's network separately.</p>
                  <p>(2) Adjustments to the number of NRF 911 calls attributed to a service provider during a calendar year must be made:</p>
                  <p>(a) for multiple 911 calls received from the same telephone number over a 24-hour period;</p>
                  <p>(b) for 911 calls received from a telephone installed less than two full business days, which includes each weekday except a legal holiday, following the date of installation;</p>
                  <p>(c) for prearranged test calls made to verify the operation of the 911 network;</p>
                  <p>(d) for manual searches on telephone numbers not received as 911 calls;</p>
                  <p>(e) for 911 calls received from a location that was referred to the PSAP jurisdiction for addressing while the addressing request is unresolved;</p>
                  <p>(f) if a telephone number generating the NRF call has been transferred to another service provider or entity, based upon reference to the Number Portability Administration Center, in which case the incident must be reassigned and reported as a NRF call to the appropriate service provider; and</p>
                  <p>(g) for one unadjusted NRF 911 call per 911 service provider where the service provider has less than 400 total 911 calls per 911 service provider during the measured calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(3) A service provider shall submit a written claim for any adjustments to the commissioner within 30 days of the incident.</p>
                  <p>B. Every 911 service provider:</p>
                  <p>(1) shall maintain a written procedure defining the 911 service provider's procedure for identifying, reporting, and resolving incidents of NRF, which provides for the timely reporting of each incident and the details of the incident, including the trunk group and trunk the call was received upon if available, to the responsible service provider;</p>
                  <p>(2) shall report the following information to the commissioner for each service provider within 30 days of the end of each calendar year:</p>
                  <p>(a) total number of 911 calls;</p>

                  <p>ii. brief description of the action taken to prevent a reoccurrence, if known to the 911 service provider; and</p>
                  <p>iii. the basis for any adjustment requested by the service provider, if known to the 911 service provider; and</p>
                  <p>(3) who provides reports monthly to the commissioner throughout the calendar year, is not required to submit a year-end report.</p>
                  <p>C. Every public safety answering point shall adopt a procedure for handling NRF 911 calls, which must include:</p>
                  <p>(1) a description of the causes for a NRF 911 call from service providers using different technologies, including but not limited to wire line, wireless, and VOIP;</p>
                  <p>(2) recognition of a NRF 911 call by PSAP personnel;</p>
                  <p>(3) any attributes of the 911 calls display that might aid in identifying the location of the caller;</p>
