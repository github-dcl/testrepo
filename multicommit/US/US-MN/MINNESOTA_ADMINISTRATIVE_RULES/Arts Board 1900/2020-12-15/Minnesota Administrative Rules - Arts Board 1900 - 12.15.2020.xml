                <p>The purpose of parts 1900.2310 to 1900.4110 is to set forth procedures and criteria to be followed by the board and designated regional arts councils to conduct a decentralized system of providing grants and other forms of assistance at the grass roots level.

                <p>A. The detailed program-specific criteria, and the weight given to each, are described in parts 1900.2110 to 1900.2260. Advisory panels shall review applications to make recommendations for grants and other forms of assistance according to the merit and artistic quality as demonstrated by the applicant's artistic work sample or equivalent, such as a site visit of the proposed activity, in order to make recommendations to the board. In the case of service programs and projects, the merit and quality of the service being provided to the arts shall be reviewed.</p>
                <p>B. The advisory panel shall thoroughly review all submitted application materials, and score the applications based upon the degree to which the applicant has satisfied the program-specific review criteria. Partial funding may be awarded if the panel finds that an application includes activities or costs that are not allowed in the program from which funding is requested. The panel shall score based solely on the contents of the application and any required supporting materials, including work samples or equivalent, and shall not consider outside information.</p>
                <p>C. All panel meetings shall be held at the Arts Board office, unless otherwise announced in advance. All panel meetings shall be open to the public. Dates and locations shall be posted on the Arts Board's website. Applicants shall be encouraged to attend but may not make presentations to the panels, staff, or board.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of a juried listing is to provide a centralized source of written information about a specific group of artists. Based on a board review, artists who are included shall have been judged to be qualified to represent their art form or expertise to the public. The board is not an agent of any artist or group.</p>
                  <p>A. The Minnesota folk artists directory is intended to provide a list of high-quality folk artists and groups interested in public performance opportunities to be distributed to arts programmers and others throughout the Upper Midwest, and to be used as a reference by state and local organizations interested in presenting the folk arts.</p>
                  <p>B. The arts in education roster of artists shall provide a list of artists who specialize in school and community residency work, offering a balanced range of arts disciplines, teaching styles, and residency approaches to schools interested in offering artist residencies.</p>
                  <p>C. The Arts Across Minnesota touring directory is a list of nonprofit performing and visual arts organizations in Minnesota that offer public performances, exhibitions, and community residency programming. The directory is intended to serve as a reliable source of high-quality touring organizations and as a reference for Arts Across Minnesota host community applicants.</p>

                  <p>The program may purchase or commission original works of art with up to one percent of the total construction budget of a state building with a construction or renovation budget of at least $500,000. This program shall enable artists to participate with client agencies and design professionals in the process of designing public spaces within and around state buildings; shall commission artists to create artworks to be integrated into the buildings and sites; or shall purchase existing artworks to be displayed throughout the buildings. In addition, the program shall manage and maintain an artist registry as a resource for selecting visual artists and artwork when new sites are identified for the program. The registry shall also be used by other nonstate organizations or individuals interested in locating artwork for commission or purchase. With authorization from the Department of Administration, the board may use up to ten percent of each site's percent for art in public places' appropriation for administrative costs.</p>

                  <p>The four criteria used when reviewing artwork for purchase, or artists to commission, shall be in the two perspectives as described in items A and B.</p>
                  <p>A. Artistic quality, design, and permanence are the three primary criteria and equally important. Site selection committee members will examine slides of artists' previous work, and a professional resume when considering and assessing the artwork or artists.</p>
                  <p>(1) Artistic quality shall be demonstrated by:</p>
                  <p>(a) work samples;</p>
                  <p>(b) adequate experience in production of public art; and</p>
                  <p>(c) evidence of ability to work within budget.</p>
                  <p>(2) Design shall be demonstrated by:</p>
                  <p>(a) aesthetic compatibility with the architecture; and</p>
                  <p>(b) appropriate medium, given the function and use of the site.</p>
                  <p>(3) Permanence shall be demonstrated by:</p>
                  <p>(a) use of durable materials; and</p>
                  <p>(b) good construction techniques.</p>
                  <p>B. The secondary criterion in order of importance shall be the acquisition of a variety of artwork appropriate to a public collection, which is demonstrated by:</p>
                  <p>(1) artwork in different mediums and styles, and with a breadth of themes or subjects;</p>
                  <p>(2) artwork which recognizes and fosters diverse social, cultural, and historical values; and</p>
                  <p>(3) artwork which is memorable, thought-provoking, and enduring.</p>

                  <p>A. members must have familiarity with public art issues and acquisition procedures or experience with community-based visual arts projects;</p>
                  <p>B. two members (or three, if it is a seven person committee) shall represent the residents and users of the building, appointed by the custodial agency that has authority over the appropriation that includes funds for the project;</p>
                  <p>C. one member shall represent the architect for the building;</p>
                  <p>D. two members (or three, if it is a seven person committee) who have expertise as an artist, curator, critic, writer, museum director, arts educator or administrator, member of the Arts Board, architect, landscape architect, or other design professional shall be appointed by the board; and</p>

                  <p>A. One of the two methods in subitems (1) and (2) is used by the site selection committee to acquire works of art:</p>
                  <p>(1) purchase of existing work; or</p>
                  <p>(2) commission of new work especially for the site.</p>
                  <p>When new work is commissioned, the artist first presents a design proposal, including a budget and timeline, that must be reviewed and approved by the site selection committee.</p>
                  <p>B. The site selection committee may use a combination of competition types to assemble a pool of applicants for awards.</p>
                  <p>(1) Open competitions shall be announced by the distribution of a request for qualifications or a request for proposals describing the project. Work samples from all eligible responsive applicants shall be shown to the site selection committee. This type of competition is most suitable for projects with large budgets and extended timelines.</p>
                  <p>(2) Registry competitions shall use the artist registry to prescreen applicants who meet the specific criteria identified for the site by the site selection committee. The registry shall be used for all projects, often in combination with other types of competitions, but is particularly suitable for projects with limited budgets, short timelines, and if work is sought for a purchase award.</p>
                  <p>(3) Invitational competitions shall use a list of artists developed by the board for the purpose of sending an invitation to apply for a specific site award. This type of competition is most suitable when artists are sought who have particular skills or abilities, or who work in specific mediums appropriate to the project, or for projects with an extended timeline.</p>
                  <p>(4) For direct competitions, the site selection committee shall directly invite a limited list of artists developed by the board to apply, or the committee shall visit galleries, museums, or studios to select artwork. This type of competition is most suitable for projects with limited budgets, short timelines, or where work is sought for direct purchase.</p>
                  <p>The site selection committee's recommendations shall be given to the board, the Department of Administration, and other necessary state agencies for final approval. Upon approval, the board shall enter into a contract with the artist. The contract shall provide for the direct purchase of existing work or one or both of the following: the production of schematic design proposals for a commissioned work or the actual production of commissioned work.</p>

                  <p>A. At the beginning of a fiscal year, if negotiations for the Regional Arts Council/Minnesota State Arts Board Fiscal Agent Agreement are still in process, the board must institute a system of partial allocation payments to each council until the agreement is completed. The payments may be contingent upon the submission of reports or receipt of information requested by the board. The Regional Arts Council Forum and each of the 11 regional arts councils must be notified by the board in writing by May 31 prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, of the board's intent to make partial payments, the conditions for the board making payments, and the conditions for the board's discontinuing the contingent payment system. If a contingent payment system is instituted by the board, it must be done in a manner which ensures that the normal operations of the councils are not impeded.</p>
                  <p>B. When a region is not served by a regional arts council, the regional arts council block allocation for regions not served by a council shall be administered by the board with the advice of the regional arts advisory committee until a new council is designated, but in no case for longer than six months. If a region is without a council for longer than six months, the Regional Arts Council Forum may direct the board to redistribute the region's unexpended and unobligated regional arts council block allocation for the current fiscal year to the remaining councils in a formula to be determined by the Regional Arts Council Forum.</p>

                  <p>There can only be one regional arts council in each region. A council shall remain the regional arts council until its designation is officially removed. The following circumstances shall result in the removal of designation:</p>
                  <p>A. At any time, a council may determine that it is not in its organization's or its region's best interest for it to continue as the regional arts council. The council must notify the board of its intent to cease operation as a council and work cooperatively with the board to provide for an orderly transition when a new organization receives the regional arts council designation.</p>
                  <p>B. The Regional Arts Council/Minnesota State Arts Board Fiscal Agent Agreement shall define the terms for a council's receipt of its block allocation. It shall also define the process of notification which the board must follow if it believes that a council is out of compliance with the agreement and the process which must be followed to remedy concerns or to rescind a council's designation. If the council successfully remedies concerns, it shall remain the regional arts council. If it does not successfully remedy, the board shall remove the council as the regional arts council.</p>
                  <p>C. Removal of designation initiated by the board due to an unsuccessful probationary period, as described in part 1900.3210, subpart 7.</p>
                  <p>D. If, after following part 1900.3210, a competing organization is awarded the designation by the board, the challenged council must receive written notification that its designation has been removed by a vote of the board. This notification must contain a timeline for transfer of all appropriate records, a description of the closure process to be followed, and a request for return or transfer of all unexpended legislative funds.</p>
