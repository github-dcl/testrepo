                  <p>The provision of emergency service is governed by items A to E.</p>
                  <p>A. The staffing for an emergency veterinary facility must include a licensed veterinarian on the premises at all times during the posted hours of operation.</p>
                  <p>B. Advertisements for emergency veterinary facilities must clearly state:</p>
                  <p>(1) the hours the facility will provide emergency service;</p>
                  <p>(2) a licensed veterinarian is on the premises during the posted emergency hours; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the address and telephone number of the facility.</p>
                  <p>C. "Veterinarian on call" means a veterinarian is not present at a veterinary facility, but is able to respond within a reasonable time to requests for emergency veterinary services. The facility's services are not to be considered or advertised as an emergency clinic or hospital.</p>
                  <p>D. If continuing care of the patient is required following emergency service, the animal owner or caretaker must be provided with a legible copy of the medical record to be transferred to the next attending veterinarian, or a copy must be transmitted directly to the attending veterinarian. The information included in the medical record must consist of at least the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) physical examination findings;</p>
                  <p>(2) dosages and time of administration of medications;</p>
                  <p>(3) copies of diagnostic data or procedures;</p>
                  <p>(4) all radiographs, for which the facility must obtain a signed release when transferred;</p>

                  <p>Mobile veterinary practice is governed by items A to E.</p>
                  <p>A. Mobile veterinary practice is that form of clinical veterinary practice that may be transported or moved from one location to another for delivery of service. Mobile veterinary practice may be general service, limited service, or outcall service. For purposes of this item:</p>
                  <p>(1) "general mobile veterinary practice" means providing a wide range of medical or surgical services in a movable trailer or mobile home type of vehicle modified to function as, and comparably equipped to, a fixed veterinary practice facility;</p>
                  <p>(2) "limited service mobile veterinary practices" means practices restricted to the delivery of animal health protection through vaccination or minor diagnostic testing and treatment; and</p>
                  <p>(3) "outcall service" is a mobile extension of a fixed location general service veterinary practice, located within the same practice area, but physically removed from the practice premises. Depending on the types of animals being treated, an outcall service provides vaccinations, physical examinations, treatments, diagnostic screenings, and surgery.</p>
                  <p>B. Mobile veterinary practices that are not extensions of a fixed veterinary facility must have an affiliation with a general service veterinary facility in the same region for the provisions of long-term hospitalization, surgery, or radiology if not available in the mobile unit. Clients must be informed, in writing, of this affiliation.</p>
                  <p>C. In all types of mobile veterinary practice, patient care must be consistent with prevailing standards of practice and a veterinarian-client-patient relationship must exist.</p>
                  <p>D. Mobile units must be maintained in a clean and sanitary fashion. Vehicles must contain equipment necessary for the veterinarian to perform physical examinations, surgical procedures, and medical treatments consistent with the type of veterinary services being rendered and the standards of practice for those services.</p>
                  <p>E. Representatives of the board, upon receipt of written complaint, may inspect mobile veterinary units for sanitation and cleanliness and may direct action to ensure adequate sanitation and cleanliness.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">7</inline>. <b>Supervision.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Supervision is governed by items A to C.</p>
                  <p>A. A licensed veterinarian is professionally and legally responsible for any practice of veterinary medicine by the veterinarian's unlicensed employees. An employee's practice of veterinary medicine without a license constitutes grounds for the board to take action against the licensed veterinarian and the unlicensed individual. A veterinarian must have examined the animal patient prior to the delegation of an animal health care task to a nonlicensed employee. The examination must be conducted at a time consistent with prevailing standards of practice relative to the delegated animal health care task.</p>
                  <p>B. A veterinarian shall not authorize a nonlicensed employee to perform the following functions:</p>
                  <p>(1) surgery;</p>
                  <p>(2) diagnosis and prognosis; and</p>
                  <p>(3) prescribing of drugs, medicines, and appliances.</p>
                  <p>C. A veterinarian shall ensure that the activities of a supervised individual are within the scope of the orders, assignment, or prescriptions of the veterinarian and within the capabilities of the individual. Supervision by a veterinarian must involve the degree of close physical proximity necessary for the supervising veterinarian to observe and monitor the performance of a supervised individual. The supervising veterinarian must be on the client's premises or present in the veterinary facility while the supervised individual is performing health care services. This does not prohibit the performance of generalized nursing tasks, ordered by the attending veterinarian, to be performed by an unlicensed employee on inpatient animals during the hours when a veterinarian is not routinely on the premises. Nor does it prohibit, under emergency conditions, wherein an animal is placed in a life-threatening condition and requires immediate treatment to sustain life or prevent further injury, an unlicensed employee from rendering lifesaving aid and treatment to an animal in the absence of a veterinarian.</p>

                  <p>A. A veterinarian may claim to be a specialist only if the veterinarian is certified as a specialist in a discipline for which there is a specialty board approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). A veterinarian may not use the term "specialist" for an area of practice for which there is no AVMA-recognized certification. A diplomate of the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners can claim only a specialty for the class of animals in which the diplomate specializes.</p>
                  <p>B. "Specialty" or "specialists" may not be used in the name of a veterinary hospital unless all veterinary staff are board-certified specialists.</p>

Thereafter, each veterinarian possessing a license to practice veterinary medicine shall certify compliance at the time of each subsequent biennial license renewal. Licensees with odd-numbered licenses renewed in 1997 are required to have completed 20 credit hours and thereafter 40 credit hours for subsequent biennial license renewal periods.

                  <p>A. The board, at the time of license renewal, must furnish each licensee a form upon which the licensee must certify fulfillment of the required number of continuing education hours for the two-year period preceding the license renewal date or that they qualify for waiver of requirements as specified in items B to E.</p>
                  <p>B. Licensees are responsible for maintaining documentation of continuing education attendance for a minimum of four years. The board may, at its discretion, require licensees to furnish additional evidence as is necessary to verify compliance with board continuing education requirements. Upon board request, whether as part of a routine audit or as part of an individual complaint investigation, a licensee must furnish, within 30 days, proof to the board of satisfactorily meeting the required number of continuing education hours established by the board or of qualifying for a waiver.</p>
                  <p>(1) Proof in the form of attendance certificates, diplomas, canceled checks, or class rosters accompanied with a course program, or other documentation acceptable to the board must be submitted.</p>
                  <p>(2) The board is the final determining authority as to the acceptability of specific continuing education documentation or waiver qualification.</p>
                  <p>C. The following acts are unprofessional conduct and are subject to disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 156.081, subdivision 2, clause (11):</p>
                  <p>(1) failure to meet minimum continuing education credit hour requirements for biennial license renewal;</p>
                  <p>(2) failure to submit adequate proof of continuing education attendance within 30 days of a board request; and</p>
                  <p>(3) falsification of attendance documentation.</p>
                  <p>D. Excess continuing education credit hours may not be banked or carried forward into the next license renewal cycle.</p>
                  <p>E. For disciplinary purposes, the board may direct a licensee to take additional continuing education, in specific disciplines, over and above the general continuing education requirements for relicensure.</p>
