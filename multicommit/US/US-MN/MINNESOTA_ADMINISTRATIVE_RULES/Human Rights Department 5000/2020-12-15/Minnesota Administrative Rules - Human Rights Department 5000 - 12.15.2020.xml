                <p>When a person who has filed a verified charge as provided in part 5000.0400 indicates to the commissioner an intent to bring a private civil action in the matter pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.33, subdivision 3, the commissioner shall suspend processing of the charge and request the charging party to execute, within 30 days, either:</p>
                <p>A. a statement of withdrawal signed by the charging party or attorney of record declaring that a private action will be commenced within 90 days of the initial notice; or</p>
                <p>B. a request to resume processing the case to a disposition consistent with other provisions of the statute and parts 5000.0050 to 5000.2400.</p>
                <p>If neither is received within 30 days of delivery of the request to the charging party, the commissioner shall process the case as consistent with the provisions of the act and parts 5000.0050 to 5000.2400.</p>
                <p>A copy of a summons and complaint served upon the respondent, whether submitted to the commissioner by the charging party, the respondent, or obtained from the court administrator in which it was filed, shall be sufficient to permit the commissioner to terminate all proceedings in the department relating to the charge.</p>

                  <p>With the permission of the charging party, the commissioner may sue on behalf of a class only if: there are questions of law or fact common to the class, and the claims of members of the class are of sufficient similarity that a fair hearing of them is possible in a class action, and the commissioner will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, and one of the following three conditions exists:</p>
                  <p>A. the prosecution of separate actions by the commissioner on behalf of individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class, or adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; or</p>
                  <p>B. the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate relief that includes final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or</p>
                  <p>C. the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: the interest of members of the class in individually affecting the prosecution of separate actions; the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by members of the class; the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the administrative hearing; the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</p>

Notice shall be reasonably certain to inform those affected, or, where conditions do not reasonably permit the notice, the form of notice shall not be substantially less likely to give notice than other of the feasible and customary substitutes. If the complaint seeks compensatory relief, the notice shall advise each member that the member will be excluded from the class, with respect to monetary relief, if the member so requests by a specified date, and the decision, whether favorable or not, will include all members who do not request exclusion.</p>

                <p>If the commissioner has reason to believe that a state agency has awarded a contract in excess of $100,000 to a contractor who employs more than 40 full-time employees in Minnesota but did not hold a valid certificate of compliance at the time the contract was awarded, the commissioner must notify the agency and the contractor of this potential violation and of the commissioner's information and reason for believing that a violation has occurred, and request a written response from each within ten days. Each response should explain why the state agency or contractor believes the contract was in compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36, or explain why the contract should not be voided if not in compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36, and include an affirmative action plan in compliance with parts 5000.3400 to 5000.3600. The contracting state agency's response must also include a copy of the contract.</p>
                <p>If, after consideration of both responses, and other evidence available to the commissioner and previously shown to the contracting state agency and contractor, the commissioner determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the contract was legally awarded, the commissioner must notify the contracting state agency and the contractor within ten days that the contract will not be voided. If the commissioner determines that a preponderance of the evidence shows the contract was not legally awarded, the commissioner shall consider whether the benefit of voiding the contract outweighs the potential for adverse impact to the public interest. The commissioner shall void the contract if the potential for adverse impact is outweighed by the benefit to be obtained from voiding the contract. The commissioner must notify the contracting state agency and the contractor within ten days of the commissioner's decision.</p>
                <p>The commissioner's decision voiding any contract must be served upon the contracting state agency and contractor by certified mail. The commissioner's decision voiding a contract must be mailed simultaneously by regular mail to the commissioners of administration and management and budget, to the assistant attorney general representing the contracting state agency, and to any other parties to the contract. The contract is void after ten days from receipt of the commissioner's decision by the contracting state agency or the contractor, whichever is later.</p>
                <p>A contractor may apply for a certificate of compliance at any time.</p>

                  <p>Suggested techniques to improve recruitment and increase the flow of minority or female applicants are as follows in items A to J.</p>
                  <p>A. Certain organizations such as the Urban League, Job Corps, Equal Opportunity Programs, Inc., concentrated employment programs, Neighborhood Youth Corps, secondary schools, colleges, and city colleges with high minority enrollment, the state employment services, specialized employment agencies are normally prepared to refer minority applicants. Organizations prepared to refer women with specific skills are: National Organization for Women, welfare rights organizations, Women's Equity Action League, Talent Bank for Business and Professional Women (including 26 women's organizations), Professional Women's Caucus, Intercollegiate Association of University Women, black women's sororities and service groups such as Delta Sigma Theta, Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Zeta Phi Beta; National Council of Negro Women, American Association of University Women, YWCA, and sectarian groups such as Jewish women's groups, Catholic women's groups, Protestant women's groups, and women's colleges. In addition, community leaders as individuals shall be added to recruiting sources.</p>
                  <p>B. Formal briefing sessions shall be held, preferably on company premises, with representatives from these recruiting sources. Plant tours, presentations by minority and female employees, clear and concise explanations of current and future job openings, position descriptions, worker specifications, explanations of the company's selection process, and recruiting literature shall be an integral part of the briefings. Formal arrangements shall be made for referral of applicants, follow-up with sources, and feedback on disposition of applicants.</p>
                  <p>C. Minority and female employees, using procedures similar to item B, shall be actively encouraged to refer applicants.</p>
                  <p>D. A special effort shall be made to include minorities and women on the personnel relations staff.</p>
                  <p>E. Minority and female employees shall be made available for participation in career days, youth motivation programs, and related activities in their communities.</p>
                  <p>F. Active participation in "job fairs" is desirable. Company representatives participating shall be given authority to make on-the-spot commitments.</p>
                  <p>G. Active recruiting programs shall be carried out at secondary schools, junior colleges, and colleges with predominant minority or female enrollments.</p>
                  <p>H. Recruiting efforts at all schools shall be undertaken whenever possible. Some possible programs are:</p>
                  <p>(1) technical and nontechnical co-op programs at predominantly black and women's colleges;</p>
                  <p>(2) "after school" or work-study jobs for minority youths, female and male;</p>
                  <p>(3) summer jobs for underprivileged youth, female and male;</p>
                  <p>(4) summer work-study programs for female and male faculty members of the predominantly minority schools and colleges; and</p>
                  <p>(5) motivation, training, and employment programs for the hardcore unemployed, female and male.</p>
                  <p>I. When recruiting brochures pictorially present work situations, the minority and female members of the workforce must be included, especially when brochures are used in school and career programs.</p>
                  <p>J. Help wanted advertising shall be expanded to include the minority news media and women's interest media on a regular basis.</p>

                  <p>The contractor shall ensure that minority and female employees are given equal opportunity for promotion. Suggestions for achieving this result include:</p>
                  <p>A. Post or otherwise announce promotional opportunities.</p>
                  <p>B. Make an inventory of current minority and female employees to determine academic, skill, and experience level of individual employees.</p>
                  <p>C. Initiate necessary remedial, job training, and work-study programs.</p>
                  <p>D. Develop and implement formal employee evaluation programs.</p>
                  <p>E. Make certain "worker specifications" have been validated on job performance related criteria. Neither minority nor female employees shall be required to possess higher qualifications than those of the lowest qualified incumbent.</p>
                  <p>F. When apparently qualified minority or female employees are passed over for upgrading, require supervisory personnel to submit written justification.</p>
                  <p>G. Establish formal career counseling programs to include attitude development, education aid, job rotation, buddy system, and similar programs.</p>
                  <p>H. Review seniority practices and seniority clauses in union contracts to ensure the practices or clauses are nondiscriminatory and do not have a discriminatory effect.</p>
                  <p>I. Make certain facilities and company-sponsored social and recreation activities are desegregated. Actively encourage all employees to participate.</p>
                  <p>J. Encourage child care, housing, and transportation programs appropriately designed to improve the employment opportunities for minorities and women.</p>

                <p>The contractor's compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36 and part 5000.3520 shall be based on its implementation of the equal opportunity clause, specific affirmative action obligations required by the specifications in part 5000.3540, and its efforts to meet the goals established for the geographical area where the contract resulting from this solicitation is to be performed. The hours of minority and female employment and training must be substantially uniform throughout the length of the contract, and in each trade, and the contractor must make a good faith effort to employ minorities and women evenly on each of its projects. The transfer of minority or female employees or trainees from contractor to contractor or from project to project for the sole purpose of meeting the contractor's goals is a violation of the contract, Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36 and part 5000.3520. Compliance with the goals will be measured against the total work hours performed.</p>
                <p>3. The contractor must provide written notification to the Compliance Division of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights within ten working days of award of any construction subcontract at any tier for construction work under the contract resulting from the solicitation. The notification must list the name, address, and telephone number of the subcontractor; employer identification number, estimated dollar amount of the subcontract; estimated starting and completion dates of the subcontract; and the geographical area in which the contract is to be performed.</p>
                <p>4. As used in this notice, and in the contract resulting from this solicitation, the "covered area" is the geographical area where the contract is to be performed. The contracting state agency must insert the description of the geographical areas where the contract is to be performed describing the state, county, city, town, or municipality of the geographic area in the notice, and in the contract resulting from this solicitation."</p>

                <p><shortTitle>5000.<inline name="num">3535</inline> <b>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CLAUSE REQUIRED.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>Each contracting state agency and each contractor must include the following equal opportunity clause in each of its covered state and state-assisted construction contracts (and modifications, renewals, or extensions if not included in the original contract):</p>
                <p>"STANDARD STATE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY</p>
                <p>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS</p>
                <p>1. The contractor must implement the specific affirmative action standards provided in paragraphs 4(a) to (o) of these specifications. The goals set forth in the solicitation from which this contract resulted are expressed as percentages of the total hours of employment and training of minority and female utilization the contractor must reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area. The contractor must make substantially uniform progress toward its goals in each craft during the period specified.</p>
                <p>2. Neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with whom the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer either minorities or women shall excuse the contractor's obligations under these specifications, Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36 of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, or the rules adopted under the act.</p>
                <p>3. In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, such apprentices and trainees must be employed by the contractor during the training period, and the contractor must have made a commitment to employ the apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability of employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained according to training programs approved by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry, or the United States Department of Labor.</p>
                <p>4. The contractor must take specific affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunity. The evaluation of the contractor's compliance with these specifications must be based upon its effort to achieve maximum results from its actions. The contractor must document these efforts fully, and must implement affirmative action steps at least as extensive as the following:</p>
                <p>(a) Make a good faith effort to maintain a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, and coercion at all sites, and in all facilities at which the contractor's employees are assigned to work. The contractor must specifically ensure that all lead supervisors, superintendents, and other on-site supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the contractor's obligation to maintain such a working environment, with specific attention to minority or female persons working at such sites or in such facilities.</p>
                <p>(b) Establish and maintain a current list of minority and female recruitment sources, provide written notification to minority and female recruitment sources and to community organizations when the contractor or its unions have employment opportunities available, and maintain a record of the organizations' responses.</p>
                <p>(c) Maintain a current file of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street applicant and minority or female referral from a union, a recruitment source, or community organization and of what action was taken with respect to each person. If the person was sent to the union hiring hall for referral and was not referred back to the contractor by the union or, if referred, not employed by the contractor, this must be documented in the file with the reason therefore, along with whatever additional actions the contractor may have taken.</p>
                <p>(d) Provide immediate written notification to the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights when the union or unions with which the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not referred to the contractor a minority person or woman sent by the contractor, or when the contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the contractor's efforts to meet its obligations.</p>
                <p>(e) Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the areas which expressly include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to the contractor's employment needs, especially those programs funded or approved by the state of Minnesota. The contractor must provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under (b).</p>
                <p>(f) Disseminate the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy by providing notice of the policy to unions and training programs and requesting their cooperation in assisting the contractor in meeting its equal employment opportunity obligations; by including it in any policy manual and collective bargaining agreement; by publicizing it in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.; by specific review of the policy with all management personnel and with all minority and female employees at least once a year; and by posting the company equal employment opportunity policy on bulletin boards accessible to all employees at each location where construction work is performed.</p>
                <p>(g) Review, at least annually, the company's equal employment opportunity policy and affirmative action obligations under these specifications with all employees having any responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination, or other employment decisions including specific review of these items with on-site supervisory personnel such as superintendents, general lead supervisors, etc., prior to the first day of construction work at any job site. A written record must be made and maintained identifying the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed, and disposition of the subject matter.</p>
                <p>(h) Disseminate the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy externally by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically including minority and female news media, and providing written notification to and discussing the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy with other contractors and subcontractors with whom the contractor does or anticipates doing business.</p>
                <p>(i) Direct its recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority, female, and community organizations, to schools with minority and female students, and to minority and female recruitment and training organizations serving the contractor's recruitment area and employment needs. Not later than one month prior to the date for the acceptance of applications for apprenticeship or other training by any recruitment source the contractor must send written notification to organizations such as the above, describing the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be used in the selection process.</p>
                <p>(j) Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit other minority persons and women and, where reasonable, provide after school, summer, and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the site and in other areas of a contractor's work force.</p>
                <p>(k) Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female personnel for promotional opportunities and encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate training, such opportunities.</p>
                <p>(l) Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work assignments, and other personnel practices do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment related activities to ensure that the equal employment opportunity policy and the contractor's obligations under these specifications are being carried out.</p>
                <p>(m) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are nonsegregated except that separate or single-user toilet and necessary changing facilities shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes.</p>
                <p>(n) Document and maintain a record of all solicitations of offers for subcontracts from minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor associations and other business associations.</p>
                <p>(o) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' adherence to and performance under the contractor's equal employment opportunity policies and affirmative action obligations.</p>
                <p>5. Contractors are encouraged to participate in voluntary associations which assist in fulfilling one or more of their affirmative action obligations (4(a) to (o)). The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union, contractor-community, or other similar group of which the contractor is a member and participant, may be asserted as fulfilling any one or more of its obligations under 4(a) to (o) of these specifications provided that the contractor actively participates in the group, makes every effort to assure that the group has a positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry, ensures that the concrete benefits of the program are reflected in the contractor's minority and female workforce participation, makes a good faith effort to meet its individual goals and timetables, and can provide access to documentation which demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the contractor. The obligation to comply, however, is the contractor's and failure of such a group to fulfill an obligation must not be defense for the contractor's noncompliance.</p>
                <p>6. A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women have been established. The contractor, however, is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both female and male, and all women, both minority and nonminority. Consequently, the contractor may be in violation of part 5000.3520 if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner (for example, even though the contractor has achieved its goals for women generally, the contractor may be in violation of part 5000.3520 if a specific minority group is underutilized).</p>
                <p>7. The contractor must not use the goals and timetables or affirmative action standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, disability, sexual orientation, or age.</p>
                <p>8. The contractor must not enter into any subcontract with any person or firm debarred from government contracts under the federal Executive Order 11246 or a local human rights ordinance, or whose certificate of compliance has been suspended or revoked pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36.</p>
                <p>9. The contractor must carry out such sanctions for violation of these specifications and of the equal opportunity clause, including suspension, termination, and cancellation of existing contracts as may be imposed or ordered pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36, and its implementing rules. Any contractor who fails to carry out such sanctions will be in violation of these specifications and Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36.</p>
                <p>10. The contractor, in fulfilling its obligations under these specifications, must implement specific affirmative action steps, at least as extensive as those standards prescribed in paragraph 4, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the contractor fails to comply with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36, its implementing rules, or these specifications, the commissioner must proceed in accordance with part 5000.3570.</p>
                <p>11. The contractor must designate a responsible official to monitor all employment-related activity to ensure that the company equal employment opportunity policy is being carried out, to submit reports relating to the provisions hereof as may be required by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, and to keep records. Records must at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone numbers, construction trade, union affiliation if any, employee identification number when assigned, social security number, race, sex, status (for example, mechanic, apprentice trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records must be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy this requirement, contractors must not be required to maintain separate records.</p>
                <p>12. Nothing provided in this part will be construed as a limitation upon the application of other state or federal laws which establish different standards of compliance or upon the application of requirements for the hiring of local or other area residents."</p>

                <p>"AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR DISABLED WORKERS</p>
                <p>(a) The contractor must not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of physical or mental disability in regard to any position for which the employee or applicant for employment is qualified. The contractor agrees to take affirmative action to employ, advance in employment, and otherwise treat qualified disabled persons without discrimination based upon their physical or mental disability in all employment practices such as the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment, advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and selection for training, including apprenticeship.</p>

                <p>(d) The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices in a form to be prescribed by the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. Such notices must state the contractor's obligation under the law to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified disabled employees and applicants for employment, and the rights of applicants and employees.</p>

                  <p>Contractors must review their employment practices to determine whether their personnel programs provide the required affirmative action for employment and advancement of qualified disabled persons. Based upon the findings of such reviews, contractors must undertake appropriate outreach and positive recruitment activities, such as those listed in items A to J. It is not contemplated that contractors will necessarily undertake all the listed activities or that their activities will be limited to those listed. The scope of a contractor's efforts must depend upon all the circumstances, including the contractor's size and resources and the extent to which existing employment practices are adequate.</p>
                  <p>A. Develop internal communication of its obligation to engage in affirmative action efforts to employ qualified disabled persons in such a manner as to foster understanding, acceptance, and support among the contractor's executive, management, supervisory, and all other employees and to encourage such persons to take the necessary action to aid the contractor in meeting this obligation.</p>
                  <p>B. Develop reasonable internal procedures to ensure that its obligation to engage in affirmative action to employ and promote qualified disabled persons is being fully implemented.</p>
                  <p>C. Periodically inform all employees and prospective employees of its commitment to engage in affirmative action to increase employment opportunities for qualified disabled persons.</p>
                  <p>D. Enlist the assistance and support of recruiting sources (including state employment security agencies, state vocational rehabilitation agencies or facilities, rehabilitation facilities, college placement officers, state education agencies, labor organizations, and organizations of or for disabled persons) for the contractor's commitment to provide meaningful employment opportunities to qualified disabled persons. Information on national organizations serving the disabled, many of which have state or local affiliates, can be obtained from the Clearinghouse on Disability Information, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services, United States Department of Education, (202) 732-1241 or (202) 732-1723 (Voice/TDD).</p>
                  <p>E. Engage in recruitment activities at educational institutions that participate in training of the disabled, such as schools for the blind, deaf, or developmentally disabled.</p>
                  <p>F. Establish meaningful contracts with appropriate social service agencies, organizations of and for disabled persons, vocational rehabilitation agencies or facilities, for such purposes as advice, technical assistance, and referral to potential employees. Technical assistance from the resources described in this paragraph may consist of advice on proper placement, recruitment, training, and accommodations contractors may undertake, but no such resource providing technical assistance must have the authority to approve or disapprove the acceptability of affirmative action programs.</p>
                  <p>G. Review employment records to determine the availability of promotable and transferable qualified known disabled persons presently employed, and to determine whether their present and potential skills are being fully utilized or developed.</p>
                  <p>H. Include disabled workers when employees are pictured in consumer, promotional, or help wanted advertising.</p>
                  <p>I. Send written notification of company policy to all subcontractors, vendors and suppliers, requesting that they act in a manner consistent with the contractor's policy on affirmative action.</p>
                  <p>J. Take positive steps to attract qualified disabled persons not currently in the work force who have requisite skills and can be recruited through affirmative action measures. These persons may be located through the local chapters of organizations of and for disabled persons described in part 5000.3552, subpart 6.</p>

                  <p>A. Include it in the contractor's policy manual.</p>
                  <p>B. Publicize it in the company newspaper, magazine, annual report, and other media.</p>
                  <p>C. Conduct special meetings with executive, management, and supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the policy and individual responsibility for effective implementation, making clear the chief executive officer's attitude.</p>

                  <p>I. Post the policy on company bulletin boards, including a statement that employees and applicants are protected from coercion, intimidation, interference, or discrimination for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under the Minnesota Human Rights Act.</p>

                  <p>Where a contractor fails to respond to a notice of deficiency within 15 days or the department determines that attempts to correct the deficiencies through conciliation and persuasion have been or would be unsuccessful or unproductive, the department may impose one or more of the sanctions set forth in Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36, subdivision 3. The department shall serve the contractor with notice of the sanctions by mailing a copy thereof to the contractor by first-class mail. The sanctions shall become effective 20 days after the notice is served.</p>
                  <p>A contractor may obtain a hearing regarding the department's determination of deficiencies or any sanctions which it has imposed by filing a written request for a hearing with the department within 20 days after service of the notice of sanction. The hearing shall be a contested case proceeding pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.57 to 14.69.</p>
                  <p>A. If a timely request for a hearing is filed, the commissioner shall issue and serve upon the contractor by certified mail a notice and order directing the contractor to appear at the hearing, at a time and place specified in the notice, and show cause why the sanctions determined by the department shall not be imposed.</p>
                  <p>B. The filing of a timely request for a hearing shall stay the enforcement of the sanctions in question until a final decision is issued or the request for a hearing is withdrawn or dismissed with prejudice. The failure of a contractor to appear at the hearing may be grounds for dismissal with prejudice.</p>
                  <p>C. The administrative law judge shall make and file with the commissioner a report stating the findings of fact, conclusions, and recommendations. The commissioner shall serve each party with a copy of the report by mail. Within 20 days after service of the report, any party including the department, may file with the commissioner and serve exceptions to the report and reasons in support of their exceptions.</p>
                  <p>D. Exceptions with respect to statements of fact or matters of law must be specific and must be stated and numbered separately. When exception is taken to a statement of fact, a corrected statement must be incorporated. If exception is taken to conclusions in the report, the points relied upon to support the exception must be stated and numbered separately. A reply to exceptions is not required, but may be filed by any party including the department within ten days after service of the exceptions to which reply is made along with proof of service thereof on all parties of record.</p>
                  <p>E. Exceptions and replies shall contain written arguments in support of the position taken by the party filing such exceptions or reply. An opportunity for oral argument before the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall be permitted if requested by a party at the time that they file their exceptions or reply, unless the commissioner in the exercise of discretion, determines that oral argument is unnecessary because the facts and legal arguments could be adequately presented by the briefs and records and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument. Oral arguments shall be limited to a discussion of legal questions and a restatement of facts in evidence. No new evidence shall be received at oral arguments.</p>
                  <p>F. Within 20 days from the date of the mailing by the commissioner of a final decision or order, any party including the department, may petition for a rehearing, or for an amendment or vacation of the findings of fact, decision or order, or for reconsideration or reargument. If the petition is for a rehearing, vacation, reconsideration, or reargument, the grounds relied upon shall be specifically set forth and the claimed errors clearly stated. If the petition is for an amendment of the findings of fact, decision, or order, it shall contain the desired proposed amendments, and the reasons for it shall be clearly stated. The petition shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding. An adverse party shall have ten days from the date of the service of the petition to answer and no reply will be permitted. The commissioner may grant or deny the petition without a hearing, or in the commissioner's discretion set a hearing thereon. Pending the decision of the commissioner on the petition, the commissioner may vacate and set aside the decision or order. No petition will extend the time of appeal from the decision or order.</p>
                  <p>G. A second petition for rehearing, amendment, or vacation of any finding of fact, decision, or order, reconsideration or reargument by the same party or parties and upon the same grounds as a former petition which has been considered and denied, will not be entertained.</p>
                  <p>Within ten days after the date that sanctions become effective, the department shall notify the state agency or state agencies which hold contracts with the affected contractor about the sanctions and make recommendations regarding whether such contracts shall be terminated pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36, subdivision 4.</p>

                  <p>The department shall routinely request from contractors affirmative action programs and supporting documentation, including the workforce analysis and support data for audit. As used throughout this part, the term "Affirmative Action Plan and supporting documentation" means the required contents of affirmative action plans, and methods of implementing those requirements set forth in part 5000.3420. "Workforce analysis" is defined as a listing of each job title as it appears in applicable collective bargaining agreements or payroll records (not job groups) ranked from the lowest paid to the highest paid within each department or other similar organizational unit including departmental or unit supervision. If there are separate work units or lines of progression within a department a separate list must be provided for each such work unit or line, including unit supervisors. For lines of progression there must be indicated the order of jobs in the line through which an employee could move to the top of the line. Where there are no formal progression lines or usual promotional sequences, job titles shall be listed by department, job family, or discipline, in order of wage rates or salary ranges. For each job title, the total number of incumbents, the total number of female and male incumbents in each of the following groups must be given: Blacks, Spanish-surnamed Americans, American Indians, and Orientals. The wage rate or salary range for each job title must be given. All job titles, including all managerial job titles, must be listed.</p>

Special reports that meet the criteria in subpart 4, item C may be requested from contractors as required, for submission to the department for complaint investigations and follow-up reviews performed within one year of a full compliance review. The commissioner shall approve other special compliance reviews that effectuate the purposes of, and are consistent with the other compliance reviews described in part 5000.3590 when exigent circumstances require an immediate on-site review.</p>

                  <p>On-site reviews must be conducted as follows in items A to F.</p>
                  <p>A. Each contractor shall permit access during normal business hours to its premises for the purpose of conducting on-site compliance reviews and inspecting and copying books, records, accounts, and other materials as may be relevant to compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36 and parts 5000.3400 to 5000.3600. Information obtained in this manner must be used only in connection with the administration or enforcement of the Minnesota Human Rights Act and in the furtherance of the act's objectives.</p>
                  <p>B. If upon examination of an affirmative action plan and included workforce analysis for desk audit, the department finds that the material submitted does not demonstrate a reasonable effort by the contractor to meet all the requirements which are applicable under parts 5000.3420 to 5000.3600 the on-site review need not be carried out and the enforcement procedures specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36 and part 5000.3570 shall be applicable. Otherwise, following a desk audit of the affirmative action plan and supporting documentation, the department shall schedule an on-site review of the establishment, provided that an on-site review need not be carried out when the department can determine that the contractor's affirmative action plan is acceptable. This determination must be based on the current desk audit and an on-site review conducted within the preceding 24 months and also must include an affirmative determination that the circumstances of the previous on-site review have not substantially changed.</p>
                  <p>C. The department shall request contractors who are scheduled for on-site reviews to have the information necessary to perform the review available on-site. Specifically, this includes:</p>
                  <p>(1) information necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis of apparent deficiencies in the contractors' utilization of women or minorities;</p>
                  <p>(2) information required for a complete and thorough understanding of data contained in or offered as support for the affirmative action plan; and</p>
                  <p>(3) information concerning matters relevant to a determination of compliance with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 363A.36 and parts 5000.3400 to 5000.3600, but not adequately addressed in the affirmative action plan.</p>
                  <p>D. The contractor shall be requested to furnish only the specific items of information which the compliance officer determines are:</p>
                  <p>(1) necessary for conducting the review and completing the standard compliance review report; and</p>
                  <p>(2) not contained in or able to be derived from the material submitted by the contractor.</p>
                  <p>E. In order to pursue certain issues uncovered in the compliance review, it may be necessary for the compliance officer to request certain additional information on-site even though such data have not been previously identified. The additional information must also meet the criteria in this part.</p>
                  <p>F. Where necessary, the compliance officer may take information made available during the on-site review off-site for further analysis. An off-site analysis shall be conducted where issues have arisen concerning deficiencies or an apparent violation which is only capable of being more thoroughly analyzed off-site before a determination of compliance is made.</p>

                  <p>If the contractor is concerned with the confidentiality of information such as lists of employees, employee names, reasons for termination, and pay data then alphabetic or numeric coding or the use of an index of pay and pay ranges is acceptable for desk audit purposes.</p>
                  <p>The contractor shall provide full access to all relevant data on-site as required by subpart 4, item A.</p>
                  <p>The contractor shall provide all data determined by the compliance officer to be necessary for off-site analysis pursuant to subpart 4, item F. The data may only be coded if the contractor makes the code available to the compliance officer. If the contractor believes that particular information which is to be taken off-site is not relevant to compliance, the contractor may request a ruling by the supervisor of the department's compliance division who shall issue a ruling within ten days. The contractor may appeal that ruling to the commissioner within ten days. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall issue a final ruling within ten days. The information in question may be withheld pending a ruling by the supervisor or if appealed, a final ruling by the commissioner. Data determined to be relevant to the investigation must be submitted to the compliance officer within five days of the ruling by the supervisor, or if appealed, within five days of the final ruling of the commissioner.</p>
