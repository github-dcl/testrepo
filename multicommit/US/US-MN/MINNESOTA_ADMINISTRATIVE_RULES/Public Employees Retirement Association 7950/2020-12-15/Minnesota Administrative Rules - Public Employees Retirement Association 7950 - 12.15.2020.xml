                  <p>Parts 7950.0500 to 7950.0520 implement Minnesota Statutes, section 353.30, subdivision 3, by establishing the specific joint and survivor options that the Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) offers and the actuarial standards and assumptions which will be used to determine joint and survivor annuity and benefit option percentage factors. These factors will, in turn, be used to calculate joint and survivor annuity or benefit amounts under each option type. The percentage factors as determined must yield joint and survivor annuity or benefit amounts that are actuarially equivalent to the normal (for example: single life) annuity or benefit amounts provided under Minnesota Statutes, sections 353.29; 353.30; 353.32, subdivision 1a; 353.33; 353.651; 353.656; 353.657, subdivision 2a; 353.71; 356.30; 356.32; and 356.70.</p>

PERA shall apply these joint and survivor option percentage factors from the table in determining the monthly joint and survivor annuity or benefit amount for those members and their designated optional annuity beneficiaries who select a joint and survivor option. The effect of applying the specific factors for the option types selected by members to the normal annuity or benefit amounts that these same members would otherwise receive shall yield joint and survivor annuity or benefit amounts, the actuarial present value of which shall equal the actuarial present value of those members' normal annuity or benefit amounts.</p>
