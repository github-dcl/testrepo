A dentist's general anesthesia or moderate sedation certificate expires if the completed application and the nonrefundable fee described in Minnesota Statutes, section 150A.091, subdivision 11, are not received by the board by the application deadline. Immediately upon expiration of a certificate, the dentist is prohibited from administering general anesthesia, deep sedation, or moderate sedation in the practice of dentistry until the board issues a current general anesthesia or moderate sedation certificate to the dentist described in subpart 9a. After 60 days from the renewal application deadline, the board will terminate the dentist's general anesthesia or moderate sedation certificate and send a notice of termination to the dentist.</p>
                  <p>(6) Upon receipt of an application for renewal of a general anesthesia or moderate sedation certificate, the board may require that the dentist undergo an on-site inspection described in subpart 11 or further review of the dentist's anesthesia/sedation credentials. The board may direct an anesthesia consultant or qualified anesthetic practitioner who has been approved by the board and provided with board-established guidelines to assist in the inspection or review.</p>
                  <p>(7) Upon granting an application, receiving payment of the required fee, and, if required, receiving notice of having successfully passed an on-site inspection and evaluation, the board shall issue a general anesthesia or moderate sedation certificate to the dentist.</p>

                  <p>A. The initial professional development cycle must coincide with the initial licensure period for each dentist, dental therapist, dental hygienist, or licensed dental assistant. The initial cycle for each licensee begins on the date of initial licensure and ends on the last day of the licensee's birth month in either an even-numbered or odd-numbered year that corresponds with the licensee's year of birth. The initial cycle varies in the number of months depending on the date of initial licensure for each licensee.</p>
                  <p>B. A biennial professional development cycle coincides with the biennial licensure periods for each dentist, dental therapist, dental hygienist, or licensed dental assistant. Each biennial renewal cycle consists of a 24-month period beginning on the first day of the month following expiration of the previous professional development cycle. An established biennial cycle continues to apply even if the license is revoked, suspended, conditioned, or not renewed for any reason for any length of time.</p>

                  <p>C. Professional development is credited on an hour-for-hour basis.</p>
                  <p>D. If a licensee fails to meet the professional development requirements because of extenuating circumstances, the licensee may apply for an extension of time to complete the requirements by making a written request to the board. The written request shall include a complete explanation of the circumstances, the renewal period, the number of hours earned, and the licensee's plan for completing the balance of the requirement.
