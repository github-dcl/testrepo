    <p>The waste management goal of the state is to foster an integrated waste management system in a manner appropriate to the characteristics of the waste stream and thereby protect the state's land, air, water, and other natural resources and the public health. The agency supports the management of solid waste in accordance with the goals stated in Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/115A.02">115A.02</a>, paragraph (a), which emphasize reducing toxicity and volume of wastes. In recognition that wastes may have value and should be viewed as a resource, the goal of solid waste management should be to use wastes for their highest and best value and to dispose of them only after other feasible options have been evaluated or for environmental protection.</p>

The commissioner shall inform the owner or operator of the inflation factor needed to adjust cost estimates. Adjustments must be made by multiplying the latest cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is the adjusted cost estimate.</p>
      <p>In addition to any yearly update made under this subpart, the owner or operator must revise the cost estimates whenever a change in site conditions increases the cost of closure, postclosure care, or corrective action. The revised cost estimates must be adjusted for inflation as specified in this subpart.</p>

      <p>A trust agreement for a trust fund as specified in part <a href="/rules/7035.2705">7035.2705</a> must be worded as specified in this subpart, except that instructions in brackets must be replaced with the relevant information and the brackets deleted.</p>
      <p class="ce">TRUST AGREEMENT</p>
      <p>Trust Agreement, the "Agreement," entered into on [date] by [name of the owner or operator], a [name of state] [insert "corporation," "partnership," "association," or "proprietorship"], the "Grantor," and [name of corporate trustee,], [insert "incorporated in the state of ___________________" or "a national bank"], the "Trustee."</p>
      <p>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (Agency), an agency of the state of Minnesota, has established rules applicable to the Grantor, requiring that an owner or operator of a solid waste management facility shall provide assurance that funds will be available when needed for closure and/or postclosure care of, and/or contingency action for, the facility.</p>
      <p>The Grantor has chosen a trust to provide the financial assurance for the facilities identified herein.</p>
      <p>The Grantor, acting through its duly authorized officers, has selected the Trustee to be the trustee under this agreement, and the Trustee is willing to act as trustee.</p>
      <p>The Grantor and the Trustee agree as follows:</p>
      <p>Section 1. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:</p>
      <p>a. The term "Grantor" means the owner or operator who enters into this Agreement and any successors or assigns of the Grantor.</p>
      <p>b. The term "Trustee" means the Trustee who enters into this Agreement and any successor Trustee.</p>
      <p>c. The term "Beneficiary" means the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and any successor agency.</p>
      <p>Section 2. Identification of Facilities and Cost Estimates. This agreement pertains to the facilities and cost estimates, if any, identified on attached Schedule A [on Schedule A, for each facility list the identification number, name, address, and the current contingency action, closure, and/or postclosure cost estimates, or portions thereof, for which financial assurance is demonstrated by this Agreement].</p>
      <p>Section 3. Establishment of Fund. The Grantor and the Trustee hereby establish a trust fund, the "Fund," for the benefit of the Agency. The Grantor and the Trustee intend that no third party have access to the Fund except as herein provided. The Fund is established initially as consisting of the property, which is acceptable to the Trustee, described in Schedule B attached hereto. This property and any other property subsequently transferred to the Trustee is referred to as the Fund, together with all earnings, and profits on earnings, less any payments or distributions made by the Trustee under this Agreement. The Fund shall be held by the Trustee, IN TRUST, as hereinafter provided. The Trustee shall not be responsible nor shall it undertake any responsibility for the amount or adequacy of, nor any duty to collect from the Grantor, any payments necessary to discharge any liabilities of the Grantor established by the Agency.</p>
      <p>Section 4. Payment for Contingency Action, Closure, and Postclosure Care. The Trustee shall make payments from the Fund as the Agency Commissioner shall specify, in writing, to provide for the payment of the costs of contingency action, closure, and/or postclosure care of the facilities covered by this Agreement. The Trustee shall reimburse the Grantor or other persons as specified by the Agency Commissioner from the Fund for contingency action, closure, and postclosure expenditures in amounts the Agency Commissioner shall specify in writing. In addition, the Trustee shall refund to the Grantor the amounts the Agency Commissioner specifies in writing. Upon refund, these funds shall no longer constitute part of the Fund as defined herein.</p>
      <p>Section 5. Payments Comprising the Fund. Payments made to the Trustee for the Fund shall consist of cash or securities acceptable to the Trustee.</p>
      <p>Section 6. Trustee Management. In investing, reinvesting, exchanging, selling, and managing the Fund, the Trustee shall discharge his or her duties with respect to the trust fund solely in the interest of the beneficiary and with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing which persons of prudence, acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters, would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; except that:</p>
      <p>a. securities or other obligations of the Grantor, or any other owner or operator of the facilities, or any of their affiliates as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, United States Code, title 15, section 80a-2(a), shall not be acquired or held, unless they are securities or other obligations of the federal or state government;</p>
      <p>b. the Trustee is authorized to invest the Fund in time or demand deposits of the Trustee, to the extent insured by an agency of the federal or state government; and</p>
      <p>c. the Trustee is authorized to hold cash awaiting investment or distribution uninvested for a reasonable time and without liability for the payment of interest thereon.</p>
      <p>Section 7. Commingling and Investment. The Trustee is expressly authorized in its discretion:</p>
      <p>a. to transfer from time to time any or all of the assets of the Fund to any common, commingled, or collective trust fund created by the Trustee in which the Fund is eligible to participate, subject to all of the provisions thereof, to be commingled with the assets of others participating therein; and</p>
      <p>b. to purchase shares in any investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, United States Code, title 15, sections 80a-1 et seq. including one which may be created, managed, underwritten, or to which investment advice is rendered or the shares of which are sold by the Trustee. The Trustee may vote such shares in its discretion.</p>
      <p>Section 8. Express Powers of Trustee. Without in any way limiting the powers and discretions conferred upon the Trustee by the other provisions of this Agreement or by law, the Trustee is expressly authorized and empowered:</p>
      <p>a. To sell, exchange, convey, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any property held by it, by public or private sale. No person dealing with the Trustee may be bound to see to the application of the purchase money or to inquire into the validity or expediency of a sale or other disposition.</p>
      <p>b. To make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all documents of transfer and conveyance and any and all other instruments that may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the powers herein granted.</p>
      <p>c. To register any securities held in the Fund in its own name or in the name of a nominee and to hold any security in bearer form or in book entry, or to combine certificates representing the securities with certificates of the same issue held by the Trustee in other fiduciary capacities, or to deposit or arrange for the deposit of the securities in a qualified central depository even though, when so deposited, the securities may be merged and held in bulk in the name of the nominee of the depository with other securities deposited therein by another person, or to deposit or arrange for the deposit of any securities issued by the United States Government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, with a federal reserve bank, but the books and records of the Trustee shall at all times show that all these securities are part of the Fund.</p>
      <p>d. To deposit any cash in the Fund in interest-bearing accounts maintained or savings certificates issued by the Trustee, in its separate corporate capacity, or in any other banking institution affiliated with the Trustee, to the extent insured by an agency of the federal or state government.</p>
      <p>Section 9. Taxes and Expenses. All taxes of any kind that may be assessed or levied against or in respect of the Fund and all brokerage commissions incurred by the Fund shall be paid from the Fund. All other expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the administration of this Trust, including fees for legal services rendered to the Trustee, the compensation of the Trustee to the extent not paid directly by the Grantor, and all other proper charges and disbursements of the Trustee shall be paid from the Fund.</p>
      <p>Section 10. Annual Valuation. The Trustee shall annually, at least 30 days prior to the anniversary date of establishment of the Fund, furnish to the Grantor and to the Agency Commissioner a statement confirming the value of the Trust. Any securities in the fund shall be valued at market value as of no more than 60 days prior to the anniversary date of establishment of the Fund. The failure of the Grantor to object in writing to the Trustee within 90 days after the statement has been furnished to the Grantor and the Agency Commissioner shall constitute a conclusively binding assent by the Grantor, barring the Grantor from asserting any claim or liability against the Trustee with respect to matters disclosed in the statement.</p>
      <p>Section 11. Advice of Counsel. The trustee may from time to time consult with counsel, with respect to any question arising as to the construction of this Agreement or any action to be taken hereunder. The Trustee shall be fully protected, to the extent permitted by law, in acting upon the advice of counsel.</p>
      <p>Section 12. Trustee Compensation. The Trustee shall be entitled to reasonable compensation for its services as agreed upon in writing from time to time with the Grantor.</p>
      <p>Section 13. Successor Trustee. The Trustee may resign or the Grantor may replace the Trustee, but the resignation or replacement shall not be effective until the Grantor has appointed a successor trustee and this successor accepts the appointment. The successor trustee shall have the same powers and duties as those conferred upon the Trustee hereunder. Upon the successor trustee's acceptance of the appointment, the Trustee shall assign, transfer, and pay over to the successor trustee the funds and properties then constituting the Fund. If for any reasons the Grantor cannot or does not act in the event of the resignation of the Trustee, the Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee or for instructions. The successor trustee shall specify the date on which it assumes administration of the trust in a writing sent to the Grantor, the Agency Commissioner and the present Trustee by certified mail ten days before the change becomes effective. Any expenses incurred by the Trustee as a result of any of the acts contemplated by this Section shall be paid as provided in Section 9.</p>
      <p>Section 14. Instructions to the Trustee. All orders, requests, and instructions by the Agency to the Trustee shall be in writing, signed by the Agency Commissioner; and the Trustee shall act and shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with the orders, requests, and instructions. The Trustee shall have the right to assume, in the absence of written notice to the contrary, that no event constituting a change or a termination of the authority of any person to act on behalf of the Grantor or the Agency hereunder has occurred. The Trustee shall have no duty to act in the absence of orders, requests, and instructions from the Agency Commissioner, except as provided herein.</p>
      <p>Section 15. Notice of Nonpayment. The Trustee shall notify the Grantor and the Agency Commissioner by certified mail within ten days if no payment is received from the grantor by the end of the month. After the pay-in period is completed, the Trustee shall not be required to send a notice of nonpayment.</p>
      <p>Section 16. Amendment of Agreement. This agreement may be amended by an instrument in writing executed by the Grantor, the Trustee, and the Agency Commissioner, or by the Trustee and the Agency Commissioner if the Grantor ceases to exist.</p>
      <p>Section 17. Irrevocability and Termination. Subject to the right of the parties to amend this Agreement as provided in Section 13 and in Section 16, this Trust shall be irrevocable and shall continue until terminated at the written agreement of the Grantor, the Trustee, and the Agency Commissioner, or by the Trustee and the Agency Commissioner, if the Grantor ceases to exist. Upon termination of the Trust, all remaining trust property, less final trust administration expenses, shall be delivered to the Grantor or to any successors or assigns of the Grantor.</p>
      <p>Section 18. Immunity and Indemnification. The Trustee shall not incur personal liability of any nature in connection with any act or omission, made in good faith, in the administration of this Trust, or in carrying out any directions by the Agency Commissioner issued in accordance with this Agreement. The Trustee shall be indemnified and saved harmless by the Grantor or from the Trust Fund, or both, from and against any personal liability to which the Trustee may be subjected by reason of any act or conduct in its official capacity, including all expenses reasonably incurred in its defense in the event the Grantor fails to provide a defense.</p>
      <p>Section 19. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be administered, construed, and enforced according to the laws of the state of Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Section 20. Interpretation. As used in this Agreement, words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular. The descriptive headings for each Section of this Agreement shall not affect the interpretation or the legal efficacy of this Agreement.</p>

      <p>The Principal is required to provide financial assurance for closure; closure and postclosure care; closure and contingency action; or closure, postclosure care and contingency action as a condition of the permit, and</p>
      <p>The Principal shall establish a standby trust fund as required when a surety bond is used to provide financial assurance:</p>
      <p>If the Principal shall faithfully, before the beginning of final closure of each facility identified above, fund the standby trust fund in the amount(s) identified above for the closure and/or postclosure care of the facility,</p>
      <p>Or, if the Principal shall fund the standby trust fund in the amount(s) identified above for closure and/or postclosure care of the facility within 15 days after an order to begin closure is issued by the Agency Commissioner, the Agency, or court of competent jurisdiction,</p>

      <p>The Surety(ies) shall become liable on this bond obligation only when the Principal has failed to fulfill the conditions described above. Upon notification by the Agency Commissioner that the Principal has failed to perform as guaranteed by this bond, the Surety(ies) shall place funds in the amount guaranteed for the facility(ies) into the standby trust fund as directed by the Agency Commissioner.</p>
      <p>The liability of the Surety(ies) shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder, unless and until payment or payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penal sum of the bond, but in no event shall the obligation of the Surety(ies) hereunder exceed the amount of said penal sum.</p>
      <p>The Surety(ies) may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the Principal and to the Agency Commissioner, provided, however, that cancellation shall not occur during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by the Agency Commissioner, as evidenced by the return receipts.</p>
      <p>The Principal may terminate this bond by sending written notice to the Surety(ies) provided, however, that no such notice shall become effective until the Surety(ies) receive(s) written authorization for termination of the bond by the Agency Commissioner.</p>
      <p>(The following paragraph is an optional rider that may be included but is not required.)</p>
      <p>Principal and Surety(ies) agree to adjust the penal sum of the bond yearly so that it guarantees a new contingency action, closure and/or postclosure amount, provided that the penal sum does not increase by more than 20 percent in any one year, and no decrease in the penal sum takes place without the written permission of the Agency Commissioner.</p>

      <p>A corporate guarantee, as specified in part <a href="/rules/7035.2750">7035.2750</a>, item C, must be worded as specified in this subpart, except that instructions in brackets must be replaced with relevant information and the brackets deleted.</p>
      <p class="ce">CORPORATE GUARANTEE FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION, CLOSURE, OR POSTCLOSURE CARE</p>
      <p>Guarantee made this [date] by [name of guaranteeing entity], a business corporation organized under the laws of the state of [insert name of state], herein referred to as guarantor, to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (Agency), obligee, on behalf of our subsidiary [facility owner or operator] of [business address].</p>
      <p>Recitals:</p>
      <p>1. Guarantor meets or exceeds the financial test criteria and agrees to comply with the reporting requirements for guarantors specified in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/7035.2750">7035.2750</a>, item C.</p>
      <p>2. [Facility owner or operator] owns or operates the following solid waste disposal facilities covered by this guarantee: [List for each facility: identification number, name, and address. Indicate for each whether the guarantee is for corrective action, closure, postclosure care, or any combination of the three.]</p>
      <p>3. "Closure plans," "postclosure plans," and "contingency action plans" as used below refer to the plans maintained as required by Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/7035.2615">7035.2615</a>, <a href="/rules/7035.2625">7035.2625</a>, and <a href="/rules/7035.2645">7035.2645</a> for the closure, postclosure care, and corrective action needs of facilities identified above.</p>
      <p>4. For value received from [facility owner or operator], guarantor guarantees to the Agency that in the event the [facility owner or operator] fails to perform [insert "corrective action," "closure," "postclosure care," or any combination of the three] of the above facilities in accordance with the corrective action, closure, or postclosure plans and other permit requirements whenever required to do so, the guarantor shall do so or establish a trust fund as specified in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/7035.2705">7035.2705</a>, in the name of [facility owner or operator] in the amount of the current corrective action, closure, or postclosure cost estimates as specified in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/7035.2705">7035.2705</a>.</p>
      <p>5. Guarantor guarantees that if, at the end of any fiscal year before termination of this guarantee, the guarantor fails to meet the financial test criteria, guarantor shall send within 90 days, by certified mail, notice to the agency and [facility owner or operator] that he or she intends to provide financial assurance as specified in Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/7035.2665">7035.2665</a> to <a href="/rules/7035.2805">7035.2805</a>, as applicable, in the name of [facility owner or operator]. Within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year, the guarantor shall establish financial assurance unless [facility owner or operator] has done so.</p>
      <p>6. The guarantor agrees to notify the Agency Commissioner by certified mail of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under title 11 or title 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, naming guarantor as debtor, within ten days after commencement of the proceeding.</p>
      <p>7. Guarantor agrees that within 30 days after being notified by the Agency Commissioner of a determination that guarantor no longer meets the financial test criteria or that he or she is disallowed from continuing as a guarantor of corrective action, closure, or postclosure care, guarantor shall establish alternate financial assurance as specified in Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/7035.2665">7035.2665</a> to <a href="/rules/7035.2805">7035.2805</a>, as applicable, in the name of [facility owner or operator] unless [facility owner or operator] has done so.</p>
      <p>8. Guarantor agrees to remain bound under this guarantee notwithstanding any or all of the following: amendment or modification of the corrective action, closure, or postclosure plan; amendment or modification of the permit; extension or reduction of the time of performance of corrective action, closure, or postclosure care; or any other modification or alteration of an obligation of the facility owner or operator pursuant to Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/7001.0200">7001.0200</a> to <a href="/rules/7001.1220">7001.1220</a>; and <a href="/rules/7001.1400">7001.1400</a> to <a href="/rules/7001.3550">7001.3550</a>; or <a href="/rules/7035.0300">7035.0300</a> to <a href="/rules/7035.2875">7035.2875</a>.</p>
      <p>9. Guarantor agrees to remain bound under this guarantee for so long as [facility owner or operator] must comply with the applicable financial assurance requirements of Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/7035.2665">7035.2665</a> to <a href="/rules/7035.2805">7035.2805</a>, for the above-listed facilities, except that guarantor may cancel this guarantee by sending notice by certified mail to the Agency Commissioner and [facility owner or operator], the cancellation to become effective no earlier than 120 days after receipt of notice by the Agency Commissioner, as evidenced by return receipt.</p>
      <p>10. Guarantor agrees that if [facility owner or operator] fails to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/7035.2665">7035.2665</a> to <a href="/rules/7035.2805">7035.2805</a>, as applicable, and obtain written approval of such assurance from the Agency Commissioner within 90 days after a notice of cancellation by the guarantor is received by the Agency Commissioner, guarantor shall provide alternate financial assurance in the name of [facility owner or operator].</p>
      <p>11. Guarantor expressly waives notice of acceptance of this guarantee by the Agency or by [facility owner or operator]. Guarantor also expressly waives notice of amendments or modifications of the contingency action, closure, or postclosure care plan and of amendments or modifications of the facility permits.</p>
      <p>I hereby certify that the wording of this guarantee is identical to the wording specified in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/7035.2805">7035.2805</a>, subpart 7, as such rules were constituted on the date first above written.</p>

If the background water quality is inadequately defined, the commissioner may require additional evaluation including sampling, statistical analysis of sampling data, and installation of additional monitoring points.

          <p> Upon request by the owner or operator, the commissioner may establish alternative limits for some or all substances for portions of a facility filled before November 15, 1988. Unless approved by the agency, or by the commissioner as provided in subitem (1), the alternative limits must not exceed four times the concentrations given in item F. The owner or operator must have completed a remedial investigation study evaluating the extent and severity of ground water pollution at the facility and a feasibility study evaluating the feasibility and the environmental and economic costs, risks, and benefits of the possible alternative corrective actions. The alternative approaches must include corrective actions intended to achieve compliance with the standards under items E and F and at least one additional approach intended to maintain ground water concentrations lower than four times the concentrations under item F. The feasibility study also must evaluate the pollutant concentrations that would remain in ground water after corrective action and the extent to which the use of these alternative limits may adversely affect the immediate and future use of ground water downgradient from the facility.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Liner requirements. </h2>
      <p>Any previously unfilled portion of an existing mixed municipal solid waste land disposal facility or any portion of a new mixed municipal solid waste land disposal facility must be lined. An extension of 18 months from November 15, 1988, may be granted by the commissioner to the owner or operator of an existing mixed municipal solid waste land disposal facility provided the owner or operator shows that the liner is unnecessary for that time based on: subsurface geologic conditions; ground water and surface water flow patterns; ground water and surface water quality; depth to ground water; distance to surface water; remaining site capacity; design and construction techniques to be used to mitigate leachate generation; and other site conditions that exist and will minimize impacts on the environment.</p>
      <p>A liner is not required for existing disposal areas at existing mixed municipal solid waste land disposal facilities that will be expanded vertically. However, a permit for a vertical expansion may be granted by the commissioner only if the owner or operator shows that the expansion will not increase the potential for harm to human health or the environment. The owner or operator shall submit to the commissioner an engineering and hydrogeologic report containing a detailed analysis of the impact the expansion would have on the environment and human health. The report must also contain the design and construction modifications to be used at the facility to minimize impacts on the environment. The report must include a hydrogeologic evaluation as outlined in subpart 3; a feasibility study on minimizing leachate generation, controlling leachate movement, and on treating ground water and surface water pollution; an evaluation of long-term monitoring; and an appropriate adjustment to the financial instruments in place for the facility.</p>
      <p>The liner installed at a mixed municipal solid waste land disposal facility must comply with the requirements of items A to N. The lined portion of the disposal area must be separated from any existing fill area by low permeability material to the extent practicable, be designed to collect the additional water movement from the old fill area to the new fill area, and prevent movement of water from the new fill area to the old fill area.</p>

The commissioner shall approve a waste for codisposal in a municipal solid waste combustor ash disposal facility only if the commissioner determines that codisposal of that waste will not significantly increase the movement of leachate generated at the facility, which contaminates outside the codisposal ash phase by leakage, leaching, or fugitive dust emissions.</p>

      <p>After January 1, 1993, the owner or operator of a waste combustor ash land disposal facility may not dispose of ash which exceeds the maximum leachable contaminant levels of subpart 5, unless the facility design either meets or exceeds the requirements of subparts 10, item C, subitem (3); and 11, item O or P, or if the facility is a type II cell which meets or exceeds the requirements in part <a href="/rules/7035.2915">7035.2915</a> and is approved prior to or during the nine-month period immediately following adoption of parts <a href="/rules/7001.0040">7001.0040</a> to <a href="/rules/7035.2915">7035.2915</a>, whichever applies. Compliance with this subpart must be based on results of testing ash using EPA Method 1312 as required by part <a href="/rules/7035.2910">7035.2910</a>, except as provided by items B to D. Alternatively, the commissioner may approve treatment within the land disposal facility if treatment reduces contaminant mobility so that any pollutants detected in leachate will not exceed the maximum leachable contaminant levels of subpart 5.
