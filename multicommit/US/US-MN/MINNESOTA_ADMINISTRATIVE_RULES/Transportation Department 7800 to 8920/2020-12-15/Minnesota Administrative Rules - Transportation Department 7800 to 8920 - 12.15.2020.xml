                  <p>An object will be considered an obstruction to a public airport (excluding seaplane bases and heliports) if it is of greater height than any of the following airport imaginary surfaces:</p>
                  <p>A. Primary surface: an imaginary surface longitudinally centered on a runway and extending 200 feet beyond each end of a runway with a specially prepared hard surface or coinciding with each end of other runways.</p>
                  <p>The width of the primary surface is 120 feet for visual runways at special-purpose airports, 250 feet for visual utility runways, or 500 feet for nonprecision instrument runways and for visual runways other than utility, or 1,000 feet for precision instrument runways and for nonprecision instrument runways having visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile.</p>
                  <p>The primary surface for each end of a runway has the same arithmetical value. The value is the highest determined for either end of the runway.</p>
                  <p>The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.</p>
                  <p>B. Horizontal surface: an imaginary horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is:</p>
                  <p>(1) 5,000 feet for all runways designated as utility or visual; and</p>
                  <p>(2) 10,000 feet for all other runways. The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway has the same arithmetical value. The value is the highest determined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000-foot arcs, the 5,000-foot arc must be disregarded in the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal surface.</p>
                  <p>C. Conical surface: an imaginary conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet as measured radially outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface.</p>
                  <p>D. Approach surface: an imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at each end of a runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is at the same width and elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary surface.</p>
                  <p>The approach surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of: 15:1 for a horizontal distance of 3,000 feet for visual runways at special-purpose airports, 20:1 for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet for utility runways and visual other than utility runways, or 34:1 for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet for all nonprecision instrument runways other than utility.</p>
                  <p>The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 1,020 feet at a distance of 3,000 feet from the end of the primary surface for visual runways at special-purpose airports, or 1,250 feet for visual utility runways, or 1,500 feet for visual runways other than utility, or 2,000 feet for utility runways with a nonprecision instrument approach, or 3,500 feet for nonprecision instrument runways other than utility, having visibility minimums greater than three-fourths statute mile, or 4,000 feet for nonprecision instrument runways other than utility, having visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile.</p>
                  <p>E. Precision instrument approach surface: an imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at the end of a precision instrument runway. The inner edge of the precision instrument approach surface is at the same width and elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary surface. The precision instrument approach surface inclines upward and outward for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet at a slope of 50:1, expanding uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet, then continues upward and outward for an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet at a slope of 40:1, expanding uniformly to an ultimate width of 16,000 feet.</p>
                  <p>F. Transitional surface: an imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 4:1 for visual runways at special-purpose airports, or 7:1 for all other runways. The transitional surfaces incline upward and outward from the sides of the primary surfaces and from the sides of the approach surfaces until they intersect the horizontal surface or the conical surface. Transitional surface for those portions of the instrument approach surface that project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the sides of the approach surface and at right angles to the extended instrument runway centerline.</p>

                  <p>B. Heliport approach surface: the heliport approach surface begins at each end of the primary surface, with the same width as the primary surface and extends outward and upward at a slope of 8:1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet where its width is 500 feet.</p>
                  <p>C. Heliport transitional surface: the heliport transitional surfaces extend outward and upward from the lateral boundaries of the primary surface and from the approach surfaces at a slope of 2:1 for a distance of 250 feet measured horizontally from the centerline of the primary and approach surfaces.</p>

                  <p>The following land use safety zones are established with relation to an airport and each runway:</p>
                  <p>Safety zone A: in the approach zones of a runway, safety zone A extends outward from the end of the primary surface a distance equal to two-thirds the runway length or planned runway length.</p>
                  <p>Safety zone B: in the approach zones of a runway, safety zone B extends outward from safety zone A a distance equal to one-third the runway length or the planned runway length.</p>
                  <p>Safety zone C: all that land which is enclosed within the perimeter of the horizontal zone defined in subpart 3, item B and which is not included in zone A or zone B.</p>

                  <p>In order to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from an airport, and furthermore to limit population and building density in the runway approach areas, thereby creating sufficient open space so as to protect life and property in case of accident, the following use restrictions are applied to the land use safety zones.</p>
                  <p>A. No use shall be made of any land in any of the safety zones which creates or causes interference with the operation of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft, makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endangers the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft.</p>
                  <p>B. Zone A shall contain no buildings, temporary structures, exposed transmission lines, or other similar land use structural hazards, and shall be restricted to those uses which will not create, attract, or bring together an assembly of persons thereon. Permitted uses may include, but are not limited to, such uses as agriculture (seasonal crops), horticulture, raising of livestock, animal husbandry, wildlife habitat, light outdoor recreation (nonspectator), cemeteries, and auto parking.</p>
                  <p>C. Zone B shall be restricted in use as follows. Each use shall be on a site whose area shall not be less than three acres. Each use shall not create, attract, or bring together a site population that would exceed 15 times that of the site acreage. Each site shall have no more than one building plot upon which any number of structures may be erected.</p>
                  <p>A building plot shall be single, uniform, and noncontrived area, whose shape is uncomplicated and whose area shall not exceed the following minimum ratios with respect to the total site area:</p>

                  <p>The following uses are specifically prohibited in zone B: churches, hospitals, schools, theaters, stadiums, hotels and motels, trailer courts, camp grounds, and other places of public or semipublic assembly.</p>
                  <p>D. Zone C is subject only to the general restrictions contained in item A.</p>
                  <p>E. The provisions of items B and C shall not apply to land uses, in "established residential neighborhoods in built up urban areas." Such "established residential neighborhoods in built up areas" shall be subject to the use restrictions contained in this paragraph.</p>
                  <p>(1) Airport safety zoning balances the public interest involved in safety for persons on the ground, safety of persons traveling in aircraft, and the public interest in maintaining existing land uses. The legislature has mandated special protection for existing land uses in "established residential neighborhoods in built up urban areas." The provisions of items A to D strike the appropriate balance with regard to other land uses and areas and shall therefore be applied in those cases.</p>
                  <p>(2) Each governmental authority having airport zoning powers shall determine which areas located in safety zones A and B of each airport within its jurisdiction are also located in "established residential neighborhoods in built up urban areas." In making such determination, the factors enumerated in subitem (4) shall be considered. Such neighborhoods located in whole or part in safety zones A or B shall be specifically located on the airport zoning map and shall be legally described in the airport zoning ordinance. Each governmental authority having airport zoning powers shall submit its proposed zoning map and ordinance to the commissioner of transportation for review and approval prior to holding a public hearing or taking other action thereon.</p>
                  <p>(3) No land use in safety zones A or B and in an area designated as having been an "established residential neighborhood in a built up urban area" shall be prohibited by an airport zoning ordinance except as provided in subitem (5). In addition, any isolated low density residential building lot or low density residential structure which existed on January 1, 1978, in an "established residential neighborhood in a built up urban area," must either be allowed to continue as a conforming use under the terms of the local zoning ordinance or must be acquired, altered, or removed as provided in subitem (6). For this purpose, a low density residential structure shall mean a single family or two family home and an isolated low density residential building lot shall mean a single lot located in an area which is zoned for single family or two family residences and in which the predominant land use is such type of residences.</p>
                  <p>(4) In determining what constitutes an "established residential neighborhood in a built up urban area" the governmental unit having zoning powers shall apply and consider the following criteria in relation to the neighborhood as it existed on June 30, 1979:</p>
                  <p>(a) location of the airport;</p>
                  <p>(b) nature of the terrain within safety zones A and B;</p>
                  <p>(c) existing land uses and character of the neighborhood around the airport;</p>
                  <p>(d) population of the community;</p>
                  <p>(e) that the average population density in all areas within one mile of any point on a runway be equal to or greater than one dwelling unit per acre;</p>
                  <p>(f) population density near the airport compared with population density in other areas of the community;</p>
                  <p>(g) the age and the economic, political, and social stability of the neighborhood and the community as a whole;</p>
                  <p>(h) the proximity of supporting school, commercial, religious, transportation, and other facilities and their degree of integration with residential land uses;</p>
                  <p>(i) presence or absence of public utilities including, but not limited to public central sanitary sewer system electric service and gas mains;</p>
                  <p>(j) whether or not the factors listed in units (h) and (i) tend to make the community surrounding the airport a self sufficient unit;</p>
                  <p>(k) whether the areas within one mile of the perimeter of the airport property would be considered primarily residential in character; and</p>
                  <p>(l) other material factors deemed relevant by the governmental unit in distinguishing the area in question as established, residential, urban, and built up.</p>
                  <p>(5) Safety hazards: The following land uses if they exist in safety zones A or B and in an "established residential neighborhood in a built up urban area" are considered by the commissioner to constitute airport safety hazards so severe, either to persons on the ground or to the air traveling public, or both, that they must be prohibited under local airport zoning ordinances:</p>
                  <p>(a) any structure which a person or persons customarily use as a principal residence and which is located entirely within safety zone A and within 1,000 feet of the end of the primary zone;</p>
                  <p>(b) any structure which a person or persons customarily use as a principal residence and which is located entirely within safety zone A or B and which penetrates an imaginary approach surface as defined by part 8800.1200, subpart 5, item D;</p>
                  <p>(c) any land use in safety zone A or B which violates any of the following standards: the land use must not create or cause interference with the operation of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft; the land use must not make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights; and the land use must not result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport or impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport;</p>
                  <p>(d) any isolated residential building lot zoned for single family or two family residences on which any structure, if built, would be prohibited by unit (a), (b), or (c). An "isolated" residential building lot is one located in an area in which the predominant land use is single family or two family residential structures; and</p>
                  <p>(e) any other land use which presents, in the opinion of the commissioner, a material danger to the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft or to the safety of persons on the ground. In making such a determination, the commissioner shall consider the following factors:</p>
                  <p>i. possibility that the land use may contribute to or cause a collision of two or more aircraft or an aircraft and some other object;</p>
                  <p>ii. possibility that the land use may, in case of an aircraft accident, cause an explosion, fire, or the release of harmful or noxious fumes, gases, or substances;</p>
                  <p>iii. tendency of the land use to increase the number of persons that would be injured in case of an aircraft accident;</p>

                  <p>(6) In the case of any land use prohibited by subpart 6, item E, subitem (5) and which is located in an "established residential neighborhood in a built up urban area" as defined by the local government unit and reviewed and approved by the commissioner, the prohibited land use must be acquired, altered, or removed at public expense by the governmental body which owns the airport. This may be accomplished by an exchange of land, purchase of development rights, acquisition of easements, or other method to be negotiated with the landowner or by outright purchase or exercise of eminent domain, if necessary.</p>
                  <p>(7) The prohibited uses enumerated in subpart 6, item E, subitem (5) are only those which present the most severe safety hazards to the air traveling public or persons on the ground, as the case may be. Local governmental units may also prohibit other land uses in safety zones A and B as being unsafe to the public. The use restrictions contained in items A to D provide guidance as to what uses the commissioner deems not to be public interest in these safety zones. See also subitem (5), units (c) and (e). The local governmental unit must note the requirement of Minnesota Statutes 1978, section 360.066, subdivision 1a, paragraphs (a) and (d) that certain prohibited land uses must be acquired, altered, or removed at public expense.</p>
                  <p>(8) In the event that the provisions of this item, as reflected in a proposed local zoning ordinance, would require the acquisition, alteration, or removal of any land use, then, in such event, at least 60 days prior to the first hearing on adoption of the ordinance, the local zoning authority shall so notify the airport owner. The airport owner shall then consider the alternatives of closing a runway, runway realignment or relocation, runway extension or shortening, and displaced thresholds and shall then promptly notify the local zoning authority in writing, if it proposes to take any of such alternative actions.</p>
                  <p>(9) These rules shall be effective June 30, 1979, except as provided above as to isolated, low density residential building lots and low density residential structures.</p>

                <p>The transportation revolving loan fund (TRLF) is a state fund that can be used by eligible borrowers to finance approved transportation projects. The purpose of the TRLF is to attract new funding into transportation, encourage innovative approaches to financing transportation projects, and help build needed transportation infrastructure. The TRLF can provide loans and other types of financial assistance to eligible borrowers to finance transportation projects. When the loans are repaid, the funds are returned to the TRLF and used to finance another set of projects, creating a continually expanding pool of money for transportation projects.</p>
                <p>The TRLF is jointly administered by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Minnesota Public Facilities Authority. Minnesota Statutes, section 446A.085, authorizes the Minnesota Public Facilities Authority to manage and administer the fund and establishes the transportation committee of the Minnesota Public Facilities Authority to review and approve financial assistance to projects certified by the commissioner of transportation. Each project must be certified by the commissioner of transportation before its consideration by the transportation committee. Parts 8805.0050 to 8805.0700 establish procedures for and information that will be used to certify projects to the transportation committee of the Minnesota Public Facilities Authority. Parts 7380.0705 to 7380.0775 provide for the administration of the Minnesota Public Facilities Authority's responsibilities.</p>

                  <p>If at any time the state of Minnesota, acting through its commissioner of transportation, shall deem it necessary to make any improvements or changes on all or any part of the right-of-way of the trunk highway which affect a utility located on trunk highway right-of-way, then and in such event, the owner of the utility shall within 15 days after written notice from the commissioner of transportation or an authorized agent, proceed to alter, change, vacate, or remove said utility from the trunk highway right-of-way so as to conform to said trunk highway changes and as directed by the commissioner of transportation. Such work shall be done without any cost whatsoever to the state of Minnesota except as otherwise provided by law or agreement and shall be completed within the date specified in said written notice, which date shall be reasonable under the circumstances.

Notwithstanding the provisions of parts 8810.3100 to 8810.3600, the state may reimburse a municipality for the cost of the first relocation of a municipally owned utility located within the limits of a municipal street at the time that the street was taken over by the state as a trunk highway, when such relocation is required by construction or reconstruction of the trunk highway.</p>

                  <p>Utilities along the interstate highways shall be located outside the control-of-access lines except as outlined below. Where the control-of-access lines coincide with the right-of-way lines, the utilities shall generally be located on private property. Where the control-of-access lines and right-of-way lines do not coincide, utilities may in general be located in the area between them. All utilities shall be serviced and maintained without access from the ramps, loops, and through traffic roadbeds. Utilities may be serviced from frontage roads and roads other than another interstate highway which cross either over or under the interstate highway. At aerial crossings of an interstate highway, supporting poles may be located on interstate highway right-of-way if they are a minimum of 30 feet beyond the shoulders of all through traffic roadbeds; however, in no event shall they be located in a median unless its width is 80 feet or more. Manholes and other points of access to underground crossings may be permitted on the interstate highway right-of-way only when located outside the shoulders of the through traffic roadbeds, loops, or ramps. The restrictions of this subpart shall not apply to utility lines which service facilities required for operating the interstate highway.</p>
                  <p>There may be extreme cases where, under strictly controlled conditions, a utility may be permitted inside the control-of-access lines along an interstate highway. In each case there must be a showing that any other utility location is extremely difficult and unreasonably costly to the utility consumer, that the installation on the right-of-way of the interstate highway will not adversely affect the design, construction, stability, traffic safety, or operation of the interstate highway and that the utility can be serviced without access from through traffic roadbeds, loops, or ramps.</p>

                  <p>The following mailbox installations and supports are declared to be a public nuisance, a road hazard, and a danger to the health and safety of the traveling public if located along a street or highway having a speed limit of 40 miles per hour or greater:</p>
                  <p>A. an installation that contains more than one vertical support;</p>
                  <p>B. a single support containing more than two mailboxes;</p>
                  <p>C. a wooden support with a cross-sectional area greater than 16 square inches at any above-ground point along the support (for example, the maximum allowable square and round support dimensions are four inches by four inches and 4.5 inches in diameter, respectively), except that larger wooden supports are acceptable if, at a height four inches above the ground, the support cross-sectional area is altered in some fashion so as to reduce the cross-sectional area at that point to 16 square inches or less;</p>
                  <p>D. a metal support of a weight of four pounds per foot or more for any one foot of vertical measurement above ground (for example, a standard steel pipe of up to two inches inner diameter would be acceptable), except that larger metal supports are acceptable if, within the first three inches above ground the metal support is less than four pounds per foot (less than one pound for the three-inch length);</p>

                  <p>F. adjacent mailbox installations whose respective supports are spaced closer than 30 inches, as measured from center of support to center of support;</p>
                  <p>G. neighborhood delivery and collection box units, whether or not United States Postal Service approved;</p>
                  <p>H. a support comprised of material other than solely wood or metal that either exceeds 16 square inches in total cross-sectional area at a height four inches above ground or is of a weight of four pounds per foot or more for any one foot of vertical measurement above ground, unless within the first three inches above ground the support is less than four pounds per foot (less than one pound over the three-inch distance). Examples of such nonconforming supports could include supports such as filled milk cans, brick structures, plows, and concrete-filled pipe; and</p>
                  <p>I. an installation, whether a support or closed mailbox, that encroaches the usable roadway or its airspace.</p>

                  <p>Route designations for county state-aid highways (CSAH) and municipal state-aid streets (MSAS) must be selected by the respective boards of county commissioners or governing bodies of urban municipalities. The highway or street selections must be reviewed by the district state-aid engineer of that area and the engineer's recommendation must be filed with the commissioner. Upon preliminary approval of the commissioner, the respective boards or governing bodies shall establish the route by designation. For MSAS routes to be designated on county roadways, the designation must be approved in the form of a resolution by the county board and the resolution filed with the commissioner. After receipt of each board action requesting designation, the commissioner shall approve all or part of the highway or street designations that comply with the criteria set out in this chapter. The commissioner shall certify to the respective boards of county commissioners or governing bodies of urban municipalities the approved portion of the highway or street designation. Highways or streets so approved become a part of the CSAH system or the MSAS system, subject to additions or revisions as may be, from time to time, requested and approved.</p>

                <p>The commissioner must authorize the disaster board to inspect the disaster area if the requesting county or urban municipality damage estimate exceeds ten percent of the current road annual state-aid allotment to the county or urban municipality. The disaster board must consider the availability of any state and federal disaster relief funds before making its recommendation. A disaster appropriation approved by the commissioner must be promptly paid after a work plan for each project under this part is submitted, up to 95 percent of its estimate to the county or urban municipality for which the appropriation was authorized. The funds so allotted and paid to the county or urban municipality may only be spent for the purpose for which they were authorized, and within a reasonable time specified by the commissioner. Immediately upon completion of the work for which the disaster payment was made or the expiration of the time specified for doing the work, whichever occurs first, the county or urban municipality shall file a report certifying the extent of the authorized work completed and showing the total expenditure made. If the total disaster allotment was not required or used for the purpose specified or if state or federal disaster aid is later received, the remainder and an amount equal to the state or federal aid received must be promptly reimbursed to the commissioner for redeposit in the county state-aid disaster account or the municipal state-aid disaster account.</p>

                  <p>The town bridge account may be used to pay the cost to replace or reconstruct a town bridge, or to abandon an existing bridge that is deficient and in need of replacement but where no replacement will be made. It may also be used to pay the costs to construct a road or street to facilitate the abandonment of an existing bridge determined by the commissioner to be deficient if the commissioner determines that construction of the road or street is more cost efficient than replacing the existing bridge. A town bridge is eligible for replacement, reconstruction, or abandonment after the county board reviews the pertinent data supplied by local citizenry, local units of government, the regional development commission, or the metropolitan council, and adopts a formal resolution identifying the town bridge or bridges to be replaced or reconstructed. Except as otherwise provided by law, payment to the counties is limited to the cost of the bridge and must be made in accordance with part 8820.2300, subpart 7.</p>

                <p>Any person may make a written request to designate a county state-aid highway as a natural preservation route. The request must be directed to the county board having jurisdiction over the route. A county board is not required to propose designation for the entire length of a county state-aid highway. The county board shall act on the request within 60 days. In order to designate a county state-aid highway as a natural preservation route, the commissioner must receive a board resolution from the county having jurisdiction over the road.</p>
                <p>The county board shall use the descriptions in part 8820.4010 as a guide for determining which designation type best fits a particular route. All of the descriptors may be used in combination. No single descriptor, including ADT, may be used to eliminate a route type from consideration.</p>

                  <p>A type I natural preservation route is best characterized as one in which the natural surroundings convey a feeling of intimacy with nature. This type of route carries local passenger vehicles with occasional commercial vehicles. This route has very low volumes with leisurely driving speeds and may be used by pleasure drivers. The roadway alignment follows the terrain, which may be hilly or curving around lakes and wetlands, and can be described as lying lightly on the land. There are few reported accidents related to the geometric design of the roadway or accidents can be minimized without realignment. The operating speeds are generally lower than on regular county state-aid highway routes.</p>

                  <p>A type II natural preservation route creates a feeling similar to the feeling created by a type I natural preservation route, but the surroundings and vistas may be more distant from the roadway. It carries local traffic with moderate amounts of commercial vehicles. This route generally has low volumes but may have seasonal peaks greater than 300 vehicles per day. It has leisurely driving speeds and may be used by some commuters and pleasure drivers. The roadway alignment follows the terrain, which may be hilly or curving around lakes and wetlands. Some modifications may be made to the land surface. There are few reported accidents related to the geometric design of the roadway or accidents can be minimized with mitigation as referred to in part 8820.4060.

                  <p>A type III natural preservation route goes through an environment similar to the types I and II natural preservation routes, but the surroundings and vistas may be more distant from the roadway. It may function as a minor or major collector and may be used by general commercial traffic. It generally has volumes less than 750 vehicles per day but may have seasonal peaks. This type of roadway passes through diverse terrain features and the alignment is consistent with the traffic mix. It may have required some modifications to the land surface. The safety problems that may exist are related to the traffic volumes and to the geometric design of the roadway. The problems can be corrected with mitigation as referred to in part 8820.4060 or with reconstruction. The operating speeds may be lower than a comparable county state-aid highway route that is not on the natural preservation route system.</p>

                <p>A county proposing a project that requires removal of the entire surface of a county state-aid highway that is a natural preservation route shall send to owners of property abutting the highway a written notice that describes the project. In addition, the county shall hold a public meeting to discuss design and construction alternatives. Before project approval, the county highway engineer shall provide evidence to the state aid engineer that the concerns raised at the public meeting have been addressed or incorporated into the project. Spot maintenance projects, such as culvert replacements or subgrade corrections, do not require notice.</p>

                <p>A county board, after notice and a public hearing, may petition the commissioner by resolution to remove the natural preservation route designation if the board believes the characteristics on which the natural preservation route designation was approved have substantially been lost. The petition for removing the designation must be based on such items as loss of aesthetic qualities, changes in land use, changes in road function, or significant increases in accidents. After receipt of the county board resolution, the commissioner shall approve or deny the petition to remove the natural preservation route designation from the roadway. The commissioner shall base the decision on the criteria in part 8820.4040, subpart 2, notify the political subdivision in writing of the decision and include a written explanation with the notification.</p>

                <p>Engineering judgment should be used to choose a lane-width, on-road bicycle facility, or shoulder-width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart for roadways. Factors to consider include safety, speed, population/land use, benefit/cost analysis, traffic mix, peak hourly traffic, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, on-street parking, intersection and driveway spacing, rights-of-way constraints, vehicle turn lane configuration, sight distance, sight lines, bus routes, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Dimensions less than those indicated in the chart require a variance in accordance with parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                <p>For rural divided roadways, use the geometric design standards of the Mn/DOT Road Design Manual, with a minimum ten tons structural design and minimum 40 mph design speed.</p>
                <p>(a) Use the existing traffic for highways not on the state-aid system.</p>
                <p>(b) The state-aid engineer may approve lane widths of ten feet on roads classified as local or collector if truck and bus volumes are relatively low, rights-of-way are constrained, design speeds are 35 mph or less, and ADT is less than 1,500.</p>
                <p>(c) Applies to inslope within the clear zone only. Approach roadway sideslopes in the clear zone must be 1:4 or flatter. Mn/DOT Road Design Manual clear zone may be used.</p>
                <p>(d) Culverts with less than 30-inch vertical height allowed without protection in the clear zone. Mn/DOT Road Design Manual clear zone widths may be used in lieu of the values in the table in this part.</p>
                <p>Guardrail is required to be installed at all bridges where the design speed exceeds 40 mph, and either the existing ADT exceeds 400 or the bridge clear width is less than the sum of the lane and shoulder widths.</p>
                <p>Mailbox supports must be in accordance with chapter 8818.</p>
                <p>For roadways in suburban areas as defined in part 8820.0200, the clear zone may be reduced to a width of ten feet for projected ADT under 1,000 and to 20 feet for projected ADT of 1,000 or over. Wherever the legal posted speed limit is 45 mph or less, the clear zone may be reduced to a width of ten feet.</p>
                <p>(e) Subject to terrain. In suburban areas, the minimum design speed may be equal to the current legal posted speed where the legal posted speed is 30 mph or greater.</p>
                <p>(f) Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. A bridge narrower than these widths may remain in place if the bridge is not deficient structurally or hydraulically.</p>
                <p>(g) Shoulders are required to be a minimum width of eight feet for highways classified as minor arterials and principal arterials with greater than 1,500 ADT projected, at least two feet of which must be paved.</p>
                <p>(h) Except within municipal corporate limits, ten-ton staged structural design must be able to carry ten-ton axle loads except during spring load-restriction periods, or year-round if needed for system continuity. Roadbed width must accommodate ultimate ten-ton pavement overlay thickness and ultimate 1:4 sideslope. Within municipal corporate limits, minimum structural design must support nine-ton axle strength.</p>
                <p>HL-93 loading in the AASHTO LRFD (load and resistance factor design) Specifications is required for new or reconstructed bridges. Rehabilitated bridges must have a load rating factor of at least 0.9 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. The curb-to-curb minimum width for new or reconstructed bridges must be equal to the proposed lane plus shoulder widths, but in no case less than the minimum lane widths plus four feet, and in no case less than required per Minnesota Statutes, section 165.04.</p>

                <p>Engineering judgment may be used to choose a lane-width or shoulder-width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart for roadways. Factors to consider may be safety, speed, population, land use, benefit/cost analysis, traffic mix, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Widths less than those indicated in the chart require a variance in accordance with parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                <p>(a) For existing ADT greater than 400, part 8820.9920 standards apply.</p>
                <p>(b) The state-aid engineer may approve lane widths of ten feet on roads classified as local or collector where truck and bus volumes are relatively low, rights-of-way are constrained, design speeds are 35 miles per hour or less, and ADT is less than 1,500.</p>
                <p>(c) Applies to slope within the clear zone only.</p>
                <p>(d) Culverts with less than 30-inch vertical height allowed without protection in the clear zone. Mn/DOT Road Design Manual clear zone widths may be used in lieu of the values in the table in this part.</p>
                <p>(e) Subject to terrain.</p>
                <p>(f) Where two dimensions are shown, the larger values within the range are desirable.</p>
                <p>(g) For roadways in suburban areas, the clear zone may be reduced to a width of ten feet for projected ADT under 1,000 and to 20 feet for projected ADT of 1,000 or over. Wherever the legal posted speed limit is 45 miles per hour or less, the clear zone may be reduced to a width of ten feet.</p>
                <p>Bridges and approach roadways of minimum 20-foot clear width and 20-foot width to the outsides of the shoulders may be constructed where existing ADT is less than 50, potential for increasing ADT is low, and the local government agency finds that the bridge can operate effectively at that width for the expected life of the bridge.</p>
                <p>HL-93 loading in the AASHTO LRFD (load and resistance factor design) Specifications is required for new or reconstructed bridges. Rehabilitated bridges must have a load rating factor of at least 0.9 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. The curb-to-curb minimum width for new or reconstructed bridges must be equal to the proposed lane plus shoulder widths, but in no case less than (1) the minimum lane width plus four feet, and (2) the width required under Minnesota Statutes, section 165.04.</p>

                  <p>When the road authority has determined that the roadway will be specifically designed to include on-road bicycle facilities, and only if the roadway surface is paved, the appropriate design criteria in the current MnDOT Bikeway Facility Design Manual are recommended for design purposes.</p>
                  <p>Engineering judgment should be used to choose a lane-width, on-road bicycle facility, or shoulder width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart. Factors to consider include safety, speed, population/land use, benefit/cost analysis, traffic mix, peak hourly traffic, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, on-street parking, intersection and driveway spacing, rights-of-way constraints, vehicle turn lane configuration, sight distance, sight lines, bus routes, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Dimensions less than those indicated in the chart require a variance in accordance with parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                  <p>Widths of bridges to remain in place must equal roadway pavement width. Bridges narrower than these widths may remain in place provided that the bridge does not qualify for federal-aid bridge funds. Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level.</p>
                  <p>Any highway that was previously built to state-aid or state standards, that was granted a variance to standards in effect at the time of construction or reconstruction, or that is a trunk highway turnback, may be reconditioned.</p>
                  <p>The proposed structural design strength must accommodate a minimum of seven tons per axle.</p>

                <p>Engineering judgment may be used to choose a lane-width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart for roadways. Factors to consider include safety, speed, population/land use, benefit/cost analysis, traffic mix, peak hourly traffic, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Widths less than those indicated in the chart require a variance in accordance with parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                <p>(a) Twelve feet should be considered in industrial areas. One-way turn lanes must be at least ten feet wide, except 11 feet is required if the design speed is 50 mph or higher.</p>
                <p>(b) Ten feet may be considered where truck or bus volumes are relatively low, rights-of-way are constrained, and design speeds are 35 mph or less. Eleven feet minimum is required on four-lane, undivided facilities.</p>
                <p>(c) Curb reaction must be provided only where parking is not provided.</p>
                <p>(d) The state-aid engineer may approve a zero-foot curb reaction distance where the cross-section is constrained, appropriate curb types are used, and drainage collection is adequate. The curb must be constructed without a gutter or monolithically with the adjacent traveled way.</p>
                <p>(e) The roadway ADT and the vehicle mix must be considered when determining parking lane width. In commercial or industrial areas, the minimum parking lane width is eight feet.</p>
                <p>One-way streets must have at least two through-traffic lanes.</p>
                <p>When a median is included in the design of the two-way roadway, a one-foot minimum curb reaction distance to the median is required on either side of the median. Minimum median width is four feet.</p>
                <p>Urban design roadways must be a minimum nine tons structural axle load design.</p>
                <p>Roadways not on the state-aid system are not subject to the minimum structural design strength requirements.</p>
                <p>The minimum curb-to-curb width of a new bridge must be the required street width, but in no case less than required per Minnesota Statutes, section 165.04. HL-93 loading in the AASHTO LRFD (load and resistance factor design) Specifications is required for new or reconstructed bridges. Rehabilitated bridges must have a load rating factor of at least 0.9 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. Where the new bridge approach roadway includes elements for the accommodation of pedestrians or bicycles, the new bridge width must also provide for pedestrians or bicycles unless pedestrians or bicycles are otherwise accommodated.</p>
                <p>For ADT less than 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes. For ADT greater than or equal to 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes plus half the sum of the shoulders, parking lane, and curb reaction distance. Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level.</p>
                <p>Clearance of 1.5 feet from the face of the curb to fixed objects must be provided when the design speed is 40 to 45 mph. A ten-foot clear zone measured from the driving lane must be provided when the design speed is 50 mph or higher.</p>
                <p>Unless four lanes are provided, an engineering traffic study is required for traffic volumes greater than 15,000 projected ADT to determine lane configuration and lane use.</p>

                <p>Engineering judgment should be used to choose a lane-width, on-road bicycle facility, or shoulder width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart. Factors to consider include safety, speed, population/land use, benefit/cost analysis, traffic mix, peak hourly traffic, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, on-street parking, intersection and driveway spacing, rights-of-way constraints, vehicle turn lane configuration, sight distance, sight lines, bus routes, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Dimensions less than those indicated in the chart require a variance in accordance with parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                <p>(a) Twelve feet should be considered in industrial areas. Eleven feet minimum is required on four-lane, undivided facilities. One-way turn lanes must be at least ten feet wide, except 11 feet is required if the design speed is 50 mph or over.</p>
                <p>(b) A combination of all minimum widths for the driving lane, on-road bicycle lane, and parking lane is only permissible with a variance. Ten feet may be considered where truck and bus volumes are relatively low, rights-of-way are constrained, and design speeds are 35 mph or less.</p>
                <p>(c) Curb reaction shall be provided unless on-street parking, a bicycle facility, or a wide outside lane are provided adjacent to the curb.</p>
                <p>(d) The state-aid engineer may approve a zero-foot curb reaction distance where the cross-section is constrained, appropriate curb types are used, and drainage collection is adequate. The curb must be constructed without a gutter or monolithically with the adjacent traveled way.</p>
                <p>(e) In determining the parking lane width, the roadway ADT and the vehicle mix shall be taken into consideration. In commercial or industrial areas, the minimum parking lane width is eight feet.</p>
                <p>One-way streets must have at least two through-traffic lanes.</p>
                <p>When a raised median is included in the design of the two-way roadway, a one-foot minimum curb reaction distance to the median is required on either side of the median. Minimum median width is four feet.</p>
                <p>Urban design roadways must accommodate a minimum nine tons structural axle load design.</p>
                <p>Roadways not on the state-aid system are not subject to the minimum structural design strength requirements.</p>
                <p>The minimum curb-to-curb width of a new bridge must be the required street width, but in no case less than required per Minnesota Statutes, section 165.04. HL-93 loading in the AASHTO LRFD (load and resistance factor design) Specifications is required for new or reconstructed bridges. Rehabilitated bridges must have a load rating factor of at least 0.9 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. When the new bridge approach roadway includes elements for the accommodation of pedestrians or bicycles, the new bridge width must also provide for pedestrians or bicycles unless pedestrians or bicycles are otherwise accommodated.</p>
                <p>For ADT less than 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes. For ADT greater than or equal to 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes plus one-half the sum of the shoulders, parking lane, and curb reaction distance. Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level.</p>
                <p>Clearance of 1.5 feet from the face of the curb to fixed objects must be provided when the posted speed is 40 to 45 mph. A ten foot clear zone measured from the driving lane must be provided when the posted speed is 50 mph or over.</p>

                  <p>Engineering judgment may be used to choose a lane-width or shoulder-width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart for roadways. Factors to consider include safety, speed, population/land use, benefit/cost analysis, traffic mix, peak hourly traffic, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Widths less than those indicated in the chart require a variance in accordance with parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                  <p>(a) Permissible for present traffic volumes less than 15,000 ADT.</p>
                  <p>(b) When ADT is less than 5,000, seven tons is allowable.</p>
                  <p>(c) No parking is allowed.</p>
                  <p>When a median is included in the design of the two-way roadway, a one-foot reaction distance to the median is required on either side of the median. Minimum median width is four feet.</p>
                  <p>For ADT less than 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes. For ADT greater than or equal to 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes plus half the sum of the shoulders, parking lane, and curb reaction distance. Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level.</p>

                <p>Engineering judgment should be used to choose a lane-width, on-road bicycle facility, or shoulder width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart. Factors to consider include safety, speed, population/land use, benefit/cost analysis, traffic mix, peak hourly traffic, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, on-street parking, intersection and driveway spacing, rights-of-way constraints, vehicle turn lane configuration, sight distance, sight lines, bus routes, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Dimensions less than those indicated in the chart require a variance in accordance with parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                <p>(a) Eleven feet minimum is required on four-lane, undivided facilities. Twelve feet should be considered in industrial areas.</p>
                <p>(b) Ten feet may be considered where truck and bus volumes are relatively low, rights-of-way are constrained, and design speeds are 35 mph or less.</p>
                <p>(c) A combination of all minimum widths for the driving lane, on-road bicycle lane, and parking lane is only permissible with a variance.</p>
                <p>(d) In determining the parking lane width, the roadway ADT and the vehicle mix shall be taken into consideration. In commercial or industrial areas, the minimum parking lane width is eight feet.</p>
                <p>(e) When ADT is less than 5,000, seven-ton axle load structural design strength is permissible.</p>
                <p>A minimum curb reaction of one foot shall be provided unless on-street parking, a bicycle facility, or a wide outside lane are provided adjacent to the curb. The dimensions for wide outside lanes include the curb reaction distance. When a raised median is included in the design of the two-way roadway, a one-foot minimum curb reaction distance to the median is required on either side of the median. Minimum median width is four feet.</p>
                <p>For ADT less than 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes. For ADT greater than or equal to 150, the widths of bridges to remain must be at least the sum of the lanes plus one-half the sum of the shoulders, parking lane, and curb reaction distance. Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level.</p>

                  <p>Engineering judgment may be used to choose a lane-width or shoulder-width dimension other than the widths indicated in the chart for roadways. Factors to consider include safety, speed, population, land use, benefit-cost analysis, traffic mix, peak hourly traffic, farm equipment, environmental impacts, terrain limitations, bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, other nonmotorized uses, functional classification, or other factors. Widths less than those indicated in the chart require a variance under parts 8820.3300 and 8820.3400.</p>
                  <p>(a) If the route has scenic vistas that will require parking vehicles along the shoulder, widening the shoulder at these locations is acceptable. The designer will provide a four-foot paved shoulder if the route is a popular bicycle route.</p>
                  <p>(b) Applies to slope within the clear zone only. Other design features, such as guardrails or retaining walls, should be considered in particularly sensitive areas in lieu of reconstructing the inslope in accordance with part 8820.4060.</p>
                  <p>(c) Guardrail is required to be installed at all bridges where the design speed exceeds 40 mph, and either the existing ADT exceeds 400 or the bridge width is less than the sum of the lane and shoulder widths.</p>
                  <p>Mailbox supports must be in accordance with chapter 8818.</p>
                  <p>(d) Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. A bridge narrower than these widths may remain in place if the bridge is not deficient structurally or hydraulically.</p>
                  <p>HL-93 loading in the AASHTO LRFD (load and resistance factor design) Specifications is required for new or reconstructed bridges. Rehabilitated bridges must have a load rating factor of at least 0.9 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. The curb-to-curb minimum width for new or reconstructed bridges is the sum of the lane and shoulder widths plus four feet.</p>
                  <p>Ditch depths and widths must be kept to the minimum required to function hydraulically and to provide for adequate snow storage when a standard ditch would negatively impact the surroundings.</p>
                  <p>The designer shall specify in the plan and special provisions that the clearing width is to be kept to the absolute minimum. In sensitive areas, the normal clearance allowed to a contractor for working room is zero unless otherwise required for special conditions.</p>
                  <p>Curb and gutter may be used in lieu of a ditch section under the paved option. The lane width, shoulder width, and clear zone must be maintained.</p>
                  <p>For designated national forest highways within national forests, and state park access roads within state parks, this subpart applies only where the projected ADT is less than 100, unless the route has been designated as a natural preservation route.</p>
                  <p>For roundabout design, the design criteria of the current edition of the Minnesota State Aid Roundabout Guide are recommended.</p>

                  <p>(a) The designer will provide a six-foot paved shoulder if the route is a popular bicycle route. If the route has scenic vistas that will require parking vehicles along the shoulder, widening the shoulder at these locations is acceptable.</p>
                  <p>(b) Applies to slope within clear zone only. Other design features, such as guardrail or retaining walls, should be considered in particularly sensitive areas in lieu of reconstructing the inslope in accordance with part 8820.4060. Approach sideslopes must be 1:4 or flatter within the clear zone when the ADT exceeds 400.</p>
                  <p>(c) Guardrail is required to be installed at all bridges where the design speed exceeds 40 mph, and either the existing ADT exceeds 400 or the bridge width is less than the sum of the lane and shoulder widths.</p>
                  <p>Mailbox supports must be in accordance with chapter 8818.</p>
                  <p>(d) Bridges to remain must have a load rating factor of at least 0.75 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. A bridge narrower than these widths may remain in place if the bridge does not qualify for federal-aid bridge funds.</p>
                  <p>(e) A 30 mph design speed may be applied only when the project is located in a suburban area.</p>
                  <p>HL-93 loading in the AASHTO LRFD (load and resistance factor design) Specifications is required for new or reconstructed bridges. Rehabilitated bridges must have a load rating factor of at least 0.9 using the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation, LRFR (load and resistance factor rating) for inventory level. The curb-to-curb minimum width for new or reconstructed bridges is the sum of the lane and shoulder widths, but may not be less than 30 feet.</p>
                  <p>Ditch depths and widths must be kept to the minimum required to function hydraulically, to be traversable if within the clear zone, and to provide for adequate snow storage when a standard ditch would negatively impact the surroundings.</p>
                  <p>The designer shall specify in the plan and special provisions that the clearing width is to be kept to the absolute minimum. In sensitive areas, the normal clearance allowed to a contractor for working room is zero unless required for special conditions.</p>
                  <p>For designated national forest highways within national forests, and state park access roads within state parks, this subpart may be applied only where the projected ADT is less than 300, unless the route has been designated as a natural preservation route.</p>
                  <p>For roundabout design, the design criteria of the current edition of the Minnesota State Aid Roundabout Guide are recommended.</p>

                <p>(a) Ten feet is desired for a shared use path. Five feet is required for a one-way shared use path.</p>
                <p>(b) For vehicular roadway bridges or underpasses accommodating an off-road bicycle path or shared use path, the total width (minimum surface width plus shoulder/clear zone) is eight feet minimum, with ten feet being desirable. However, whenever practicable, the shoulder/clear zone of an off-road bike or shared use path should be carried across or under a vehicular bridge. When the clear zone of an off-road bike or shared use path cannot practicably be carried across or under the bridge, a lead-in guardrail must be provided, unless the surface width of the approach path is narrowed at a maximum 1:50 taper while providing the minimum travel lane and shoulder/clear zone widths through the structure.</p>
                <p>For a separate off-road bicycle path or shared use path, the shoulder/clear zone must be carried across bridge or underpass structures. Minimum structure clear width must be 12 feet. When the surface width plus shoulder/clear zone width of the approaching off-road bike or shared use path is greater than the proposed clear width of the structure, then a lead-in bicycle safety railing is required, unless the surface width of the approach path is narrowed at a maximum 1:50 taper while providing the minimum travel lane and shoulder/clear zone widths through the structure.</p>
                <p>(c) Clear zone is measured from the edge of the travel lane.</p>
                <p>(d) Use a 30 mph design speed for grades longer than 500 feet and greater than four percent, from the uphill point where the grade equals four percent to 500 feet beyond the downhill point where the grade becomes less than four percent. The maximum allowable grade is 8.3 percent.</p>
                <p>(e) When an off-road bicycle or shared use path continues through a box culvert structure, up to three inches of bituminous surfacing may be used through the structure. The minimum vertical clearance for box culvert structures is nine feet, nine inches, or seven feet, nine inches if passage of emergency or maintenance vehicles is not necessary.</p>

Visibility obstructions must be removed according to the following:</p>
                  <p>A. For a grade crossing or private crossing with active warning devices and gates, the road authority or private crossing owner shall clear visibility obstructions so that all railroad advance warning signs are clearly visible from the roadway and the active warning devices are visible to a driver that is approaching the crossing at a distance from the crossing in which the vehicle can safely be brought to a stop before reaching the crossing. The rail carrier shall not park rail equipment on the portion of the track that would activate the active warning devices.</p>
                  <p>B. For a grade crossing or private crossing with only active warning devices or stop signs, the road authority or private crossing owner shall clear visibility obstructions as described in item A. The rail carrier and road authority or private crossing owner shall clear their respective rights-of-way within the stopped vehicle sight triangle as determined by the AASHTO design manual for a train traveling at the highest allowable speed at the crossing. The rail carrier shall not park rail equipment on the portion of the track that would activate the active warning devices.</p>
                  <p>C. For a grade crossing with crossbucks only, the road authority shall clear visibility obstructions as described in item A, and clear remaining right-of-way that is within the moving vehicle sight triangle as determined by the AASHTO design manual for trains and vehicles traveling at their highest allowable speed at the crossing. The rail carrier shall also clear its right-of-way that lies within the determined sight triangle. The sight triangle may contain property other than that belonging to the road authority and the rail carrier. This property must be cleared by the property owner in order to provide an adequate view of oncoming trains.</p>

                  <p>If visibility standards cannot be achieved for a crossing with its existing warning system, a different warning system may be substituted if the visibility standards for the crossing can be met in such a way as to preserve safety. For example, if the visibility standards for a crossing with crossbucks cannot be achieved, adequate visibility may be achieved with an addition of a stop sign, an active warning device, or an active warning device with a gate. Other alternatives include, but are not limited to, lowering the vehicle speed, the train speed, or both; using a flagger; or closing the crossing and redirecting the traffic to another crossing.</p>

                  <p>Mn/DOT has adopted supplementary railroad advance-warning signs numbered W10-X1, W10-X2, W10-X3, and W13-1, as described in this part. These signs are intended for use in advance of grade crossings where neither active warning devices nor stop signs have been installed and where conditions indicate the need for additional advance warning supplementing that provided by the W10-1 circular railroad advance-warning sign. The use of these signs must be based on investigation by the road authority or the commissioner of conditions at the grade crossing, such as train and vehicle speeds, sight distractions or obstructions, stopping distances, and similar criteria.</p>
                  <p>The installation, maintenance, and costs of supplementary railroad advance-warning signs are responsibilities of the road authority.</p>

                  <p>Supplementary advance-warning signs alert motorists as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. The track-angle sign, numbered W10-X1 and shown in part 8830.9931, subpart 1, shows that the track crosses the roadway at a skew, and alerts the motorist that extra care may be needed to ascertain whether trains are approaching. It must display a track symbol at 45 degrees left or right, depending if it's a left skew or right skew.</p>
                  <p>B. The blind-crossing sign, numbered W10-X2 and shown in part 8830.9931, subpart 2, warns of sight obstructions at the grade crossing area and calls for added vigilance on the part of the motorist.</p>
                  <p>C. The look for trains sign, numbered W10-X3 and shown in part 8830.9931, subpart 3, may follow the blind-crossing sign or other advance-warning sign for additional emphasis by providing a reminder that it is the motorist's obligation to ascertain whether or not it is safe to proceed over the grade crossing.</p>
                  <p>D. Advisory speed plates, numbered W13-1, may be mounted beneath a railroad advance-warning sign to indicate the safe vehicle-approach speed to the grade crossing.</p>

The road authority shall install an exempt-crossing sign below the railroad advance-warning sign. The rail carrier shall install an exempt-crossing sign below the crossbuck and track signs.</p>

                  <p>Active warning devices are used to advise motorists of the approach or presence of trains. At a grade crossing where the commissioner concludes that active warning devices are needed in addition to that provided by signs, the commissioner shall determine which devices are appropriate for the grade crossing. In determining which devices are appropriate for the grade crossing, the commissioner shall consider the type of roadway, volume of trains and vehicles per day, and visibility standards. These active warning devices must comply with part 8830.9901, subparts 3, 4, and 5, and be approved under part 8830.2125.</p>

                  <p>When a grade crossing with an active warning device is within or near a roadway intersection controlled by a traffic signal, the control of the traffic signal must be preempted by the control of the active warning device upon the approach of trains to avoid conflicting aspects of the traffic signal and the active warning device. This preemption feature must establish and maintain the preempted condition while the active warning device is operating. The interconnection must be made to the traffic signals within 200 feet (61 meters) of the crossing.</p>
                  <p>At grade crossings where train movements are regulated or limited to the extent that active warning devices are not required, preemption of the adjacent signalized roadway intersections may still be desirable to permit nonconflicting roadway traffic to proceed during the time the grade crossing is blocked by a train. The responsible road authority shall determine which traffic signals will be preempted.</p>

                  <p>When the preemption sequence begins, it must at once bring into effect a traffic signal display that will permit all vehicles to clear the tracks before the train reaches the grade crossing.</p>
                  <p>When the green light is preempted by train operation, a yellow change interval must be inserted in the traffic signal sequence for safety and consistency. The traffic signal must indicate a green light in order to clear traffic off the tracks and give a red light to stop traffic approaching the tracks. After the traffic clears the tracks, the traffic signal may be operated to permit vehicle movements that do not cross the tracks, but must prohibit movements over the tracks.</p>
                  <p>When the train clears the grade crossing, the traffic signal must return to its designated phase.</p>

                  <p>Where feasible, the location and the phasing and timing of traffic signals near grade crossings must be designed so that vehicles are not required to stop on the tracks, even if this increases the waiting time. The exact nature of the display and the location of the traffic signals to accomplish this will depend on the physical relationship of the tracks to the roadway intersection area.</p>

                  <p>A. For rail rehabilitation on a rail line not owned by a regional railroad authority, the division of costs must comply with the following formula:</p>
                  <p>(1) The commissioner shall make a grant or loan of federal funds; a loan of state funds; or combination grant or loan of federal funds and loan of state funds, of up to 70 percent of the total cost of a project. A grant must not exceed 50 percent of the project cost.</p>
                  <p>(2) Rail users shall loan the rail carrier a minimum of ten percent of the cost of a project.</p>
                  <p>(3) The rail carrier shall provide a minimum of 20 percent of the cost of a project, and shall repay the loans from the rail users and the loans of federal and state funds.</p>
                  <p>B. If a rehabilitation project is on a rail line owned by a Regional Railroad Authority, the division of costs must comply with the following formula:</p>
                  <p>(1) The commissioner shall make a grant or loan of federal funds; a loan of state funds; or combination grant or loan of federal funds and loan of state funds, of up to 80 percent of the total cost of a project.</p>
                  <p>(2) Rail users shall loan the Regional Railroad Authority a minimum of ten percent of the total cost of a project.</p>
                  <p>(3) The Regional Railroad Authority shall provide a minimum of ten percent of the total cost of the project and shall repay the loans from the rail users and the loans of federal and state funds.</p>
                  <p>C. Participation in a contract by a party may include in-kind participation if agreed to by all parties to the contract. A detailed description and fair market value of all in-kind participation must be clearly defined in the contract.</p>

                  <p>The financial records of the recipient must be audited. They may be audited by the department or the department may accept all or part of the audit of an independent auditor instead of a departmental audit if the audit meets department standards. In addition to chapter 8835, department audits must be based on the contract cost principles and procedures in Code of Federal Regulations, title 48, chapter 1, part 31, and Office of Management and Budget Circular, Number A-87 and Number A-122, as amended. The financial records of a subcontractor may be audited at the department's discretion. The department shall submit year-end financial statements to the department auditor by April 15 of the year following the period covered by the financial assistance contract. Audits at the end of a contract period must establish approved total operating costs. New recipients are subject to a preaward audit before contract execution and fund encumbrance. As provided by Minnesota Statutes, section 16C.05, subdivision 5, the records, books, documents, and accounting practices of the recipient and of any third party contractor relating to the contract are subject to audit and examination by the department and the legislative auditor during working hours. If the department determines it has overpaid a recipient on a previous contract, the department may reduce payments under the current contract by the amount of overpayment.</p>

Public transit policy decisions made by the recipient and actions taken during the contract period must conform with the management plan. A proposed deviation from the management plan must be reported to the department and approval secured in writing before implementation. Approval will be granted if it is clearly documented that the proposed deviation will not increase overall project costs. Failure to secure approval jeopardizes continued financial assistance.</p>

In this subpart, "operate" includes towing the vehicle, except that vehicles marked out of service may be towed away by means of a vehicle using a crane or hoist. A vehicle combination consisting of the emergency towing vehicle and the out-of-service vehicle must not be operated unless the combination meets the performance requirements of this chapter except for those conditions noted on the driver, vehicle, and equipment compliance checklist.</p>

A copy of the waiver must be given to the limousine operator who employs the driver. The commissioner may revoke a waiver only after the person to whom it was granted is given notice of the proposed revocation and has been allowed an opportunity for hearing under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14. Falsifying information in the waiver application, information in the renewal application, or information required by a medical evaluation, by either the applicant or limousine operator, is prohibited.</p>

                  <p>If the railroad interest receives a bona fide offer for a parcel, it shall notify all leaseholders affected of the amount of the bona fide offer and of the parcel for which a bona fide offer exists. In addition, the notice must contain the following statement: "You have a right of first refusal to purchase the subject property under Minnesota Statutes, sections 222.631 to 222.633.

The challenge must be served in writing on the commissioner within 15 days. A copy must be served on the railroad interest. The railroad interest shall then immediately serve upon the commissioner a copy of the bona fide offer. The contents of a bona fide offer must be treated as trade secret information under Minnesota Statutes, section 13.37, upon the filing by the data suppliers of the request accompanied by supporting affidavits.</p>

                  <p>If there is a challenge, the commissioner will, within 60 days of the original notice by the commissioner or railroad interest, issue an order approving or rejecting the railroad interest's packaging of the parcel or bona fide offer, or both. The commissioner shall establish whether the bona fide offer is legitimate based on the following criteria: (1) offer is made by an independent third party, and (2) offeror has entered into a binding agreement with the railroad interest. The commissioner may engage, at the expense of the leaseholder, an appraiser to evaluate the reasonableness of the packaging of the parcel. The commissioner or the commissioner's designated appraiser may interview the railroad interest officials and examine their supporting documents in preparing the review. The commissioner may require the railroad interest to certify that the offer is an independent third party having no affiliation with the railroad interest. The appraiser shall make a recommendation to the commissioner who will issue an order upon review of the recommendation. The criteria for establishing the reasonableness of the parcel shall include:</p>
                  <p>A. whether the leasehold can be separated out of the parcel without reducing or inhibiting the railroad interest's ability to receive fair market value for its holdings; and</p>
                  <p>B. whether a bona fide offer can still be achieved even with the removal of the leasehold from the parcel.</p>

                  <p>A leaseholder has 90 days to negotiate with the railroad and complete the acquisition of the parcel after the ruling by the commissioner on any challenges.</p>
                  <p>In the case of an offer to sell when a bona fide offer has not been received, the leaseholder may elect within the first 30 days to secure and submit an independent appraisal to the commissioner and the railroad interest. The railroad interest shall then have 30 days to accept the counter offer of the leaseholder, negotiate an agreement with the leaseholder, or to secure its own independent appraisal which it shall then submit to the leaseholder and the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>If each of the two appraisals submitted to the commissioner is within five percent of their average, the price established by the commissioner must be the average of the two appraisals. If the variance is greater than five percent of the average price, either the leaseholder or the railroad interest may request the commissioner to choose a third appraiser, the costs of which must be split equally between the leaseholder and the railroad interest. The third appraiser shall report within 30 days to the commissioner, railroad interest, and leaseholder. If an agreement cannot be reached by the 90th day of the negotiation period, a notice of dispute may be filed with the commissioner. Within 30 days after filing of the notice of dispute, the commissioner shall issue an order establishing the purchase price.</p>
