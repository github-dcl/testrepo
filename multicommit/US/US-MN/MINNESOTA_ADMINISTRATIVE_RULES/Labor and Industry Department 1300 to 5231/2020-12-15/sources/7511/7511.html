      <p class="bl"><b>910.5 Calculated engineering design of mechanical smoke exhaust.</b> Calculated engineering design of mechanical smoke exhaust shall be in accordance with Sections 910.5.1 through 910.5.5.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>910.5.1 Methodology.</b> Mechanical smoke exhaust systems shall be designed to remove smoke after a fire is extinguished and to assist the fire department during suppression operations or during marginal sprinkler control situations. They are not considered life safety systems and are not designed for occupant safety.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>910.5.2 Calculation method.</b> Volumetric flow rate calculations shall demonstrate that the system will provide at least three air changes per hour for the space required to be provided with smoke exhaust. When only a portion of a space is used for high-piled storage requiring smoke exhaust, the volume to be extracted shall be based on the ceiling height multiplied by the actual gross floor area for storage.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>910.5.3 Operation.</b> Mechanical smoke exhaust fans shall be manually activated. In addition, individual manual controls of each fan unit shall also be provided.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>910.5.4 Supply air.</b> Supply air for exhaust fans shall be sized to provide a minimum of 50 percent of the required exhaust. Air velocity at each supply air opening shall not exceed an average of 200 feet per minute when measured 4 feet (1,219 mm) in front of the opening. Openings for supply air shall be uniformly distributed around the periphery of the area served and be located or ducted to a position not more than one-half the storage height above the floor. Supply air openings shall open automatically upon operation of the smoke exhaust system and shall not require a manual action at each supply opening for operation. Supply air openings shall be kept clear of storage or obstructions to airflow for at least 4 feet (1,219 mm) in front of the opening. Supply air openings shall be separated from exhaust fans and exterior combustibles to prevent introduction of smoke into the building.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>910.5.5 Equipment.</b> Wiring and controls shall be as required in Sections 910.4.5 and 910.4.6. Interlock controls shall be as required in Section 910.4.7. Exhaust fans shall be uniformly spaced and each fan shall have a maximum individual capacity of 30,000 cfm (850 m<sup>3</sup>/min).</p>

      <p class="bi">These qualifications shall not be required where demonstration of adequate skills and experience satisfactory to the fire code official is provided.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>P105.3 Acceptance test procedure.</b> When an emergency responder radio coverage system is required, and upon completion of installation, the building owner shall have the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 95 percent. The test procedure shall be conducted as follows:</p>
      <p class="bi2">1. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of 20 approximately equal test areas.</p>
      <p class="bi2">2. The test shall be conducted using a calibrated handheld or hip-worn device of the latest brand and model used by the agency talking through the agency's radio communications system.</p>
      <p class="bi2">3. Failure of a maximum of two nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test.</p>
      <p class="bi2">4. In the event that three of the test areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor shall be permitted to be divided into 40 equal test areas. Failure of a maximum of four nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. If the system fails the 40-area test, the system shall be altered to meet the 95 percent coverage requirement.</p>
      <p class="bi2">5. A test location approximately in the center of each test area shall be selected for the test, with the radio enabled to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the public agency's radio communications system. Once the test location has been selected, that location shall represent the entire test area. Failure in the selected test location shall be considered failure of that test area. Additional test locations shall not be permitted.</p>
      <p class="bi2">6. The gain values of all amplifiers, if applicable, shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.</p>
      <p class="bi2">7. As part of the installation, a spectrum analyzer or other suitable test equipment shall be utilized to ensure spurious oscillations are not being generated by the subject in-building coverage system. This test shall be conducted at time of installation and subsequent annual inspections.</p>
      <p class="bi2">8. A test shall be considered a "failure" when a transmission from the test device within the building fails to deliver intelligible audio or data to the appropriate public safety dispatch center or equivalent as would be expected during normal operation; and/or when a transmission from a public safety dispatch center or equivalent fails to deliver intelligible audio or data to the test device within the building as would be expected during normal operation.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>P105.5 FCC compliance.</b> The emergency responder radio coverage system installation and components shall also comply with all applicable federal regulations including FCC 47 CFR Part 90.219.</p>
      <p class="bl"><b>P106 Maintenance.</b> The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be maintained operational at all times in accordance with Sections P106.1 through P106.4.</p>
      <p class="bi"><b>P106.1 Testing and proof of compliance.</b> The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be inspected and tested annually or whenever structural changes occur including additions or remodels that could materially change the original field performance tests. Testing shall consist of the following:</p>
      <p class="bi2">1. In-building coverage test as described in Section P105.3.</p>
      <p class="bi2">2. Signal boosters in-building coverage systems shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance.</p>
      <p class="bi2">3. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage.
