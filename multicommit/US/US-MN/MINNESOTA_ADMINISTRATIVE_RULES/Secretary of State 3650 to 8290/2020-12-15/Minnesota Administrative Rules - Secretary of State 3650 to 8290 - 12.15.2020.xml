                  <p>A. Before the expiration of an organization's current registration period, the organization must renew its registration for a one year term by completing the registration form if the organization wishes to maintain its registration in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>B. The secretary must mail a renewal form to the responsible officer at the responsible officer's address 45 days before the expiration of the registration.</p>

                  <p>D. An application for renewal must be filed by the end of the organization's current registration period. The secretary shall not grant an extension to file a registration renewal to an organization.

If the student has already arrived in Minnesota, the organization must make arrangements to support the student's experience in a manner consistent with the requirements of this chapter and Minnesota Statutes, chapter 5A.</p>

                  <p>A. If an applicant submits a voter registration application that is incomplete as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 201.061, subdivision 1a, the auditor shall send a notice of incomplete registration. The notice sent to the applicant must:</p>

                  <p>(2) inform the applicant that to complete the registration, the applicant must present documents or take actions prior to voting;</p>
                  <p>(3) explain the applicant's options for completing the registration prior to 20 days before the election or at the polls on election day as set forth in Minnesota Statutes, section 201.061, subdivision 1a;</p>

                  <p>B. If an applicant submits a voter registration application that is incomplete as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 201.121, subdivision 1, paragraph (f), the auditor shall record in the voter registration system that the registration is incomplete under that section and send the applicant a notice of incomplete registration advising the voter that the voter needs to:</p>
                  <p>(1) provide information that completes the registration to the registration office or contact that office prior to 20 days before the election; or</p>
                  <p>(2) provide the information to the election judges on election day for entry on the roster.</p>
                  <p>The secretary of state shall provide a sample notice of incomplete registration. The applicant must be allowed to vote only after completing the registration or after registering or updating their registration using current information for the applicant.</p>
                  <p>After an election, the auditor shall compile a list of voters who voted who were not verified by election day. The auditor shall verify the records in the manner described in part 8200.5500 for registrations received on election day.</p>
                  <p>If a voter provides the necessary information and votes without updating their registration or registering on election day to correct information listed on the roster, the county auditor shall send that person a postal verification card as if the voter had registered on election day.</p>
                  <p>If that postal verification card is returned to the county auditor, the auditor shall challenge the status on the voter record and may refer the registration to the county attorney.</p>

                  <p>(b) date of birth;</p>
                  <p>(c) Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota state identification card number; or</p>
                  <p>(d) last four digits of Social Security number, if the applicant has not been issued a Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota state identification card.</p>
                  <p>If a voter has not been issued a Minnesota driver's license, a Minnesota state identification card, or a Social Security number, and the voter has so indicated on the voter's voter registration application, units (c) and (d) are inapplicable and the registration is verified; or</p>
                  <p>(2) that if after matching the information listed in subitem (1), even though the information may not be an exact match, the county auditor can still reasonably conclude that the information in the database of the Department of Public Safety, or in the database of the Social Security Administration if the applicant has no driver's license or identification card, and the information provided by the applicant on the voter registration application, relate to the same person, in which case the county auditor shall note in the statewide registration system the basis for the conclusion.</p>
                  <p>B. The secretary of state must attempt to verify information entered into the voter registration system as a result of new voter registration applications by comparing the information stored by the voter registration system with information contained in the database maintained by the Department of Public Safety. The secretary of state must provide reports on attempted verifications that show the information of record in each database and that list:</p>
                  <p>(1) voter registration applications that match the information in the Department of Public Safety database or, in the case of an applicant who does not have a Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota identification card in the database of the Social Security Administration, and that are therefore verified;</p>
                  <p>(2) voter registration applications that cannot be verified with certainty against the information in the Department of Public Safety database or, in the case of an applicant who does not have a Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota identification card, in the database of the Social Security Administration. The report must match and contrast the information contained in the several databases; and</p>
                  <p>(3) voter registration applications with Minnesota drivers' license numbers, Minnesota identification card numbers, or if the applicant has no driver's license or identification card, the last four digits of the applicant's Social Security number that do not match the numbers of record in the Department of Public Safety database or, in the case of an applicant who does not have a Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota identification card, in the database of the Social Security Administration.</p>
                  <p>The reports prepared by the secretary of state must include a separate list of potential matches for incomplete mail-in registrations described in Minnesota Statutes, section 201.061, subdivision 1a.</p>
                  <p>C. The county auditor must review the reports provided by the secretary of state of records that have not been verified with certainty within ten days after the reports become available in the statewide voter registration system. The auditor must attempt to match the information on the voter registration application with the information in the database maintained by the Department of Public Safety or, in the case of an applicant who does not have a Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota identification card, in the database of the Social Security Administration, to permit the auditor to verify the information supplied on the voter registration application. The auditor shall attempt to obtain from the applicant any needed information by mail or, if a telephone number or an e-mail address was provided by the applicant, by telephone or e-mail. The auditor must record on the voter record in the statewide voter registration system each registration verified in this manner.</p>
                  <p>If the auditor cannot verify information for a registration, the auditor must record that the information supplied on the voter registration application could not be verified and is incomplete pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 201.121, subdivision 1.</p>

                  <p>If a Minnesota driver's license number or Minnesota state identification card number supplied by the applicant cannot be verified because it does not exist in the Department of Public Safety database, the secretary of state or the county auditor shall correct the voter record to indicate that the number must not be used as the verification number on the voter record. In the case of an applicant who does not have a Minnesota driver's license number, Minnesota identification card number, or Social Security number that can be verified by comparison with the Department of Public Safety database, or in the database of the Social Security Administration, if the applicant has no Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota identification card, the unique voter record number generated by the statewide voter registration system must be used as the verification number for the record.</p>

                  <p>B. If, after matching the updated information with the information contained in the Department of Public Safety database or, in the case of an applicant who does not have a Minnesota driver's license or Minnesota identification card, in the database of the Social Security Administration, the accuracy of the updated information cannot be verified, the county auditor must send a notice to the voter whose information cannot be verified and request that the voter provide the information or contact the registration office.</p>
                  <p>If the discrepancy cannot be resolved, the county auditor must challenge the voter in the statewide voter registration system and may refer the matter to the county attorney. If during the verification process the Department of Public Safety provides information that indicates that the voter is ineligible to vote, the county auditor must challenge the voter in the statewide voter registration system and refer the matter to the county attorney.</p>

                <p>When entering information from a voter registration application into the statewide registration system, the secretary of state or county auditor shall:</p>
                <p>A. conduct a statewide search of the registration database to determine if the applicant has previously registered in Minnesota;</p>
                <p>B. assign the applicant to the proper voting precinct for the address provided on the application;</p>
                <p>C. determine all election districts in which the applicant will be eligible to vote;</p>
                <p>D. assign the registration record a unique identification number, and date the record as to when the registration was entered into the registration database;</p>
                <p>E. maintain a record of voting history of the registrant for at least the previous six calendar years and a record of previous registrations and changes to voter status in the state for at least two years; and</p>
                <p>F. provide information on prior registrations in other states. At periodic intervals, the secretary of state shall notify the chief election officials of other states of persons who have registered to vote in Minnesota and who indicated a prior registration in their state.</p>
                <p>The secretary of state shall establish a precinct finder that must be maintained by each county auditor. The precinct finder must identify the voting precinct that will be assigned to the applicant. For the purposes of redistricting, the secretary of state shall include geographical data from the United States Census Bureau in the precinct finder.</p>

                  <p>The secretary of state shall verify each recall petition by the following method.</p>
                  <p>A. The secretary of state shall inspect the form of the recall petition to determine whether it complies with the requirements in parts 8205.1010 and 8205.2110, subpart 1.</p>
                  <p>B. The secretary of state shall inspect each petition to determine whether it was filed within 90 days after the date of issuance. If the secretary of state determines that the petition was not filed within 90 days after the date of issuance, the secretary shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners of the reason for dismissal.</p>
                  <p>C. The secretary of state shall inspect each petition to determine whether it has been signed by a number of persons eligible to vote in the district served by the state officer subject to the recall petition that is equal to at least 25 percent of the number of votes cast at the most recent general election for the office held by the state officer subject to the recall petition. If the petition has not been signed by the required number of eligible voters and the 90-day time limit has expired during the verification process, the secretary shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners of the reason for the dismissal. If the petition has not been signed by the required number of eligible voters but the 90-day time limit has not expired, the secretary shall notify the petitioners:</p>
                  <p>(1) that the petition has not been signed by the required number of voters;</p>
                  <p>(2) of the number of additional signatures needed;</p>
                  <p>(3) that the 90-day time limit has not expired;</p>
                  <p>(4) of the number of days left in the 90-day time limit; and</p>
                  <p>(5) that the petitioners may provide the secretary with the required number of additional signatures before the 90-day time limit expires.</p>
                  <p>If the petitioners do not provide the necessary number of additional signatures during the 90-day time limit, the secretary shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners. If the petitioners provide the necessary number of required signatures within the 90-day time limit, the secretary shall continue the verification process.</p>
                  <p>D. The secretary of state shall use a random sampling technique to verify that the persons signing the petition are eligible voters.</p>
                  <p>(1) If a member of the house of representatives or senate is the subject of the recall petition, the sample size must be 650 signatures.</p>
                  <p>(2) If the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state auditor, or attorney general, or a supreme court, court of appeals, or district court judge is the subject of the recall petition, the sample size must be 2,000 signatures.</p>
                  <p>(3) The secretary shall consecutively number every completed signature line on the petition. The signature lines on the petition that correspond to the random numbers generated constitute the sample for the verification process.</p>
                  <p>(4) The secretary of state shall verify that the address given by each signatory in the sample is in the district served by the state officer subject to the recall petition and that the birth date given by each signatory in the sample establishes that the signatory was at least 18 years old when the petition was signed. Signatures from persons determined by the secretary to be ineligible to vote must not be counted.</p>
                  <p>(5) The secretary shall determine what percentage of the signatories in the sample are eligible voters.</p>
                  <p>(6) The secretary shall multiply the total number of petition signatories by the percentage of signatories determined to be eligible voters in the sample to determine how many of the signatories on the petition are deemed to be eligible voters.</p>
                  <p>(7) If the statistical sampling shows the number of signatories deemed to be eligible voters is less than 100 percent of the required number and the 90-day time limit has expired during the verification process, the secretary shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners of the reasons for the dismissal.</p>
                  <p>(8) If the statistical sampling shows the number of signatories deemed to be eligible voters is less than 100 percent of the required number but the 90-day time limit has not expired during the verification process, the secretary shall notify the petitioners:</p>
                  <p>(a) that the petition has not been signed by the required number of eligible voters;</p>
                  <p>(b) of the number of additional signatures needed;</p>
                  <p>(c) that the 90-day time limit has not expired;</p>
                  <p>(d) of the number of days left in the 90-day time limit; and</p>
                  <p>(e) that the petitioners may provide the secretary with the required number of additional signatures before the 90-day time limit expires.</p>
                  <p>If the petitioners do not provide the secretary with additional signatures during the 90-day time limit, the secretary shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners. If the petitioners provide the secretary with additional signatures, the secretary shall reverify the petition using the procedure described in subpart 1.</p>
                  <p>E. If the secretary of state determines that the petition satisfies the form requirements in parts 8205.1010 and 8205.2110, subpart 1, the petition has been filed within the 90-day time limit, that the petition has been signed by the required number of signatories, and that the statistical sampling shows the number of signatories who are eligible voters is 100 percent or greater of the required number, the secretary shall certify the petition and immediately send written notice to the governor, the petitioners, and the state officer subject to the petition.</p>

                  <p>The secretary of state shall verify each statewide Major Political Party Recognition Petition and each statewide Minor Political Party Recognition Petition by the following method.</p>
                  <p>A. The secretary of state shall determine whether the petition was filed before the close of the filing period for state and federal offices. If the secretary of state determines that the petition was not filed before the close of filing for state and federal offices, the secretary of state shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners of the reason for dismissal.</p>
                  <p>B. The secretary of state shall inspect the form of the major or minor political party recognition petition to determine whether or not it complies with requirements in parts 8205.1010 to 8205.1040 and 8205.3000.</p>
                  <p>C. The secretary of state shall inspect each petition to determine whether or not it has been signed by a number of eligible persons equal to at least:</p>
                  <p>(1) five percent of the total number of individuals who voted in the preceding state general election for qualification as a major political party; or</p>
                  <p>(2) one percent of the total number of individuals who voted in the preceding state general election for qualification as a minor political party.</p>
                  <p>If the petition has not been signed by the required number of eligible persons and the filing deadline has passed during the verification process, the secretary of state shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners of the reason for dismissal. If the petition has not been signed by the required number of eligible persons but the filing deadline has not passed, the secretary of state shall notify the petitioners:</p>
                  <p>(a) that the petition has not been signed by the required number of eligible persons;</p>
                  <p>(b) of the number of additional signatures needed;</p>
                  <p>(c) that the filing deadline has not yet passed;</p>
                  <p>(d) of the date of the filing deadline; and</p>
                  <p>(e) that the petitioners may provide the secretary of state with the required number of additional signatures before the close of the filing period.</p>
                  <p>If the petitioners do not provide the necessary number of additional signatures before the end of the filing period, the secretary of state shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners. If the petitioners provide the necessary number of required signatures before the close of the filing period, the secretary of state shall continue the verification process.</p>
                  <p>D. The secretary of state shall use a random sampling technique to verify that the persons signing the petition are eligible persons.</p>
                  <p>(1) The sample size must be 2,000 signatures for a statewide political party recognition petition.</p>
                  <p>(2) The secretary of state shall consecutively number every completed signature line on the petition. The signature lines on the petition that correspond to the random number generated constitute the sample for the verification process.</p>
                  <p>(3) The secretary of state shall verify that the address given by each signatory in the sample is in the state of Minnesota and that the birth date given by each signatory in the sample establishes that the signatory was eligible to sign the petition. The secretary of state must also determine that the signatory signed the petition not more than one year prior to filing of the petition. Signatures from persons determined by the secretary of state to be ineligible to vote must not be counted.</p>
                  <p>(4) The secretary of state shall determine what percentage of the signatories in the sample are eligible persons.</p>
                  <p>(5) The secretary shall multiply the total number of petition signatories by the percentage of signatories determined to be eligible persons in the sample to determine how many of the signatories on the petition are deemed to be eligible persons.</p>
                  <p>(6) If the statistical sampling shows the number of signatories deemed to be eligible persons is less than 100 percent of the required number and the filing deadline has passed during the verification process, the secretary of state shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners of the reasons for the dismissal.</p>
                  <p>(7) If the statistical sampling shows the number of signatories deemed to be eligible persons is less than 100 percent of the required number but the filing deadline has not passed during the verification process, the secretary of state shall notify the petitioners:</p>
                  <p>(a) that the petition has not been signed by the required number of eligible persons;</p>
                  <p>(b) of the number of additional signatures needed;</p>
                  <p>(c) that the filing period has not expired;</p>
                  <p>(d) of the date on which the filing period expires; and</p>
                  <p>(e) that the petitioners may provide the secretary of state with the required number of additional signatures before the filing deadline.</p>
                  <p>If the petitioners do not provide the secretary of state with additional signatures before the end of the filing period, the secretary of state shall dismiss the petition and notify the petitioners. If the petitioners provide the secretary of state with additional signatures, the secretary of state shall reverify the petition using the procedure described in this subpart.</p>
                  <p>E. If the secretary of state determines that the petition satisfies the form requirements in parts 8205.1010 and 8205.3000, that the petition has been filed prior to the close of the filing deadline for state and federal candidates, that the petition has been signed by the required number of signatories, and that the statistical sampling shows the number of signatories who are eligible persons is 100 percent or greater of the required number, the secretary of state shall certify the petition and immediately send written notice to the petitioners, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue, and the executive director of the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board.</p>

If the voter was sent nonregistered absentee materials and the voter is not registered to vote and a voter registration application is not found in the return envelope, the ballot board members shall open the signature and ballot envelope and, without examining or removing the ballot, remove any voter registration application from the signature and ballot envelope. The ballot board members must immediately reseal the ballot envelope with the ballot enclosed, initialing across the seal and noting on the ballot envelope the purpose for which it was opened.</p>

                  <p>Ballots returned by the post office as undeliverable to the voter at the address of registration must be securely retained. If the auditor, municipal clerk, or school district clerk is able to verify the voter's residence at that address, the ballot may be reissued. A ballot undeliverable to the voter at the address of registration must be considered a returned notice of verification and the voter's registration must be treated as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 201.12. The official conducting the election shall maintain a record of all undeliverable ballots.</p>
                  <p>If the ballot is returned by the post office prior to 20 days before the election with notification of the voter's new address within a jurisdiction holding a mail election, the auditor or clerk shall resend a ballot to the voter along with a return envelope. If the ballot is returned by the post office within 20 days before the election with notification of the voter's new address within a jurisdiction holding a mail election, the auditor or clerk shall transmit instructions on how the voter may apply for an absentee ballot.</p>
                  <p>If the ballot is returned by the post office within 20 days before the election with notification of the voter's new address within a jurisdiction holding a nonmail election, the auditor or clerk must transmit a notice via nonforwardable mail to the voter of how to register and vote at the proper polling location. This notice must be treated as a notice of late registration under part 8200.5100, subpart 1.</p>
                  <p>The auditor or clerk shall keep a list of individuals who are sent the second mailing after the rosters are printed and must provide a copy of that list to the ballot board for use in processing the returned ballots.</p>

                  <p>The only polling place required for mail balloting is the office of the election official conducting the election. The number of voting stations set up in the office of the official conducting the election must be sufficient to accommodate the number of voters expected to vote in person on election day. On election day, the official conducting the election shall provide one or more secure drop boxes where voters can deposit return envelopes containing ballots. The governing body of the jurisdiction conducting the election shall designate a suitable location where the election judges can meet on election day to receive and count ballots. The location must be open for public observation of the counting of ballots. The governing body of the jurisdiction conducting the election shall appoint election judges as provided in Minnesota Statutes, sections 204B.19 to 204B.21. For state elections, the county auditor shall appoint election judges for mail ballot precincts and shall apportion the cost of the election judges among the precincts voting by mail in that election. The county auditor may delegate the authority to appoint election judges for precincts voting by mail in state elections to the municipal clerk. During the day of the election at least two election judges must be present at the office of the official conducting the election to accept mail ballots delivered in person and to process persons registering on election day. Additional judges may be appointed as needed. If the ballots are to be counted by hand and there are more than two questions or one office to be voted on, at least one judge must be appointed for the counting of ballots for every 500 persons from whom ballots are expected to be returned.</p>

The computer program must not count the votes cast by a voter for an office or question if the number of votes cast exceeds the number which the voter is entitled to vote for on that office or question, but it must record that there is an overvote condition as referred to in part 8220.0450, item C.</p>
                <p>F. The computer program must ignore stray marks on a ballot; these marks must have no effect on any portion of the ballot.</p>
                <p>G. For the purpose of programming, the partisan, nonpartisan, and proposal sections of the ballot are independent ballots; no action of a voter on one section of the ballot may affect the voter's action on another section of the ballot.</p>
                <p>H. In partisan primary elections, the computer program must count the votes recorded by a voter for candidates in one political party only and reject all of the partisan section of the ballot if votes are cast for candidates of more than one political party, but count valid votes in the nonpartisan section of the ballot.</p>
                <p>I. In partisan primary elections the computer program must check for the situation of a voter casting votes for candidates of more than one political party prior to checking for overvote conditions.</p>
                <p>J. If the counting equipment can examine and return a ballot to the voter before counting it, the computer program must check for and reject without counting any ballot with an overvote or, at a partisan primary, with votes cast for candidates of more than one party. When the ballot is returned to a voter, an error message must indicate the type of defect and may indicate the specific office or question where the defective condition was found. The error message must print on a paper tape or display electronically.</p>
                <p>K. A mark indicating a write-in is a vote for the purpose of determining if an overvote condition exists. Except where an overvote condition for the office exists, the computer program must record that a write-in has been indicated. The program must count and record valid votes on the ballot for all other offices and questions before a ballot with a write-in recorded is separated from ballots with no write-ins recorded. The program must report, by office, the total number of write-ins recorded.</p>

                <p>The election jurisdiction must hold a public accuracy test within 14 days prior to the election for the purpose of demonstrating the accuracy of the computer programs and voting systems to be used at the election. The public accuracy test must be conducted according to Minnesota Statutes, section 206.83.</p>
                <p>The time and place of the public accuracy test must be designated by the election jurisdiction providing the computer program, which must give at least 48 hours' public notice of the time and place of the test by publication in official newspapers and by posting a notice in the office of the county auditor and each local election official conducting the test.</p>
                <p>The test must be open to the public. At least two election judges of different political parties must witness the test. The chief election official of the election jurisdiction shall explain the methods and test procedures used to determine the accuracy of the computer programs. This will include submitting as public record the certificate prepared in accordance with part 8220.1450 that all precincts have been tested using the test deck prepared under the direction of the election jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The sealed container containing the computer programs, test deck, and predetermined results must be opened and the computer programs tested to determine their accuracy on the voting systems on which they are to be used on election day. The testing of the voting systems and programs must be with the test deck prepared under the direction of the election jurisdiction. In election jurisdictions with three or fewer precincts, all the precincts must be tested. In election jurisdictions with more than three precincts, a minimum of three precincts must be tested. One precinct from each congressional district, legislative district, county commissioner district, ward, and school district on the ballot must be tested. The official conducting the election shall select the precincts to be tested.</p>
                <p>If an error is detected in any part of the testing, the cause must be ascertained, the error corrected, and an errorless count must be made on all precincts. At the discretion of the election jurisdiction, the meeting may be adjourned to a time and date certain.</p>

                <p>The vote totals for central count optical scan voting systems may be certified by either the election judges who served in the precinct or a set of election judges specifically appointed to serve at the central counting center. When the polling place closes, the election judges designated by the official conducting the election shall complete the steps in parts 8230.2030 to 8230.4150. If the vote totals are to be certified by the central counting center election judges, all processing of the ballots and certification of the returns at the central counting center must be done by the central counting center judges.</p>

                <p>A. At the polling place after voting hours have ended, the election judges shall open the ballot box, remove the ballots, and determine the total number of ballots in the box. If the number of ballots is greater than the number of persons voting and it is impossible to reconcile the numbers, the ballots must be replaced in the ballot box and one of the election judges shall publicly draw out a number of ballots equal to the excess. The excess ballots must be marked "excess" and placed in an envelope. The envelope then must be sealed. The judges shall write "excess ballots" on the outside of the envelope and put it in the transfer case. A notation of the pertinent facts must be made on the incident report. If the number of ballots counted is less than the number of persons voting, the reason for the discrepancy must be noted in the incident report. If the judges are unable to explain the discrepancy, they shall so state in the incident report.</p>
                <p>B. The election judges must identify ballots that will need to be duplicated at the central counting center or process ballots requiring duplication prior to transporting them to the central counting center. Ballots requiring duplication must be duplicated as provided in part 8230.3850.</p>

                <p>If a valid write-in vote exists, the election judges shall determine whether the write-in vote has caused an overvote. If the write-in vote has caused an overvote, the ballot is defective for that office only.</p>
                <p>If the write-in vote does not cause an overvote for that office, the election judges shall enter the candidate's name and the office on the write-in vote tally sheet. The ballot must be placed with the other valid ballots for tabulation.</p>
                <p>If the write-in vote causes an overvote for that office and the target next to the write-in vote is not completed, the election judges shall place the ballot in the envelope marked "ballots for which duplicates were or are to be made." The manner of duplication is prescribed in part 8230.3850.</p>
                <p>At the discretion of the county auditor, the processing of write-in ballots may be done at the central counting center or at the office of the local election official or county auditor rather than at the precinct polling place.</p>

                <p>Any ballots requiring duplication at the polling place or central counting center must be duplicated in the following manner:</p>
                <p>A. Whenever a ballot is required to be duplicated, the duplication process must be performed by two election judges not of the same political party.</p>
                <p>B. Whenever it is necessary to duplicate a ballot, the duplicate ballot and the original ballot must be identified with a single number written on both ballots. The number on the duplicate ballot must be the same number as on the original. When more than one ballot is being duplicated in a precinct, the numbering must be serial.</p>
                <p>C. The reason for duplication must be written on the duplicate ballot. The election judges duplicating the ballot shall initial the duplicated ballot and the original ballot.</p>
                <p>D. When duplicating a ballot, one election judge shall call from the original ballot the valid selections of the voter; another election judge shall prepare the duplicate ballot with the voter's valid selections. The duplicate ballot must be compared against the original ballot to ensure it has been accurately duplicated.</p>
                <p>E. All original ballots which require duplication must be placed in an envelope marked "ballots for which duplicates were or are to be made." The duplicate ballot must be placed with the other valid ballots to be tabulated.</p>

                  <p>Ballot counters must be programmed to return to the voter a ballot having an overvote or votes for candidates of more than one political party in a partisan primary election. Ballot counters must be programmed to print a message describing the error on a paper tape or to display the error message electronically. If the voting system is capable of emitting an audible signal while electronically displaying the error message, it must do so. The election judges shall read the error message to the voter and may explain the conditions that cause a ballot to be rejected, but the judges shall not examine the voted ballot unless the voter requests assistance or it is necessary to determine what style of replacement ballot must be given to the voter.</p>
                  <p>If the voter wants to change the rejected ballot, the election judge shall treat the rejected ballot as a spoiled ballot, place the rejected ballot in the spoiled ballot envelope, and issue the voter a new ballot.</p>
                  <p>If the voter does not want to change the rejected ballot, the election judge shall override the rejection of the ballot. No means of overriding the rejection of a ballot having defects may be used that does not meet the conditions in items A to C.</p>
                  <p>A. The override must be protected against being inadvertently activated.</p>
                  <p>B. The override must not allow more than one ballot to be processed each time it is operated.</p>
                  <p>C. An override message must be printed on the results tape, or be displayed electronically while the voting system emits an audible signal, each time the override is operated.</p>

                <p>This chapter establishes procedures for the conduct of all publicly funded and discretionary recounts provided for in Minnesota Statutes, sections 204C.35 and 204C.36. The secretary of state or secretary of state's designee is the recount official for recounts conducted by the State Canvassing Board. The county auditor or auditor's designee is the recount official for recounts conducted by the county canvassing board. The county auditor or auditor's designee shall conduct recounts for county offices. The municipal clerk or clerk's designee is the recount official for recounts conducted by the municipal governing body. The school district clerk or clerk's designee is the recount official for recounts conducted by the school board, or by a school district canvassing board as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 205A.10, subdivision 5. A recount official may delegate the duty to conduct a recount to a county auditor or municipal clerk by mutual consent. When the person who would otherwise serve as recount official is a candidate or is the spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, stepparent, stepchild, sibling, half-sibling, or stepsibling of a candidate for the office to be recounted, the appropriate canvassing board shall select a county auditor or municipal clerk from another jurisdiction to conduct the recount. "Legal adviser" means counsel to the recount official and the canvassing board for the office being recounted. The scope of a publicly funded or discretionary recount is limited to the recount of the ballots cast and the declaration of the person nominated or elected. The ballots in the envelope labeled "Original ballots from which duplicates are to be or were made" are not within the scope of the recount and this envelope must not be opened during the recount.</p>

                <p>At the opening of a recount the recount official or legal adviser shall present the procedures contained in this rule for the recount. The custodian of the ballots shall make available to the recount official the precinct summary statements, the precinct boxes or the sealed containers of voted ballots, and any other election materials requested by the recount official. If the recount official needs to leave the room for any reason, the recount official must designate a deputy recount official to preside during the recount official's absence. A recount official must be in the room at all times. The containers of voted ballots must be unsealed and resealed within public view. No ballots or election materials may be handled by candidates, their representatives, or members of the public. There must be an area of the room from which the public may observe the recount. Cell phones and video cameras may be used in this public viewing area, as long as their use is not disruptive. The recount official shall arrange the counting of the ballots so that the candidates and their representatives may observe the ballots as they are recounted. Candidates may each have one representative observe the sorting of each precinct. One additional representative per candidate may observe the ballots when they have been sorted and are being counted pursuant to part 8235.0800, subpart 2. Candidates may have additional representatives in the public viewing area of the room. If other election materials are handled or examined by the recount officials, the candidates and their representatives may observe them. The recount official shall ensure that public observation does not interfere with the counting of the ballots. The recount official shall prepare a summary of the recount vote by precinct.</p>

                  <p>Ballots must be recounted by precinct. The recount official shall open the sealed container of ballots and recount them in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, section 204C.22. The recount official must review each ballot and sort the ballots into piles based upon the recount official's determination as to which candidate, if any, the voter intended to vote for: one pile for each candidate that is the subject of the recount and one pile for all other ballots (those for other candidates, overvotes, undervotes, etc.). During the sorting, a candidate or candidate's representative may challenge the ballot if he or she disagrees with the recount official's determination of for whom the ballot should be counted and whether there are identifying marks on the ballot. At a recount of a ballot question, the manner in which a ballot is counted may be challenged by the person who requested the recount or that person's representative. Challenges may not be automatic or frivolous and the challenger must state the basis for the challenge pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 204C.22. Challenged ballots must be placed into separate piles, one for ballots challenged by each candidate. A challenge is frivolous if it is based upon an alleged identifying mark other than a signature or an identification number written anywhere on the ballot or a name written on the ballot completely outside of the space for the name of a write-in candidate.</p>

                  <p>After the ballots from a precinct have been counted, the recount official may review the challenged ballots with the candidate or the candidate representative. The candidate representative may choose to withdraw any challenges previously made. The precinct name, the reason for the challenge, and the name of the person challenging the ballot (or the candidate that person represents), and a sequential number must be marked on the back of each remaining challenged ballot before it is placed in an envelope marked "Challenged Ballots." After the count of votes for the precinct has been determined, all ballots except the challenged ballots must be resealed in the ballot envelopes and returned with the other election materials to the custodian of the ballots. The recount official may make copies of the challenged ballots. After the count of votes for all precincts has been determined during that day of counting, the challenged ballot envelope must be sealed and kept secure for presentation to the canvassing board.</p>

                  <p>The optical scan ballot shall be prepared in a sufficient number to enable the clerks to comply with Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.29. The ballot shall be prepared and printed as soon as practicable, but in no event less than 46 days before an election unless otherwise specified in statute.

                  <p>Items A to E apply to primary ballots.</p>
                  <p>A. On the partisan primary ballot, the names of the political parties that head the political party columns must be printed in as large as practicable but no smaller than 14-point bold type and must be shaded with a screen of at least ten percent. When a party does not have candidates within a given precinct, the party headings are to remain on top of each column, regardless of whether the party has a contest on the given ballot.</p>
                  <p>B. If a partisan primary ballot also includes a nonpartisan primary section, the ballot must contain a demarcation indicating the beginning of the nonpartisan section of the ballot.</p>
                  <p>C. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 206.90, subdivision 6, the instructions in Minnesota Statutes, section 204D.08, do not apply to optical scan partisan primary ballots.</p>
                  <p>D. If a partisan primary ballot has political party columns on both sides of the ballot, the instruction in subpart 13 for two-sided ballots must not be used on the ballot.</p>
                  <p>E. If a primary ballot or special primary ballot contains only a partisan primary, the instructions to the voter must include a statement that reads substantially as follows: "This is a partisan primary ballot. You are permitted to vote for candidates of one political party only." If a partisan primary ballot contains both a partisan ballot and a nonpartisan ballot, the instructions to voters must include a statement that reads substantially as follows: "This ballot card contains a partisan ballot and a nonpartisan ballot. On the partisan ballot you are permitted to vote for candidates of one political party only." If a primary ballot contains political party columns on both sides of the ballot, the instructions to voters must include a statement that reads substantially as follows: "Additional political parties are printed on the other side of this ballot. Vote for one political party only." At the bottom of each political party column on the primary ballot, the ballot must contain a statement that reads substantially as follows: "Continue voting on the nonpartisan ballot." These statements must be printed in as large as practicable but no smaller than 10-point type.</p>
                  <p>F. The names of candidates for nomination of the major political party that received the smallest average vote at the last state general election must be placed in the first column on the left side of the ballot. The names of candidates for nomination of the major political party that received the next smallest average vote at the last state general election must be placed in the second column and so on. The average vote shall be computed in the manner provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204D.13, subdivision 2. If there are only two major political parties to be listed, one party must occupy the left hand column, the other party must occupy the right hand column, and the center column must contain the following statement: "Do not vote for candidates of more than one party."</p>

                <p>The certification authority or repository must operate a trustworthy system. A system shall be regarded as trustworthy if it satisfies the most current adopted version of Common Criteria (CC) Protection Profile (PP) for Commercial Security 2 (CS2), (CCPPCS), developed and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The determination whether a departure from CCPPCS is material is governed by part 8275.0070, subpart 2. For purposes of this chapter, CCPPCS shall be interpreted in a manner that is reasonable in the context in which a system is used and is consistent with other state and federal laws. Until the referenced standard is adopted by NIST, the standard applicable for purposes of this chapter shall be the draft of CCPPCS dated March 1998. The March 1998 draft and all subsequent revisions is incorporated by reference and is not subject to frequent change. The draft is available from the State Law Library and NIST at <ref href="http://csrc.nist.gov/nistpubs/cc/pp/pplist.htm/#cs2">http://csrc.nist.gov/nistpubs/cc/pp/pplist.htm/#cs2</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This part describes the secretary's procedure for revoking the recognition of a repository without also revoking the license of the certification authority that operates the repository. Because a valid license as a certification authority is a statutory requirement for recognition of a repository, the secretary shall automatically revoke the recognition of any repository operated by a certification authority whose license is revoked, expired, or otherwise inoperative.</p>
                  <p>The secretary may revoke recognition of a repository according to Minnesota Statutes, section 325K.25, subdivision 3, for failure to comply with any requirement of this chapter or Minnesota Statutes, section 325K.25, or for failure to comply with a lawful order of the secretary.</p>

                  <p>The grounds in items A to G are the sole grounds for the filing officer's refusal to accept a financing statement for filing.</p>
                  <p>A. A financing statement that adds a debtor must be refused if:</p>
                  <p>(1) the document fails to include a legible debtor name and address for a debtor, in the case of an initial financing statement; or</p>
                  <p>(2) the document fails to include a legible debtor name and address for the debtor being added in the case of an amendment.</p>
                  <p>If the document contains more than one debtor name or address and some names and/or addresses are missing or illegible, the filing officer must index the legible name and address pairings, and provide a notice to the submitter containing the file number of the document, identification of the debtor name or names that were indexed, and a statement that debtors with illegible or missing names or addresses were not indexed.</p>
                  <p>B. An initial financing statement or an amendment adding one or more debtors must be refused:</p>
                  <p>(1) if the document fails to identify whether each named debtor or each added debtor in the case of an amendment is an individual or an organization;</p>
                  <p>(2) if the last name of each individual debtor is not identified; or</p>
                  <p>(3) if, for each debtor identified as an organization, the document does not include in legible form the organization's type, state of organization and organization number, or a statement that it does not have an organization number.</p>
                  <p>C. An initial financing statement, an amendment purporting to add a secured party of record, or an assignment must be refused if the document fails to include a legible secured party, or assignee in the case of an assignment, name and address. If the document contains more than one secured party, or assignee, name or address and some names or addresses are missing or illegible, the filing officer must index the legible name and address pairings, and provide notice to the submitter containing the file number of the document, identification of the secured party, or assignee, names that were indexed, and a statement that secured parties with illegible or missing names or addresses were not indexed.</p>
                  <p>D. A financing statement other than an initial financing statement must be refused if the document does not provide a file number of a financing statement in the UCC information management system that has not lapsed, or, until June 30, 2006, a number associated with a Uniform Commercial Code filing made in this state before June 30, 2001.</p>
                  <p>E. A continuation must be refused if it is not received during the continuation period concluding on the day on which the financing statement would lapse.</p>
                  <p>(1) The first day on which a continuation may be filed is the date of the month corresponding to the date on which the financing statement would lapse, six months preceding the month in which the financing statement would lapse. If there is no corresponding date during the sixth month preceding the month in which the financing statement would lapse, the first day on which a continuation may be filed is the last day of the sixth month preceding the month in which the financing statement would lapse, although filing by certain means may not be possible on the date if the filing office is not open on that date.</p>
                  <p>(2) The last day on which a continuation may be filed is the date on which the financing statement lapses.</p>
                  <p>F. A financing statement must be refused if less than the full filing fee is provided for the document.</p>
                  <p>G. Financing statements sent to the filing office by a means of communication not authorized must be refused.</p>

                  <p>The sole grounds for the filing officer's refusal to accept a financing statement for filing are enumerated in subpart 1. The following are examples of defects that do not constitute grounds for refusal to accept a document. They are not a comprehensive enumeration of defects outside the scope of permitted grounds for refusal to accept a financing statement for filing.</p>
                  <p>A. The financing statement contains or appears to contain a misspelling or other apparently erroneous information.</p>
                  <p>B. (1) The financing statement identifies or appears to identify a debtor incorrectly.</p>
                  <p>(2) The financing statement identifies or appears to identify a secured party or a secured party of record incorrectly.</p>
                  <p>(3) The financing statement uses or appears to use abbreviations to identify any party.</p>
                  <p>C. The financing statement contains additional or extraneous information of any kind.</p>
                  <p>D. The financing statement contains less than the information required by Article 9 of the UCC, provided that the document contains the information required by subpart 1 to avoid refusal.</p>
                  <p>E. The financing statement incorrectly identifies collateral, or contains an illegible or unintelligible description of collateral, or appears to contain no description.</p>
                  <p>F. The financing statement is accompanied by funds in excess of the full filing fee.</p>
                  <p>G. The financing statement does not include a choice of item in box 5, alternative designation, of the National UCC Financing Statement.</p>
                  <p>H. The financing statement bears no signatures.</p>
                  <p>I. The financing statement bears a name in the wrong box.</p>
                  <p>J. The financing statement does not include a completed send acknowledgment to, box B.</p>
                  <p>K. The financing statement is both a filing and a search request, and is accompanied by fees sufficient for the filing but not for both the filing and the search request, in which case the filing officer must file the financing statement and request additional fees sufficient to cover the search request.</p>
                  <p>L. The financing statement does not include the information requested in box 1d, identification number, of the National UCC Financing Statement or box 7d, identification number, of the National UCC Financing Statement Amendment.</p>

                <p>The primary data elements used in the UCC information management system are contained in items A to F.</p>
                <p>A. (1) Each initial financing statement is identified by its file number as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 336.9-102. A file number for the initial financing statement is permanently associated with the record maintained in the UCC information management system. A record is created and maintained in the information management system for each financing statement.</p>
                <p>(2) A financing statement other than an initial financing statement is identified by a unique file number assigned by the filing officer. In the UCC information management system, records of all financing statements other than initial financing statements are linked to the record of the related initial financing statement.</p>
                <p>The sequence of the identification number is not an indication of the order in which the document was received.</p>
                <p>B. The type of financing statement from which data is transferred is identified in the UCC information management system from information on the financing statement. The filing date and filing time of financing statements are stored in the UCC information management system.</p>
                <p>C. The names and addresses of debtors and secured parties are entered from financing statements and records into the UCC information management system.</p>
                <p>D. In the UCC information management system, each financing statement has a status of active or inactive. Active financing statements are those that are unlapsed or that have lapsed within one year before the determination of status, except in the case of a financing statement filed against a transmitting utility that remains active until one year after it is terminated with respect to all secured parties of record. All other financing statements are inactive.</p>
                <p>E. The total number of pages in a financing statement is maintained in the UCC information management system.</p>
                <p>F. An indicator is maintained by which the UCC information management system identifies whether or not a financing statement will lapse and when it will lapse. The lapse date is determined as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 336.9-515.</p>

                <p>When the name of a debtor or a secured party on a financing statement is that of an individual, items A to E apply.</p>
                <p>A. The names of individuals are stored separately from the names of organizations. Separate fields are established for first, middle, and last names (surnames or family names) of individuals. The filing officer assumes no responsibility for the accurate designation of the components of a name but will enter the data according to the filer's designations as required by part 8280.0340.</p>
                <p>B. Titles and prefixes, such as "doctor," "reverend," "Mr.," and "Ms." must not be stored in the UCC information management system.</p>
                <p>C. Titles or indications of status such as "M.D." and "esquire" must not be stored in the UCC information management system.</p>
                <p>D. Suffixes, such as "senior," "junior," "I," "II," and "III" are stored in a field designated for name suffixes.</p>
                <p>E. Personal name fields in the UCC information management system are fixed in length. Although filers should continue to provide full names on financing statements, a name that exceeds the fixed length is stored as presented to the filing officer, up to the maximum length of the field. The lengths of name fields are as follows:</p>
                <p>(1) first name, 50 characters;</p>
                <p>(2) middle name, 50 characters;</p>
                <p>(3) last name, 50 characters; and</p>

                <p>A. An amendment affects the status of its debtor and secured party as follows:</p>
                <p>(1) An amendment that amends only the collateral description or one or more addresses has no effect on the status of any debtor or secured party. If a statement of amendment is authorized by fewer than all of the secured parties or, in the case of an amendment that adds collateral, fewer than all of the debtors, the statement affects only the interests of each authorizing secured party or debtor.</p>
                <p>(2) An amendment that changes a debtor's name has no effect on the status of any debtor or secured party, except that all financing statements that include an identification of an initial financing statement must be cross-indexed in the UCC information management system so that an information request made under either the debtor's old name or the debtor's new name will reveal the related financing statements. The statement of amendment affects only the rights of its authorizing secured party.</p>
                <p>(3) An amendment that changes the name of a secured party has no effect on the status of any debtor or any secured party, but the new name is added to the UCC information management system as if it were the name of a new secured party.</p>
                <p>(4) An amendment that adds a new debtor name has no effect on the status of any party to the financing statement, except the new debtor name must be added as a new debtor in the UCC information management system. The addition will affect only the rights of the secured party or parties authorizing the statement of amendment.</p>
                <p>(5) An amendment that adds a new secured party has no affect on the status of any party to the financing statement, except that the new secured party name must be added as a new secured party in the UCC information management system.</p>
                <p>(6) An amendment that deletes a debtor has no effect on the status of any party in the UCC information management system, even if the amendment claims to delete all debtors.</p>
                <p>(7) An amendment that deletes a secured party of record has no effect on the status of any party in the UCC information management system, even if the amendment claims to delete all secured parties of record.</p>
                <p>B. An amendment has no effect on the status of the financing statement, except that a continuation extends the period of effectiveness of a financing statement.</p>

                  <p>A termination has no effect on the status of the financing statement and the financing statement will remain active in the UCC information management system until one year after it lapses. However, if a termination relates to an initial financing statement that indicates it is filed against a transmitting utility, the financing statement becomes inactive one year after it is terminated with respect to all secured parties of record.</p>

                <p>C.

                <p>A financing statement that is an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement and that fails to specify whether the debtor is an individual or an organization should be refused by the filing office. Items A to D apply to a financing statement accepted for filing in error:</p>
                <p>A. When not set forth in a field designated for individual names, a name is treated as an organization name if it contains words or abbreviations that indicate status such as the following and similar words or abbreviations in foreign languages: association, church, college, company, co., corp., corporation, inc., limited, ltd., club, foundation, fund, L.L.C., limited liability company, institute, society, union, syndicate, GmBH, S.A.deC.V., limited partnership, L.P., limited liability partnership, L.L.P., trust, business trust, co-op, cooperative, and other designations established by statutes to indicate a statutory organization. In cases where organization or individual status is not designated by the filer and is not clear, the filing officer shall enter the name in the organization field.</p>
                <p>B. A name is entered as the name of an individual and not the name of an organization when the name is followed by a title substantially similar to one of the following titles, or the equivalent of one of the following titles in a foreign language: proprietor, sole proprietor, proprietorship, sole proprietorship, partner, general partner, president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, M.D., O.D., D.D.S., attorney at law, Esq., accountant, or CPA. In such cases, the title is not entered.</p>
                <p>C. Where it is apparent that the name of an individual and the name of an entity are stated on a single line and not in a designated individual name field, the name of the individual and the name of the entity must be entered as two separate debtors, one as an individual and one as an entity.</p>
                <p>D. If a filing that fails to designate the last name of an individual debtor in an initial financing statement or an amendment adding the debtor to a financing statement is accepted in error, or if only the last name is designated, the following data entry rules apply:</p>
                <p>(1) an initial in the first position of the name is treated as a first name and an initial in the second position of the name is treated as a middle name;</p>
                <p>(2) an initial and a name to which the initial apparently corresponds is entered into one name field only;</p>
                <p>(3) two individual names contained in a single line are entered as two different debtors;</p>
                <p>(4) a one-word name is entered as a last name; and</p>
                <p>(5) a nickname is entered in the name field together with the name preceding the nickname, or if none, then as the first name.</p>

                <p>Information request responses are created by applying standardized search logic to the name presented to the filing officer by the filer or submitter. Human judgment does not play a role in determining the response to the information request. Items A to I govern responses to information requests.</p>
                <p>A. There is no limit to the number of matches that may be returned in response to the information request.</p>
                <p>B. No distinction is made between upper and lower case letters.</p>
                <p>C. Punctuation marks and accents are disregarded. Only the letters A to Z in upper or lower case, and numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in any combination are considered in responding to the request.</p>
                <p>D. Words and abbreviations at the end of a name that indicate the existence or nature of an organization are disregarded, including, but not limited to: agency, association, assn., associates, assc., assoc., attorney at law, bank, national bank, business trust, charter, chartered, company, co, corporation, corp, credit union, CU, Federal savings bank, FSB, general partnership, gen part, GP, incorporated, inc, limited, ltd, ltee, limited liability company, LC, LLC, limited liability partnership, LLP limited partnership, LP, medical doctors professional association, MDPA, medical doctors professional corporation, MDPC, national association, NA, partners, partnership, professional association, prof assn, PA, professional corporation, prof corp, PC, professional limited liability company, professional limited liability co, PLLC, railroad, RR, real estate investment trust, REIT, registered limited liability partnership, RLLP, savings association SA, service corporation, SC, sole proprietorship, SP, SPA, trust, trustee, as trustee, or abbreviations of the foregoing.</p>
                <p>E. The word "the" at the beginning of the name is disregarded.</p>
                <p>F. All spaces are disregarded.</p>
                <p>G. For first and middle names of individuals, initials are equated with all names that begin with the initials, and no middle name or initial is equated with all middle names and initials.</p>
                <p>H. After following items A to G, to modify the name of the debtor requested to be searched and to modify the names of debtors contained in unlapsed financing statements in the UCC information management system, the search will reveal only names of active debtors that, as modified, exactly match the name requested, as modified.</p>
                <p>I. The word "and" is the same as the symbol "&amp;."</p>

                  <p>In the event that personal service of any document is required by law, that document may be served by delivering the document to any public counter of the Office of the Secretary of State. In order for the secretary of state to accept service on a participant, the service documents must indicate the program participant's first and last name and lot number. The secretary of state must forward the service to the program participant no later than the next business day unless the program participant has requested a mail hold or is in a pending cancellation status due to undeliverable mail. If the secretary of state receives service for a program participant in pending cancellation status due to undeliverable mail, the secretary of state must attempt to contact the participant through alternative means and obtain a current mailing address. If the secretary of state cannot obtain an alternative mailing address within two business days of the receipt of service, the secretary of state must forward the service to the program participant at the address on file with the secretary of state. As the secretary of state is the agent for service of process, an affidavit of service on the secretary of state constitutes proof of service on the program participant and commences the time in which responsive pleadings must be filed.</p>
