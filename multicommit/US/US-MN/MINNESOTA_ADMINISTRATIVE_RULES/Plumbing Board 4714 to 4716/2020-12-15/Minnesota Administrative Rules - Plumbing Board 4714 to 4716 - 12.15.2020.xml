                <p><shortTitle>4714.<inline name="num">0100</inline> <b>BASIC PLUMBING PRINCIPLES.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>This code is founded upon certain basic principles of environmental sanitation and safety through properly designed, acceptably installed, and adequately maintained plumbing systems. Some of the details of plumbing construction may vary, but the basic sanitary and safety principles desirable and necessary to protect the health of the people are the same everywhere. As interpretations may be required, and as unforeseen situations arise that are not specifically covered in this code, the 23 principles in items A to W shall be used to define the intent.</p>
                <p>A. All premises intended for human habitation, occupancy, or use shall be provided with a potable water supply that meets the requirements of the commissioner of health. The water supply shall not be connected with unsafe water sources nor shall it be subject to the hazards of backflow or back-siphonage.</p>
                <p>B. Proper protection shall be provided to prevent contamination of food, water, sterile goods, and similar materials by backflow of sewage. When necessary, the fixtures, devices, or appliances shall be connected indirectly with the building drainage system.</p>
                <p>C. Each family dwelling unit shall have at least one water closet, one lavatory, one kitchen-type sink, and one bathtub or shower to meet the basic requirements of sanitation and personal hygiene. All other structures for habitation shall be equipped with sufficient sanitary facilities.</p>
                <p>D. The building sewer in every building with installed plumbing fixtures and intended for human habitation, occupancy, or use when located on premises where the Authority Having Jurisdiction has determined that a public sewer is available shall be connected to the public sewer.</p>
                <p>E. The building drainage system shall be designed to provide adequate circulation of air in all pipes with no danger of siphonage, aspiration, or forcing of trap seals under conditions of ordinary use.</p>
                <p>F. The drainage system shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to conduct the waste water with velocities that prevent fouling, deposition of solids, and clogging.</p>
                <p>G. The drainage system shall be provided with an adequate number of cleanouts so arranged that in case of stoppage the pipes may be readily cleaned.</p>
                <p>H. Where a building drainage system may be subjected to backflow of sewage, suitable provision shall be made to prevent overflow in the building.</p>
                <p>I. Each vent terminal shall extend to the outer air and be so installed as to minimize the possibilities of clogging and the return of foul air to the building.</p>
                <p>J. No substance that will clog or accentuate clogging of pipes, produce explosive mixtures, destroy the pipes or their joints, or interfere unduly with the sewage disposal process shall be allowed to enter the drainage system.</p>
                <p>K. The piping of the plumbing system shall be of durable material free from defective construction and designed and constructed to give satisfactory service for its reasonable expected life.</p>
                <p>L. The plumbing system shall be subjected to adequate tests and to inspections in a manner that will disclose all leaks and defects in the work or the material.</p>
                <p>M. Plumbing systems shall be maintained in a safe and serviceable condition from the standpoint of both mechanics and health.</p>
                <p>N. Plumbing shall be installed with due regard to preservation of the strength of structural members and prevention of damage to the walls and other surfaces through fixture usage.</p>
                <p>O. Plumbing fixtures shall be made of durable, smooth, nonabsorbent, and corrosion-resistant material and be free from concealed fouling surfaces.</p>
                <p>P. Plumbing fixtures, devices, and appurtenances shall be supplied with water in sufficient volume and at pressures adequate to enable them to function properly and without undue noise under normal conditions of use.</p>
                <p>Q. Plumbing fixtures shall be designed and adjusted to use the minimum quantity of water consistent with proper performance and cleaning. Hot water shall be supplied to all plumbing fixtures which normally need or require hot water for their proper use and function.</p>
                <p>R. All plumbing fixtures shall be installed with regard to spacing as to be accessible for their intended use and cleansing.</p>
                <p>S. Each fixture shall be provided with a separate, accessible, self-scouring, reliable trap placed as near to the fixture as possible.</p>
                <p>T. No water closet or similar fixture shall be located in a room or compartment that is not properly lighted and ventilated.</p>
                <p>U. If water closets or other plumbing fixtures are installed in a building where there is no public sewer available as determined by the Authority Having Jurisdiction, suitable provisions shall be made for treatment of the building sewage by methods that meet the requirements of rules administered by the Pollution Control Agency.</p>
                <p>V. Devices for heating and storing water shall be designed and installed to prevent all dangers from explosion and overheating.</p>
                <p>W. Sewage or other waste shall not be discharged into surface or subsurface water unless it first has been subjected to an acceptable form of treatment approved by the Pollution Control Agency.</p>

                  <p>(2) The potable water system shall remain pressurized while the rainwater catchment water system is completely drained. The minimum period the rainwater catchment water system is to remain completely drained shall be determined based on the size and complexity of the potable water system and rainwater catchment water distribution system, but in no case shall that period be less than one hour.</p>
                  <p>(3) Fixtures, potable water, and rainwater, shall be tested and inspected for flow. Flow from a rainwater catchment water system outlet indicates a cross-connection. No flow from a potable water outlet indicates that it is connected to the rainwater catchment water system.</p>
                  <p>(4) The drain on the rainwater catchment water system shall be checked for flow during the test and at the end of the testing period.</p>

                  <p>(8) Fixtures, potable and rainwater catchment, shall be tested and inspected for flow. Flow from a potable water system outlet indicates a cross-connection. No flow from a rainwater catchment water outlet indicates that it is connected to the potable water system.</p>
                  <p>(9) The drain on the potable water system shall be checked for flow during the test and at the end of the testing period.</p>
                  <p>(10) Where there is no flow detected in the fixtures that would indicate a cross-connection, the potable water system shall be repressurized.</p>

                  <p>(1) Rainwater catchment water piping to the building shall be shut down at the meter and the rainwater water riser shall be drained.</p>
                  <p>(2) Potable water piping to the building shall be shut down at the meter.</p>
                  <p>(3) The cross-connection shall be uncovered and disconnected.</p>
                  <p>(4) The building shall be retested following procedures listed in sections 1702.11.2.1 and 1702.11.2.2.</p>
                  <p>(5) The potable water system shall be chlorinated with 50 ppm chlorine for 24 hours.</p>
                  <p>(6) The potable water system shall be flushed after 24 hours, and a standard bacteriological test shall be performed. Where test results are acceptable, the potable water system shall be permitted to be recharged.</p>
                  <p><b>1702.11.2.4 Inspection.</b> An annual inspection of the rainwater catchment water system, following the procedures in Section 1702.11.2.1, shall be required.
