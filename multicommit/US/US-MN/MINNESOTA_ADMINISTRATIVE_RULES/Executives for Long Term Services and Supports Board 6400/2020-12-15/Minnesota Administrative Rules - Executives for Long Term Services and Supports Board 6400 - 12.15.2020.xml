The program director shall have authority to accept courses of equivalent content to those accepted by the board to fulfill academic course requirements specified in part 6400.6500 from students transferring to the institution and the program and from students enrolled in the program who cannot arrange class schedules to permit timely completion of the board-approved courses. The program director must report approval of courses so substituted to the board for each affected student who makes application for licensure to the board;</p>
                  <p>D. evidence of the establishment and use of an advisory group of administrators and others in the long-term care industry, including names and experience of group members and frequency of meetings, to review course requirements and practicum activities in order to provide guidance to keep courses current and make student experiences reality based and practical;</p>
                  <p>E. a description of the course of study offered or recommended by the institution for those interested in licensure as a nursing home administrator in Minnesota. Nothing in this chapter restricts institutions from designing or implementing curricula, or establishing requirements for courses, majors, or other designations offered by the institution, more comprehensive than required under this chapter for licensure;</p>
                  <p>F. a topic-by-topic review of all course requirements outlined in part 6400.6500 showing where and how within the institution's course offerings the outlined topics are covered;</p>

                  <p>Upon receipt of an application package for approval of an academic institution program to meet board course requirements, the board shall acknowledge receipt of the request and identify any missing requirements to the program director. Upon receipt of all required information, the board shall review all materials presented and may conduct an on-site visit or request an appearance by one or more representatives of the institution at a meeting to review all material for conformance to requirements. Board members shall base their decision to approve or reject an academic institution program on whether or not the application materials presented provide assurance that students completing the program at the institution will cover the course topics outlined in part 6400.6500 with sufficient depth to enable the board to infer student attainment of the knowledge, skills, and abilities to begin work as a nursing home administrator. If the application package and discussion with program officials fail to show compliance with the rules or to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the board members that they can infer beginning level competency among students completing the proposed course offerings, the board shall notify the program director in writing of the deficiencies the institution must remedy. Once all deficiencies are satisfactorily remedied, the board shall grant approval to the program or courses in writing and include reference to the institution's offerings in its correspondence with students interested in learning where courses approved by the board to meet licensure requirements are available. If the deficiencies are not corrected, the board shall deny approval for the program by written notice to the program director.</p>

                  <p>A. Every fifth year following the board's initial approval of an academic institution's program or courses, the program director shall provide a complete review of the institution's program by submitting to the board by September 1 of the fifth year, a review application package in the same format and incorporating the same information as required in subpart 2 for a new program approval application. Where no change has occurred since the initial application, the program director may submit a copy of the initially submitted information with an updated date and attestation that the information is current.</p>
                  <p>B. The board shall review the five-year program review package submitted by the institution and approve or deny continued board approval for the program as provided in subpart 3. Where the board finds it necessary to deny continued approval to a program or to specific courses, the board shall provide information to the program director about ways in which students currently enrolled in the program may obtain supplementary or alternative courses to complete the requirements for licensure in view of the revocation of approval for courses offered by the institution. The program director shall provide the information to all students enrolled in the previously approved program or courses and shall work with the students to provide a smooth transition to alternative institutions offering approved courses.</p>
                  <p>C. In addition to the five-year program review, if the board receives information that the success rates fall below the national average for candidates from the program who, during any January 1 through December 31 period, wrote for the first time the national examination for nursing home administrators developed by NAB, the board must take one of the actions described in subitems (1) to (3).</p>
                  <p>(1) If success rates are below the national average for one period, the board shall require the director to identify factors that are potentially affecting the low success rate on the licensure examination. The director shall submit a plan of corrective action by a specified date. The plan of action must be on a board-supplied form and include the signature of the director and another institutional administrative academic representative. If the following year the success rate is above the national average, no action by the board is required.</p>
                  <p>(2) If success rates are below the national average for any two consecutive periods, the board shall notify the director of a survey to identify additional factors affecting the low success rate and review progress on the plan for corrective action submitted the previous year. The survey must include the director, faculty, students, and an institutional administrative academic representative. The director shall submit a revised plan of corrective action by a specified date. The plan of corrective action must be on a board-supplied form and include the signature of the director and another institutional administrative academic representative. If the following year the success rate is above the national average, no action is required by the board.</p>
                  <p>(3) If success rates are below the national average for any three consecutive periods, the board shall require the director and another institutional administrative academic representative to meet with a committee of board members and board staff for a survey for compliance with all applicable rules and for the implementation of the plan for corrective action submitted the previous year. Upon completion of the survey, the board shall take action in compliance with subpart 3.</p>

A permit to serve a facility as an acting administrator is valid only for the holder's work with that facility and shall not be transferable to another facility. A permit to serve as acting administrator is not renewable beyond the six months for which it was issued. The board may issue a second permit to serve a facility as an acting administrator for up to six months from the expiration of the original acting administrator permit when the board finds the second permit to be in the best interests of the public. In no event shall the board issue successive permits for a total duration of longer than one year.</p>

                <p>K. Other continuing education activities not specified in items A to J may be approved for up to ten CE credits per year on an individual basis upon submission of information to the board concerning the activity in which the licensee has engaged, the results of the learning, the number of hours involved, the number of CE credits requested, and some means of verifying completion of the activity. The board shall consider the information submitted and determine whether to approve the activity and, if so, what number of CE credits to award for the activity and shall notify the requesting licensee of the board's determination.
