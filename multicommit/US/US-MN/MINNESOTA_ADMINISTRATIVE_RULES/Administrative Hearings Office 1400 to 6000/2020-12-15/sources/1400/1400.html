Unless time does not permit, a request for continuance of the hearing shall be made in writing to the judge and shall be served upon all parties of record and the agency if it is not a party. In determining whether good cause exists, due regard shall be given to the ability of the party requesting a continuance to effectively proceed without a continuance. A request for a continuance filed within five business days of the hearing shall be denied unless the reason for the request could not have been earlier ascertained.</p>
    <p>"Good cause" shall include: death or incapacitating illness of a party, representative, or attorney of a party; a court order requiring a continuance; lack of proper notice of the hearing; a substitution of the representative or attorney of a party if the substitution is shown to be required; a change in the parties or pleadings requiring postponement; and agreement for a continuance by all parties provided that it is shown that more time is clearly necessary to complete authorized discovery or other mandatory preparation for the case and the parties and the judge have agreed to a new hearing date, or, the parties are engaged in serious settlement negotiations or have agreed to a settlement of the case which has been or will likely be approved by the final decision maker.</p>
    <p>"Good cause" shall not include: intentional delay; unavailability of counsel or other representative due to engagement in another judicial or administrative proceeding unless all other members of the attorney's or representative's firm familiar with the case are similarly engaged, or if the notice of the other proceeding was received subsequent to the notice of the hearing for which the continuance is sought; unavailability of a witness if the witness' testimony can be taken by deposition; and failure of the attorney or representative to properly utilize the statutory notice period to prepare for the hearing.</p>
    <p>During a hearing, if it appears in the interest of justice that further testimony should be received and sufficient time does not remain to conclude the testimony, the judge shall either order the additional testimony be taken by deposition or continue the hearing to a future date and oral notice on the record shall be sufficient.</p>
    <p>A continuance shall not be granted when to do so would prevent the case from being concluded within any statutory deadline.</p>

    <p>Once a judge has issued a report, unless that report is binding on the agency, the judge loses jurisdiction to amend the report except for clerical or mathematical errors. Unless the report is a final order, binding on the agency, petitions for reconsideration or rehearing must be filed with the agency.</p>
    <p>Where the judge's decision is binding on the agency, a petition for reconsideration or rehearing shall be filed with the judge. The petition must be filed within a reasonable time but not after an appeal is taken nor more than one year after the decision was issued. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/14.64">14.64</a>, a petition for reconsideration must be filed within ten days after the decision in order to toll the time for appeal to the court of appeals. A notice of and order for rehearing shall be served on all parties in the same manner prescribed for the notice of and order for hearing provided that the judge may permit service of the notice and order for rehearing less than 30 days prior to rehearing. The rehearing shall be conducted in the same manner prescribed for a hearing.</p>
    <p>In ruling on a motion for reconsideration or rehearing in cases where the judge's decision is binding on the agency, the judge shall grant reconsideration or rehearing if it appears that to deny it would be inconsistent with substantial justice and any one of the following has occurred:</p>

    <p>The administrative law judge shall hold a prehearing conference prior to the hearing upon request of any party or if the judge determines that a prehearing conference is necessary.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the prehearing conference is to simplify the issues to be determined at the hearing; to consider amendment of the agency's notice if necessary; to obtain agreements about uncontested facts or admissibility of testimony or exhibits; to determine the identity and number of proposed witnesses for each party; to consider such other matters that may be necessary or advisable; to set the time, date, and place for hearing if not previously set; to identify and exchange documentary evidence; to consider whether an interpreter or other accommodation is needed; and, if possible, to reach a settlement without the necessity for further hearing.</p>
    <p>A prehearing conference shall be an informal proceeding conducted expeditiously by the administrative law judge. It may be conducted by telephone. Agreements on the simplification of issues, uncontested facts, admissibility of evidence, or other matters shall be either entered on the record at the hearing or included in a written order by the administrative law judge.</p>
