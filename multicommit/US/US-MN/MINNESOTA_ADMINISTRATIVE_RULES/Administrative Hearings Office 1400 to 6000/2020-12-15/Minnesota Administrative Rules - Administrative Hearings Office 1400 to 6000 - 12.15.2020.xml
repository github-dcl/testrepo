                  <p>The statement of need and reasonableness must summarize the evidence and argument that the agency is relying on to justify both the need for and the reasonableness of the proposed rules, and must state how the evidence rationally relates to the choice of action taken. The statement must explain the circumstances that created the need for the rulemaking and why the proposed rulemaking is a reasonable solution for meeting the need. The statement must be sufficiently specific so that interested persons will be able to fully prepare any testimony or evidence in favor of or in opposition to the proposed rules. A general description of the statute being implemented or restating the proposed rule is not sufficient. The statement must include:</p>
                  <p>A. citations to any economic, scientific, or other manuals or treatises the agency anticipates relying on;</p>
                  <p>B. citations to any statutes or case law the agency anticipates relying on;</p>
                  <p>C. if a hearing is scheduled, a list of any nonagency witnesses the agency anticipates asking to testify and a summary or description of their testimony;</p>
                  <p>D. a citation to the agency's grant of statutory authority to adopt the rule and, if the grant of authority was made after January 1, 1996, the effective date of the agency's statutory authority to adopt the rule; and</p>
                  <p>E. the date the statement is made available for public review.</p>
                  <p>The statement need not contain evidence and argument in rebuttal of evidence and argument presented by the public. If an agency is amending existing rules, the agency need not demonstrate the need for and reasonableness of the existing rules not affected by the proposed amendments.</p>

                  <p>Mediation may be initiated in the following ways:</p>
                  <p>A. Prior to the initiation of a contested case proceeding, an agency may propose mediation by filing a written request for mediation services with the chief judge. A copy of the request shall be served upon all persons whom the agency would name as parties in the notice of and order for hearing.</p>
                  <p>B. Subsequent to the initiation of a contested case proceeding, the agency, a party to a contested case, or the judge assigned to the contested case may propose that the case be mediated by filing a request for mediation services with the chief judge. A copy of the request must be served upon the agency, the judge, and all parties.</p>
                  <p>C. Upon receipt of a request for mediation, the chief judge or designee shall contact, either orally or in writing, the agency and all parties to determine whether they are willing to participate in mediation. No matter shall be ordered for mediation if the agency or any party is opposed.</p>
                  <p>D. If the chief judge determines that no party or the agency is opposed to mediation, the chief judge shall appoint a mediator and issue an order for mediation, which shall set forth:</p>
                  <p>(1) the name, address, and telephone number of the mediator; and</p>
                  <p>(2) a date by which the mediator must initiate the mediation proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The order shall be served upon the agency, the parties, and the judge assigned to the contested case, if any.</p>
                  <p>E. The mediator must initiate the mediation proceedings by contacting the agency and each party no later than the date set forth in the order for mediation.</p>

                  <p>Upon the request of any party or the judge, the chief judge shall assign the case to another judge for the purpose of conducting a settlement conference. Unless both parties and the judge agree, a unilateral request for a settlement conference will not constitute good cause for a continuance. The conference shall be conducted at a time and place agreeable to all parties and the judge. It shall be conducted by telephone if any party would be required to travel more than 50 miles to attend, unless that party agrees to travel to the location set for the conference. If a telephone conference is scheduled, the parties must be available by telephone at the time of the conference. Where mediation between the parties has previously occurred, a settlement conference will not be ordered unless all parties agree.</p>

                  <p>If, at any time prior to the issuance of a complaint in any matter pending before the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, the charging party or the respondent believes that the other is intentionally and frivolously delaying any precomplaint proceedings, it may petition the chief judge for an order imposing sanctions. For the purpose of this subpart, a respondent is any person against whom a charge has been filed. The sanctions and the procedures are as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. A party requesting the imposition of sanctions shall file a petition with the chief judge which shall include proof that a copy of the petition has been served on the other party.</p>
                  <p>B. A petition for the imposition of sanctions shall state, with specificity, the acts of the other party which are alleged to be intentional and frivolous delay; the sanctions requested; whether an oral hearing is requested; and shall include sworn affidavits of persons having first-hand knowledge of the alleged acts.</p>
                  <p>C. The party against whom sanctions are sought shall have ten working days following receipt of the petition to file an objection to the petition. The objection shall respond to each alleged act of delay with specificity; shall include sworn affidavits of persons having first-hand knowledge of the alleged acts; and shall state whether an oral hearing is requested. Objections are timely filed only if received by the office at or before 4:30 p.m. of the tenth working day. The objection shall include proof that it was served on the other party.</p>
                  <p>D. Upon receipt of a petition and objection under this part, the chief judge shall either determine the matter or assign it to a judge for determination. If either party has requested an oral hearing, it shall be conducted no earlier than ten calendar days following the receipt of a notice of the hearing.</p>
                  <p>E. Intentional and frivolous delay occurs when a party deliberately delays proceedings for immaterial, meritless, trivial, or unjustifiable reasons. In determining whether intentional and frivolous delay has occurred, the judge shall also give consideration to the number of issues and amount of damages in controversy, any pattern of similar acts by the party, and effects of the delay.</p>
                  <p>F. If it is determined that intentional and frivolous delay has occurred, the judge shall enter an order requiring the offending party to cease and desist from the act; compelling cooperation in all phases of the proceedings; or imposing any other sanctions, other than fines, deemed necessary to compel expeditious cooperation and completion of the investigation.</p>
                  <p>G. In the event the investigation results in a finding of probable cause and issuance of a complaint, the determination of intentional and frivolous delay and compliance with any orders issued under item F shall be taken into consideration in awarding damages and attorney's fees, where applicable.</p>

If the judge determines, using the criteria in subpart 1, item E, that intentional and frivolous delay has occurred, the judge shall issue an order containing any of the following:</p>

In determining whether good cause exists, due regard shall be given to the ability of the party requesting a continuance to effectively proceed without a continuance. A request for a continuance filed within five business days of the hearing shall be denied unless the reason for the request could not have been earlier ascertained.</p>
                <p>"Good cause" shall include: death or incapacitating illness of a party, representative, or attorney of a party; a court order requiring a continuance; lack of proper notice of the hearing; a substitution of the representative or attorney of a party if the substitution is shown to be required; a change in the parties or pleadings requiring postponement; and agreement for a continuance by all parties provided that it is shown that more time is clearly necessary to complete authorized discovery or other mandatory preparation for the case and the parties and the judge have agreed to a new hearing date, or, the parties are engaged in serious settlement negotiations or have agreed to a settlement of the case which has been or will likely be approved by the final decision maker.</p>
                <p>"Good cause" shall not include: intentional delay; unavailability of counsel or other representative due to engagement in another judicial or administrative proceeding unless all other members of the attorney's or representative's firm familiar with the case are similarly engaged, or if the notice of the other proceeding was received subsequent to the notice of the hearing for which the continuance is sought; unavailability of a witness if the witness' testimony can be taken by deposition; and failure of the attorney or representative to properly utilize the statutory notice period to prepare for the hearing.</p>
                <p>During a hearing, if it appears in the interest of justice that further testimony should be received and sufficient time does not remain to conclude the testimony, the judge shall either order the additional testimony be taken by deposition or continue the hearing to a future date and oral notice on the record shall be sufficient.</p>
                <p>A continuance shall not be granted when to do so would prevent the case from being concluded within any statutory deadline.</p>

In deciding what motions should be certified, the judge shall consider the following:</p>
                <p>A. whether the motion involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for a difference of opinion; or</p>
                <p>B. whether a final determination by the agency on the motion would materially advance the ultimate termination of the hearing; or</p>

                <p><shortTitle>1400.<inline name="num">7800</inline> <b>CONDUCT OF HEARING.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>In the absence of a specific provision mandating or permitting a closed hearing, all contested case hearings are open to the public. Unless the judge determines that the public interest will be equally served otherwise, the hearing shall be conducted substantially in the following manner:</p>
                <p>A. The judge shall open the hearing by reading the title of the case, asking the parties or counsel to note their appearances, and explaining the hearing procedure to unrepresented parties.</p>
                <p>B. After opening the hearing, the judge shall, unless all parties are represented by counsel or are otherwise familiar with the procedures, state the procedural rules for the hearing including the following:</p>
                <p>(1) All parties may present evidence and argument with respect to the issues and cross-examine witnesses.</p>
                <p>(2) All parties have a right to be represented by an attorney at the hearing.</p>
                <p>(3) The rules of evidence in part 1400.7300, subpart 1.</p>
                <p>C. Any stipulations, settlement agreements, or consent orders entered into by any of the parties prior to the hearing shall be entered into the record.</p>
                <p>D. The party with the burden of proof may make an opening statement. All other parties may make statements in a sequence determined by the judge.</p>
                <p>E. After any opening statements, the party with the burden of proof shall begin the presentation of evidence unless the parties have agreed otherwise or the administrative law judge determines that requiring another party to proceed first would be more expeditious and would not jeopardize the rights of any other party. It shall be followed by the other parties in a sequence determined by the judge.</p>
                <p>F. Cross-examination of witnesses shall be conducted in a sequence and in a manner determined by the judge to expedite the hearing while ensuring a fair hearing. At the request of a party whose witness is being cross-examined, the judge shall make rulings as are necessary to prevent argumentative, repetitive, or irrelevant questioning and to expedite the cross-examination to the extent consistent with the disclosure of all relevant testimony and information.</p>
                <p>G. Any party may be a witness or may present other persons as witnesses at the hearing. All evidentiary testimony presented to prove or disprove a fact at issue shall be under oath or affirmation.</p>
                <p>H. When all parties and witnesses have been heard, opportunity shall be offered to present oral final argument, in a sequence determined by the judge. Final argument may, in the discretion of the judge, be in the form of written memoranda or oral argument, or both. Final argument need not be recorded, in the discretion of the judge. Written memoranda may, in the discretion of the judge, be submitted simultaneously or sequentially and within time periods as the judge may prescribe. The judge may limit the length of written memoranda.</p>
                <p>I. After final argument, the hearing shall be closed unless a continuance has been ordered under part 1400.7500. If continued, it shall be either: continued to a certain time and day, announced at the time of the hearing and made a part of the record; or continued to a date to be determined later, which must be upon not less than five days' written notice to the parties.</p>
                <p>J. The record of the contested case proceeding shall be closed upon receipt of the final written memorandum, transcript, if any, or late filed exhibits which the parties and the judge have agreed should be received into the record, whichever occurs latest.</p>

                <p>Once a judge has issued a report, unless that report is binding on the agency, the judge loses jurisdiction to amend the report except for clerical or mathematical errors. Unless the report is a final order, binding on the agency, petitions for reconsideration or rehearing must be filed with the agency.</p>
                <p>Where the judge's decision is binding on the agency, a petition for reconsideration or rehearing shall be filed with the judge. The petition must be filed within a reasonable time but not after an appeal is taken nor more than one year after the decision was issued. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 14.64, a petition for reconsideration must be filed within ten days after the decision in order to toll the time for appeal to the court of appeals. A notice of and order for rehearing shall be served on all parties in the same manner prescribed for the notice of and order for hearing provided that the judge may permit service of the notice and order for rehearing less than 30 days prior to rehearing. The rehearing shall be conducted in the same manner prescribed for a hearing.</p>
                <p>In ruling on a motion for reconsideration or rehearing in cases where the judge's decision is binding on the agency, the judge shall grant reconsideration or rehearing if it appears that to deny it would be inconsistent with substantial justice and any one of the following has occurred:</p>
                <p>A. irregularity in the proceedings whereby the moving party was deprived of a fair hearing;</p>
                <p>B. accident or surprise that could not have been prevented by ordinary prudence;</p>

                <p>D. fraud upon the hearing process;</p>
                <p>E. mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect; or</p>
                <p>F. the decision is not justified by the evidence, or is contrary to law; but unless it be so expressly stated in the order granting rehearing, it shall not be presumed, on appeal, to have been made on the ground that the decision was not justified by the evidence.</p>

                  <p>A. The judge may, on motion and for good cause shown, grant extensions of time, other than for filing an application for fees and expenses, after final disposition in the contested case.</p>
                  <p>B. Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record of the underlying contested case and the filings required or permitted by this part. However, on the judge's own motion or on the motion of any party to the underlying contested case, further filings or other action can be required or permitted, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or an evidentiary hearing. Any further action shall be allowed only when necessary for a full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application and shall take place on the first date available on the judge's calendar which is also agreeable to all parties. A motion for further filings or other action shall specifically identify the information sought on the disputed issues and shall explain why the further filings or other action are necessary to resolve the issues.</p>
                  <p>C. In the event that an evidentiary hearing is required or permitted by the judge, the hearing and any related filings or other action required or permitted shall be conducted under parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612.</p>

                <p>A. The administrative law judge shall open the hearing by reading the title of the case, asking the parties or counsel to note their appearances, and explaining the hearing procedure to unrepresented parties.</p>
                <p>B. Any stipulations, settlement agreements, or consent orders entered into by any of the parties prior to the hearing shall be entered into the record.</p>
                <p>C. The party with the burden of proof shall begin the presentation of evidence unless ordered otherwise. It shall be followed by the other parties in a sequence determined by the administrative law judge.</p>
                <p>D. Testimony may be given in narrative fashion by witnesses rather than by question-and-answer format.</p>
                <p>E. Cross-examination of witnesses shall be conducted in a sequence and in a manner determined by the administrative law judge to expedite the hearing while ensuring a fair hearing. At the request of the party whose witness is being cross-examined, the administrative law judge shall make such rulings as are necessary to prevent argumentative, repetitive, or irrelevant questioning and to expedite the cross-examination to the extent consistent with the disclosure of all relevant testimony and information.</p>
                <p>F. Any party may be a witness or may present other persons as witnesses at the hearing. All oral testimony at the hearing shall be under oath or affirmation.</p>
                <p>G. A party may question an adverse party or any witness identified with an adverse party by leading questions and contradict and impeach that witness on material matters.</p>
                <p>H. When all parties and witnesses have been heard, the hearing shall be closed unless a continuance has been ordered under part 1400.8602.</p>

                  <p>The hearing may be scheduled in two stages. The first stage shall be for the purpose of introducing into evidence all of the prefiled direct testimony of the parties, and the cross-examination of each witness by all other parties.

The administrative law judge may give priority to those members of the public desiring to ask questions which would enable them to better prepare for cross-examination during subsequent stages. It is the intended purpose of the two-stage process to establish specific hearing dates for the primary purpose of public participation in order to avoid inconveniencing the general public by requiring them to wait until late at each hearing before having opportunity to offer direct testimony and ask questions. However, at the discretion of the administrative law judge, the applicant and other parties may present a brief summary of the prefiled direct testimony at the beginning of each session.</p>

                <p>All witnesses who offer prefiled direct testimony in compliance with part 1405.1900 shall be available for questioning by interested persons at each hearing date and place. In the event a witness cannot be available throughout the hearing process, the party on whose behalf the witness testified shall request an exemption from this rule of the administrative law judge prior to the publication of the notice of hearing. The request shall state the reasons why the witness cannot be present at each hearing, and the date, or dates, on which the witness can be available. For good cause shown, the administrative law judge shall grant the exemption and shall immediately notify the board. The board shall then include in the notice of hearing a statement indicating the name of the witness, the nature of the testimony, and the dates and places where the witness will be available for questioning by all parties and persons. The party requesting the exemption shall do so in writing and shall serve a copy of the request on all other parties. Any party may object to the exemption by filing a written objection with the administrative law judge and serving a copy on all parties within five working days of the date of the request. In the event an objection is made, the administrative law judge shall immediately notify all parties of the date, time, and place to hear arguments on the request, and subsequent to which shall issue an order granting or denying the request for exemption. The administrative law judge may also grant exemptions, at any time, upon a showing of need due to unforeseeable circumstances. The same notice and objection procedure may be followed if circumstances permit, or the administrative law judge may utilize any other procedure on deeming it more appropriate. A subsequent notice of hearing shall issue reflecting any such exemption granted by the administrative law judge.</p>
                <p>In the event a witness has prefiled testimony and fails to appear for questioning, such prefiled testimony shall be given such weight as the administrative law judge deems appropriate.</p>

                  <p>If inquiry discloses the existence of a potential intervenor, the attorney must promptly serve the potential intervenor with written notice of its right to petition for intervention and reimbursement pursuant to subpart 3. Notice to potential intervenors under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.361, may not be given before a proceeding at the office or division has been commenced. The attorney shall attach to the notice a copy of all pleadings in the case, and a copy of all notices and orders served in the case to date. The notice need not be filed with the division except as required by part 1420.1850. If a party files the notice to potential intervenors, the party shall omit the attachments in the copy filed with the division unless directly relevant to a dispute. The notice must specifically advise:</p>
                  <p>A. that the petitioner has commenced a proceeding to recover workers' compensation benefits, and that under part 1415.1250 and Minnesota Statutes, section 176.361, the potential intervenor has the right to petition for intervention and reimbursement of payments of monetary benefits, treatment expenses, or vocational rehabilitation services;</p>
                  <p>B. the name and address of parties to the proceeding and the name and address of their attorney;</p>
                  <p>C. the name of a potential intervenor's insured, if applicable, the nature of the payments made or services provided, and any identifying claim and policy number;</p>
                  <p>D. that the failure of a potential intervenor to file a motion for intervention within 60 days of service of the notice or within 30 days of notice of an administrative conference or expedited hearing shall result in a denial of the claim for reimbursement unless otherwise provided by law;</p>
                  <p>E. that, unless an intervenor's right to reimbursement is established by stipulation or otherwise, failure to personally attend scheduled administrative conferences and hearings when required by Minnesota Statutes, section 176.361, subdivision 4, or appear by an alternative method approved by the commissioner or a judge, will result in a denial of the claim for reimbursement; and</p>
                  <p>F. how the potential intervenor may obtain a copy of the intervention statute, rule, and sample form.</p>

                  <p>A. An attorney claiming attorney fees must serve on the employee and the insurer, and file with the division, a statement of attorney's fees on a form prescribed by the commissioner, including:</p>
                  <p>(1) a list of benefits which were genuinely in dispute and which would not have been recovered without the attorney's involvement and any certification or noncertification of a dispute issued under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.081, subdivision 1, paragraph (c);</p>
                  <p>(2) the amount of attorney fees previously paid for the same injury;</p>
                  <p>(3) the amount the employer and insurer are currently withholding as attorney's fees, if known;</p>
                  <p>(4) the amount claimed for attorney's fees;</p>
                  <p>(5) a statement that the attorney is licensed to practice law in the state;</p>
                  <p>(6) a statement of whether or not an application is being made for attorney fees under Minnesota Statutes, sections 176.081, subdivision 7, and 176.191;</p>
                  <p>(7) a notice that the employee or insurer has ten calendar days to object to the attorney fees requested;</p>
                  <p>(8) the date the statement was served on the employee, employer, and insurer;</p>
                  <p>(9) the full address and phone number of the employee's attorney;</p>
                  <p>(10) the number of hours spent in representation of the employee and the attorney's hourly fee; and</p>
                  <p>(11) an itemization of costs incurred and by whom paid.</p>
                  <p>The statement must be accompanied by the retainer agreement, if not previously filed. Any party may object to the statement of fees in writing within ten days of the date the statement was served. If, at the hearing or in a stipulation for settlement or mediation agreement, all parties state on the record or include in the stipulation or mediation agreement that they have no objection to the statement of attorney's fees, the judge or commissioner may issue an appropriate order without waiting ten days. Except where excess fees are requested in item B, an oral statement of attorney fees may be presented at the hearing on the record if the case has been tried to a conclusion, no objection is made at the hearing, and a retainer agreement is filed. An oral statement of attorney fees must contain the information in this item.</p>
                  <p>B. If a party claims fees in excess of the amounts listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 176.081, subdivision 1, paragraph (a) or (b), the party shall attach the following additional information to the statement of attorney fees prescribed in item A:</p>
                  <p>(1) an exhibit showing specific legal services performed, the date performed, and the number of hours spent for each service in representation of the employee;</p>
                  <p>(2) a statement of expertise and experience in workers' compensation matters;</p>
                  <p>(3) a brief description of the factual, medical, and legal issues in dispute;</p>
                  <p>(4) the nature of proof required in the case and the responsibility assumed by counsel; and</p>
                  <p>(5) whether or not a hearing on attorney fees is requested.</p>

                  <p>The statement of attorney fees or petition for excess attorney fees must include, for each benefit paid or awarded for which an attorney fee is sought, sufficient information to allow the fee determiner to apply the principles contained in this subpart.</p>
                  <p>The principles applicable to determine whether a benefit was genuinely disputed are as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. If primary liability had been denied for the claim, all compensation paid or awarded to the employee or dependent other than payment of medical and rehabilitation expenses, is used to compute the attorney's fee.</p>
                  <p>B. If there was no dispute concerning the rate, amount, duration, or eligibility for a benefit and the benefit was timely paid, the benefit may not be used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>C. The fee may not be computed on the entire amount of a benefit where only a portion of the benefit is disputed. Only the disputed portion of the benefit may be used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>D. If eligibility for the benefit is disputed, the entire benefit during the period for which eligibility was disputed is used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>E. If the rate of the benefit is disputed, only the amount paid or awarded above the rate admitted and timely paid is used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>F. If the duration of the benefit is disputed, only the portion of the benefit not conceded and not timely paid is used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>G. Benefits allegedly admitted but not timely paid may be used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>H. Benefits timely paid may not be used to compute the fee except where primary liability for the entire claim or eligibility for the benefit had been generally denied.</p>
                  <p>I. The difference between the compensation eventually paid or awarded and the amount admitted and timely paid is used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>J. The following benefits may be used to compute the fee:</p>
                  <p>(1) remodeling compensation pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 176.137, which was in dispute under this subpart;</p>
                  <p>(2) a penalty sum awarded to the employee or dependent for a benefit which was in dispute under this subpart;</p>
                  <p>(3) interest on a benefit which was in dispute under this subpart; and</p>
                  <p>(4) a benefit which was in dispute under this subpart although reimbursable to an intervenor.</p>
                  <p>K. Generally, each benefit is evaluated separately, however, if the rate, duration, or eligibility for permanent partial disability is disputed, the difference between the permanent partial disability which was conceded and timely paid and the amount of disputed permanent partial disability eventually paid or awarded is used to compute the fee.</p>
                  <p>L. The principles of this subpart apply to settlement sums. Attorney fees for a portion of a lump sum award allocated to medical or rehabilitation expenses must comply with Minnesota Statutes, section 176.081, subdivision 1.</p>

                  <p>If an objection to the requested fee has been filed and the interested parties waive their right to a hearing, the fees may be determined under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.305 or 176.322, without a hearing. A hearing must be scheduled and heard on the record if an objection has been filed and all interested parties have not waived their right to a hearing. Where no objection to the requested fee has been filed, the judge or court before whom the matter is pending shall issue a summary decision under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.305, regarding the amount of attorney fees owing under this part and Minnesota Statutes, section 176.081 or 176.191.</p>

                  <p>To request an administrative conference under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.106, on a medical dispute, an employee, insurer, or health care provider as defined by Minnesota Statutes, section 176.011, subdivision 24, must file a medical request form with the division. A medical request form may be filed by a health care provider only where the insurer has denied payment on the basis that a charge is excessive under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.136, subdivision 2. For purposes of filing by a health care provider, a claim is not considered denied based on excessiveness where the insurer asserts that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment or where the disputed treatment is for a condition which the insurer asserts is not wholly or partly casually related to the work injury. The requesting party shall serve the medical request form and attachments pursuant to part 1415.0700 and shall serve potential intervenors. The requesting party shall specify the medical disputes and attach supporting documents. A health care provider filing a medical request form must attach evidence of the insurer's denial of payment based on excessiveness, an itemized statement of charges, and the appropriate record as defined in part 5221.0100, subpart 1a. The requesting party must also specify the name and address of any potential intervenor, and the claim or policy number, if known.</p>

If the parties do not reach an agreement on the issues, they will be resolved by a decision of the judge. When the division has referred a medical or rehabilitation issue to the office under part 1415.3700, subpart 10, the medical or rehabilitation issue may also be discussed and clarified at the conference, and a decision issued under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.102 or 176.106, if:</p>
                  <p>A. all affected parties consent; or</p>
                  <p>B. a notice that the issues will be joined is issued under part 1415.3700, subpart 2.</p>

                  <p>The employee may request that the office schedule an administrative conference to discuss a proposed discontinuance of benefits. If the proposed discontinuance is based on a reason other than a return to work, the employee's request for a conference must be personally delivered or received by the division or office no later than 12 days from the date a notice of intention to discontinue benefits, which was served on the employee and the employee's attorney, was filed. The employee shall direct a written request for a discontinuance conference to the division or a telephone request to the office. If the proposed discontinuance is based on a return to work, the employee's request must be received by the division or office within 30 days of the reported date of the employee's return to work. Allowance will be made, if appropriate, for nonreceipt or delay under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.285.</p>
                  <p>If the insurer discontinues, reduces, or suspends benefits without properly serving and filing a notice of intention to discontinue benefits and with the required attachments in a situation in which a notice of intention to discontinue benefits was required under part 5220.2630 and Minnesota Statutes, section 176.238, the employee may request an administrative conference within 40 days after the employee received the last payment but no later than 12 days after a notice of intention to discontinue benefits is properly served and filed, or 30 days after the employee returned to work if the notice is properly served and filed within 14 days after the insurer has notice of the employee's return to work.</p>

                  <p>(5) the employee dies;</p>
                  <p>(6) no plausible information is presented by the employee to dispute the proposed discontinuance of the benefits;</p>
                  <p>(7) notice of maximum medical improvement was served more than 90 days before the administrative conference;</p>
                  <p>(8) an approved retraining plan ended more than 90 days before the administrative conference;</p>
                  <p>(9) the employee has failed to make a good faith effort to participate in the rehabilitation plan before the administrative conference, but is making a good faith effort at the time of the conference, in which case benefits may be discontinued between the date the notice of intention to discontinue benefits was served and filed and the administrative conference date;</p>
                  <p>(10) the workers' compensation claim was mistakenly accepted by the insurer and primary liability for the entire injury is now denied;</p>
                  <p>(11) the employee has received temporary partial benefits for the maximum period allowed under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.101, subdivision 2;</p>
                  <p>(12) the effects of the injury have totally resolved without residual disability or restrictions; or</p>
                  <p>(13) the employee has voluntarily retired from the labor market.</p>
                  <p>B. If the employee requests a continuance of the conference date that is granted and the employee is awarded ongoing benefits, benefits must be paid through the date of the conference and continuing. If the employee's request for a continuance is granted and the employee is not awarded benefits, benefits need not be paid during the period of continuance. If the employer or insurer requested the continuance, benefits must be paid during the period of continuance. If the employee and insurer's joint request for a continuance is granted, benefits must be paid during the period of continuance unless the employee agrees in writing to waive the interim payment and await a decision regarding payment under subpart 5 following the administrative conference.</p>

                  <p>Where there is no dispute about the facts or the calculation of the subrogation interest, credit, or sum payable to the employee under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.061, subdivision 5, the insurer and employee may submit a petition based on stipulated facts under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.322, to the Workers' Compensation Division for an order determining subrogation interest and credit.</p>
                  <p>A. The petition must contain substantially the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) information identifying both the district court action if any and the workers' compensation claim involved;</p>
                  <p>(2) the total proceeds of the third-party settlement or award;</p>
                  <p>(3) the amount of legal fees and costs of the third-party claim;</p>
                  <p>(4) the subrogation interest of the employer itemized by type of benefits paid such as but not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(a) temporary total disability;</p>
                  <p>(b) temporary partial disability;</p>
                  <p>(c) permanent total disability;</p>
                  <p>(d) permanent partial disability; and</p>
                  <p>(e) medical expenses where Minnesota Statutes, section 176.061, subdivision 7, claim was not made;</p>
                  <p>(5) the name, address, and telephone number of the attorney for each party if any; and</p>
                  <p>(6) the signatures of all parties indicating agreement with the information in subitems (1) to (5).</p>
                  <p>B. The parties may also, but are not required to, submit a proposed calculation of the subrogation interest, including the future credit amount and the sum payable to the employee.</p>
                  <p>C. The petitioners must file one clean copy of the petitions and attachments, suitable for imaging. The petition must be served on the special compensation fund where it has a subrogation interest based on payments made pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 176.183, or a known potential interest under Minnesota Statutes 1990, section 176.131, or Minnesota Statutes 1994, section 176.132.</p>
                  <p>D. The division may refer a petition based on stipulated facts submitted under this subpart to the office for further proceedings where the parties disagree how the subrogation interest, credit, or sum payable to the parties should be calculated.</p>
                  <p>E. Except as provided in item D, after receipt of the petition, the division shall serve on the petitioners, and special compensation fund if appropriate, an order containing the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) the information upon which the subrogation order is based;</p>
                  <p>(2) the calculation of the subrogation interest, including the future credit amount and the sum payable to the employee;</p>
                  <p>(3) an explanation of the effect of the credit upon future benefit entitlement; and</p>
                  <p>(4) notice of the parties' right to appeal the order within 30 days of its service pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 176.322.</p>

                <p>This chapter governs workers' compensation matters in litigation before the Office of Administrative Hearings. Except for parts 1420.0300 and 1420.3700, this chapter applies to litigation initiated by the filing of a petition and does not apply to administrative conferences. This chapter does not apply to matters pending at the Department of Labor and Industry. Chapter 1415 contains joint rules with the Department of Labor and Industry concerning workers' compensation litigation procedures. The two chapters together contain the litigation rules in workers' compensation cases. Rules regarding appeals to the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals are contained in chapter 9800.</p>

                  <p>A stipulation for settlement that does not include the agreement of all intervenors or that seeks to preclude rights of potential intervenors must meet the requirements of this subpart.</p>
                  <p>A. Where a potential intervenor has been excluded from the settlement for failure to timely file a petition to intervene, a statement to that effect must be made in the stipulation for settlement and the stipulation must be accompanied by a copy of the notice given to the potential intervenor under part 1415.1100 and an affidavit of service. If the judge finds a potential intervenor had proper notice or actual notice of the right to intervene within a reasonable period of time before a case was finally concluded but failed to act, the judge may order extinguishment of the potential intervenor's interest under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.361.</p>
                  <p>B. Where other parties have reached an agreement to settle a claim but have been unable to reach agreement with an intervenor, or obtain the intervenor's signature on the stipulation, the requirements of subitem (1) or (2) must be met.</p>
                  <p>(1) If the stipulation is signed by the intervenor, the stipulation must include a statement that the parties negotiated with the intervenor in good faith but the intervenor chooses not to enter into an agreement and reserves the right to petition for hearing on the merits under subpart 3.</p>
                  <p>(2) If the stipulation, or a letter of agreement attached to the stipulation, is not signed by the intervenor, the parties may file a partial stipulation for settlement that complies with Minnesota Statutes, section 176.521, subdivision 2b.</p>

                  <p>A. If the parties have not fully resolved the intervenor claim following the procedure in subpart 1 and there is no action pending at the office, a party must file a written petition under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.291, for a hearing on the merits of the intervening party's claim. The petition must be filed within 30 days after an award on stipulation is served and filed. If a petition for a hearing on the merits of an intervenor's claim is pending at the time an award on stipulation is served and filed, the office shall schedule the intervenor claims for a hearing on the merits.</p>
                  <p>B. The intervenor may present evidence that the intervenor was effectively excluded from meaningful settlement negotiations through lack of an offer of settlement, lack of notice of the right to intervene, or an unreasonable or bad faith offer of settlement. If the judge finds that the intervenor was effectively excluded from the proceeding or negotiations, full reimbursement to the intervenor will be ordered. If the judge does not find that the intervenor was excluded from the proceeding or negotiations, the intervenor must present evidence regarding the compensability of the employee's claim from which the intervenor's claim is derived as well as evidence of the intervenor's claim. The intervenor has the burden of proving the claims.</p>

                  <p>Under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.411, subdivision 2, depositions may be taken in the manner the law provides for depositions in civil actions in the district courts for the state, except where a judge orders otherwise. Upon request by an adverse party, a party must produce named witnesses for discovery deposition, except as otherwise provided by this part or Minnesota Statutes, section 176.155, subdivision 5.</p>
                  <p>A. When a party has objected to the taking of a deposition, the party requesting the deposition shall bring a motion before the judge who will determine whether the deposition should proceed. The motion must state, with specificity, the facts or other reasons supporting the need for the deposition. The judge shall order the deposition to proceed if the judge finds that:</p>
                  <p>(1) the deposition is needed for the proper presentation of a party's case;</p>
                  <p>(2) the deposition is not for purposes of delay;</p>
                  <p>(3) unusual or extraordinary circumstances exist which compel extensive discovery; or</p>
                  <p>(4) the issues or amounts in controversy are significant enough to warrant extensive discovery.</p>
                  <p>B. Depositions to preserve testimony or to present testimony due to the unavailability of the witness are allowed. The deposition must be taken sufficiently in advance of the hearing so that the deposition may be offered as an exhibit at the hearing, unless, for good cause shown, the party taking the deposition has the permission of the judge to take or file the deposition subsequent to the hearing.</p>
                  <p>C. Under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.155, subdivision 5, the cross-examination of a physician or health care provider before a hearing is specifically allowed. When a deposition for the purpose of cross-examination of a physician or health care provider is taken under this item, redirect examination is allowed. Unless ordered otherwise by a judge, the cross-examination deposition must be completed before the hearing.</p>
                  <p>D. Depositions taken for purposes of presenting testimony may be offered as an exhibit at the hearing but need not be filed with the division before the hearing.</p>
                  <p>E. The party initiating the taking of any deposition, including a cross-examination deposition under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.155, subdivision 5, is responsible for all costs of the deposition, including witness fees and court reporter fees.</p>

                  <p>If an employee claims that the employee's ability to earn has been substantially reduced because of the injury in combination with other factors, the employee must submit to a physical and verbal examination by the employer's or insurer's expert under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.155, subdivision 1, if requested by the employer or insurer. Expert reports must be provided, upon demand, to adverse parties. A party who objects to the scope of the requested examination may bring a motion for protection. The motion must be served as provided in part 1420.2250. The judge may issue an order allowed by Rule 26.03 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the district courts.

                  <p>A. A party possessing relevant surveillance evidence must disclose the existence of said evidence to opposing parties upon discovery demand but no later than 30 days prior to the hearing date, or within five business days of the date it is obtained if the evidence is obtained within 30 days of the hearing date. The surveillance evidence must be disclosed at least five business days before a hearing. If a party offers undisclosed surveillance, it is only admissible where the proponent makes an offer of proof to the judge and establishes that admission of the undisclosed surveillance is vital to prevent a miscarriage of justice or fraud.</p>
                  <p>Surveillance evidence under this part includes any photographic, video, digital, motion picture, or other electronic recording or depiction of a party surreptitiously taken or obtained without the party's expressed permission or knowledge. If the items described in this subpart were not surreptitiously obtained, they are not considered surveillance evidence. Surveillance evidence does not include the personal observations of an investigator or witness or party whether surreptitiously obtained or not, or the handwritten or recorded notes of observations. Surveillance evidence includes surveillance reports.</p>
                  <p>B. At the time of disclosure of the existence of surveillance evidence under this subpart, the party disclosing evidence shall provide a copy of the evidence to the attorney representing the subject of the surveillance, or where the subject is unrepresented, to the subject, and shall advise the other parties of the existence of surveillance. A copy of the surveillance shall be presumed to have been disclosed when sent by first class mail upon posting or delivered by messenger. In the case of surveillance evidence disclosed within ten days of the hearing date, disclosure shall be by messenger under this rule and not by first class mail. Where an edited version of surveillance is disclosed, the subject of the surveillance may request the right to view or inspect the unedited version or to be provided with a copy of the unedited version at the insurer's expense.</p>

                  <p>A request for reassignment under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.312, is subject to the same procedures set forth in subpart 2, except that an affidavit of prejudice is not required. Each party is allowed one filing per case under this subpart and Minnesota Statutes, section 176.312. For purposes of this part, "case" means the initial assignment of a judge for hearing and all subsequent hearings regarding the same parties with the same judge. If the parties to the claim subsequently change, only the new parties may request reassignment. If a judge assignment is made just prior to a hearing, a party may request reassignment orally and then file the written request for reassignment on or before the hearing date. If a judge assignment is made just before the hearing, the written petition for reassignment may be faxed to the office or filed in person on or before the date of hearing. The chief judge may reassign a case or a particular hearing to a different judge as necessary when the assigned judge is unavailable to hear the case as scheduled.</p>

                  <p>Rules governing medical evidence are as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. If a party believes that the oral testimony of a physician or health care provider is crucial to the accurate determination of the employee's disability, the party shall file a written motion pursuant to part 1420.2250.</p>
                  <p>B. If medical evidence is submitted in the form of written reports, rather than by oral testimony, under Minnesota Statutes, section 176.155, subdivision 5, the reports should include:</p>
                  <p>(1) the date of the examination;</p>
                  <p>(2) the history of the injury;</p>
                  <p>(3) the patient's complaints;</p>
                  <p>(4) the source of all facts in the history and complaints;</p>
                  <p>(5) findings on examination;</p>
                  <p>(6) opinion as to the extent of disability and work limitations, if any;</p>
                  <p>(7) the cause of the disability and, if applicable, whether the work injury was a substantial contributing factor toward the disability;</p>
                  <p>(8) the medical treatment indicated;</p>
                  <p>(9) if permanent disability is an issue, an opinion as to whether or not the permanent disability has resulted from the injury and whether or not the condition has stabilized. If stabilized, a description of the disability with a complete evaluation;</p>
                  <p>(10) if a permanent partial disability is a result of two or more injuries or occurrences, or if part of the permanent disability is a result of a preexisting disability that arises from a congenital condition, traumatic injury, or incident, whether or not compensable under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 176, the health care provider shall apportion the disability between the injuries, occurrences, or conditions;</p>
                  <p>(11) if future medical care or treatment is anticipated, a statement of the nature and extent of treatment recommended and, if possible, the anticipated results;</p>
                  <p>(12) the reason for each opinion; and</p>
                  <p>(13) if applicable, a statement that the health care provider has read the rules concerning determination of permanent partial disability, understands them, and has applied those rules in making the determination.</p>
                  <p>C. Medical reports to be used at the hearing must be served on the parties and filed with the office, with an affidavit of service, sufficiently in advance of the hearing to allow other parties the opportunity to cross-examine the health care provider, if desired, unless the delay in filing the report was caused by a failure of the employee to report for an adverse medical examination or to provide medical support for the claim on a timely basis, or other good cause. If the report is filed too late to allow the cross-examination, the record will be held open to allow other parties to either cross-examine the health care provider after the hearing or provide a follow-up report from an expert of the other parties.</p>

                  <p>(1) After opening the hearing, the judge shall, unless all parties are represented by counsel, state the procedural rules for the hearing.</p>
                  <p>(2) Stipulations entered into by the parties before the hearing must be entered into the record.</p>
