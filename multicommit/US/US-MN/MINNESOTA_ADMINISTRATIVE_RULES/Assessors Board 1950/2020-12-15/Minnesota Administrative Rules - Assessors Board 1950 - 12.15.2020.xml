                  <p>To maintain a specific level of licensure, an assessor must take continuing education. A certified Minnesota assessor or certified Minnesota assessor specialist license holder must obtain at least 50 continuing education hours during a four-year period. An accredited Minnesota assessor or senior accredited Minnesota assessor license holder must obtain at least 60 continuing education hours. Any assessment-related seminar or coursework mandated by statute qualifies for continuing education hours. The four-year educational period begins July 1 of every presidential election year and ends June 30 of the succeeding presidential election year. An assessor who upgrades a license, for example, by moving from a certified Minnesota assessor to an accredited Minnesota assessor, during this four-year period must only obtain the continuing education hours needed for the license held at the beginning of the educational period.</p>

                  <p>Continuing education hours are given in three general categories.</p>
                  <p>A. Educational courses or seminars in assessment or appraisal subjects are eligible for continuing education hours. The sponsor of such courses may apply to the board for continuing education hours approval, or the recipient of the instruction may apply either before or after the course has been given. One continuing education hour is given for each instructional hour.</p>
                  <p>B. In addition to the courses and seminars in item A, the board may grant continuing education hours for coursework and seminars in management, public relations, supervision, and computer applications training that are specific to the assessment field.</p>
                  <p>C. At the discretion of the board, continuing education hours may be given for such activities as writing, developing, revising, teaching or assisting in the presentation of an assessment or appraisal course or seminar. Continuing education hours may be granted in these instances after the board has reviewed such factors as time, content, professional level, and appropriateness of the activity.</p>

                  <p>The board may specify that the revocation is permanent, or it may specify a period of time after which the assessor may reapply for a license. If an assessor's license has been revoked, all of the assessor's course work and all assessor education hours granted by the board used to obtain, upgrade, or keep an assessor's license and all previous levels of licensure are also revoked and the assessor must meet all educational requirements of the level of license being applied for anew. The board shall consider the same factors in license revocation proceedings as are considered in matters of license suspension.</p>

                  <p>Certain activities outside the scope of the assessor's office may give the appearance of a conflict of interest to the taxpayers of the assessor's jurisdiction. These activities include the performance of fee appraisals, tax representation or consultation, real estate sales, insurance sales, and property management. In order to avoid situations which could compromise the integrity of the assessor's office, each assessor applying for a license is required to list on the license application any outside activities such as those stated above. All employers of assessors engaged in outside activities will be notified of this fact by the board by December 31 of each year. Whether or not the assessor may continue the outside activities shall be a condition of the employer-employee agreement. The board will not specifically prohibit an assessor from engaging in these outside activities, except that no assessor will be allowed to perform fee appraisals within the assessor's specific assessment jurisdiction. An assessor who performs fee appraisals within the assessor's specific assessment jurisdiction will be subject to the disciplinary measures shown in subparts 2 and 4. An assessor who falsifies a license application by not listing outside activities is subject to the penalties shown in subpart 2.</p>
