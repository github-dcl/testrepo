                  <p>An educational institution intending to establish a nursing education program in Minnesota must be surveyed as outlined in items A to C.</p>
                  <p>A. Phase I - Intent to establish program.</p>
                  <p>(1) An educational institution under Minnesota Statutes, section 148.251, subdivision 1, must submit a letter of intent to establish a new nursing education program. The letter of intent must be submitted by the qualified director of the proposed program. Documentation in the letter of intent to establish a program must:</p>
                  <p>(a) be submitted 12 months prior to the intended start date of the program;</p>
                  <p>(b) include name, address, and current accreditation of the governing body;</p>
                  <p>(c) provide rationale for establishing the nursing education program;</p>
                  <p>(d) present a timetable for development and implementation of the nursing program;</p>
                  <p>(e) provide evidence of adequate financial support and resources;</p>
                  <p>(f) document availability of adequate academic facilities;</p>
                  <p>(g) include impact of the proposed nursing education program on other nursing programs in the area; and</p>
                  <p>(h) provide documentation of authorization by the designated review board for that educational institution to develop and implement a program.</p>
                  <p>(2) The board must approve the document of intent.</p>
                  <p>(3) Until a controlling body has received initial approval to conduct a program, representatives of the body shall use the term "proposed" in all references to the nursing program.</p>
                  <p>B. Phase II - Program development leading to initial approval.</p>
                  <p>(1) The director of the proposed program must submit an application for approval documenting compliance with education standards and criteria specified in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(2) Board members must conduct a site visit when the application demonstrates compliance with nursing education standards and criteria specified in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>(3) Board site visitors must submit a recommendation to the board to grant initial approval or deny initial approval.</p>
                  <p>(4) The institution must not conduct nursing coursework until the board approves the recommendation for initial approval. This restriction does not prevent the controlling body from conducting nonnursing courses or from providing continuing education to nursing personnel.</p>
                  <p>(5) After receiving initial approval, the director must submit all required board annual reports including all reports and communication regarding candidacy for national nursing education accreditation or nursing-related accreditation.</p>
                  <p>C. Phase III - Continuing approval. Under Minnesota Statutes, section 148.251, subdivision 3, the board must survey initially approved nursing programs, and continue approval for the program if the program is in compliance with board rules, including:</p>
                  <p>(1) meeting the minimum first-time licensure examination success rate as required by subpart 4; and</p>
                  <p>(2) acquiring national nursing education accreditation or nursing-related accreditation, as required by subpart 6.</p>

                  <p>A. Confirmation of graduation or a transcript is required if an applicant graduated from an approved nursing program in a United States jurisdiction or Canadian province. If an applicant submits confirmation of graduation, the confirmation must be completed and signed by an official of the nursing program or controlling institution and must bear the seal or stamp of the program or controlling institution. If the applicant submits a transcript, it must be an official transcript from the educational institution or nursing program that verifies that the applicant has graduated from the nursing program.</p>
                  <p>B. Confirmation of eligibility for graduation is required if an applicant is eligible to graduate from an approved nursing program in a United States jurisdiction or Canadian province. If an applicant submits a confirmation of eligibility for graduation, the confirmation must be completed and signed by an official of the nursing program or controlling institution and must bear the seal or stamp of the program or controlling institution.</p>
                  <p>C. If the board finds after the examination has been taken that the confirmation of program completion was completed in error, the examination results shall not be released nor action taken on the application until the applicant has met all requirements for program completion. If there is evidence that the applicant was aware of not meeting program requirements before the examination and did not inform the board, the matter may be handled through a disciplinary proceeding.</p>

                  <p>(2) fee for licensure;</p>
                  <p>(3) confirmation of program completion;</p>

The board may require further information of the applicant in order to determine whether the applicant has engaged in conduct warranting disciplinary action. An applicant must submit true information. Falsification or omission of information provides grounds for denial of a license. If the request is received without a fee, it shall be returned to the applicant.</p>
                  <p>E. An applicant must complete a review course if:</p>
                  <p>(1) it has been five or more years since the applicant completed a program; or</p>

                  <p>"Registration period" means the interval of time during which the individual is authorized to engage in advanced practice, professional, or practical nursing during a registration period. The initial registration period following licensure, endorsement, or reregistration is from six to 29 full calendar months starting on the day of licensure, endorsement, or reregistration and ending on the last day of the licensee's month of birth in an even-numbered year if the year of birth was an even-numbered year or in an odd-numbered year if the year of birth was in an odd-numbered year. Subsequent registration periods are 24-month periods. For registration renewal, the period starts on the first day of the month following expiration of the previous registration period. The period ends the last day of the licensee's month of birth in an even- or odd-numbered year according to the licensee's year of birth.</p>

                  <p>A. The board shall provide a registration renewal notice at least three full calendar months before a licensee's registration expiration date using the last contact information provided by the licensee which constitutes official notification. Failure to receive the registration renewal notice sent by the board does not relieve the licensee of the obligation to renew registration by the expiration date.</p>
                  <p>B. A licensee shall submit the completed registration renewal application, fee, and continuing education report to the board in time for the application to be received in the board office by the registration expiration date. The board shall return an application that is received without a fee or an application that is incomplete. The licensee must resubmit the application and fee by the licensee's registration expiration date.</p>
                  <p>C. A licensee shall respond to questions on the application that relate to the grounds for disciplinary action listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 148.261. The licensee shall submit true information. Falsification or omission of information provides grounds for disciplinary action. The board may require further information of the licensee to determine whether the licensee has engaged in conduct warranting disciplinary action listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 148.261.</p>

                  <p>Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 326.56, a licensee who is in the armed forces of the United States or is employed outside the United States in employment which is essential to the prosecution of any war or the national defense, and whose registration was in effect at the time of entry into the armed forces or engagement in employment outside the United States, is not obligated to renew registration. The board must be notified in writing by the licensee regarding the qualifications for this exemption. The exemption ceases six months after discharge from active duty or termination of the aforementioned employment. A registration renewal notice shall be sent to the licensee at the time that a registration renewal notice would normally be sent to the licensee. The licensee may be requested to reconfirm exempt status. If the licensee no longer qualifies for the exemption, the requirements for registration renewal must be met. The required number of contact hours are calculated based on the number of months since the exemption ceased to the month of the registration renewal expiration date and according to the ratio specified in subpart 3.</p>

                  <p>The reporting required of institutions in Minnesota Statutes, section 148.263, subdivision 2, is interpreted to include resignation in lieu of discharge, discharge, suspension, or other forms of discipline of a nurse for failure to carry out the responsibilities of a nurse. Examples of actions to be reported include but are not limited to dismissal of probationary employees, suspensions other than investigatory suspensions, restrictions or limitations of a nurses's practice, demotion, and discharge from employment.</p>
