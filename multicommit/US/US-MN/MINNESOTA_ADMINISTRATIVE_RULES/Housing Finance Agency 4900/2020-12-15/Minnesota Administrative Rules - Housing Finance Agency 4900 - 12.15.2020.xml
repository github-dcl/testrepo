                <p>Improvements made with home improvement loan proceeds shall satisfy the following requirements:</p>
                <p>A. Improvements may be made in order: to comply with applicable state, county, and municipal health, housing, building, fire prevention, and housing maintenance codes, or other public standards applicable to housing; or to make the property more desirable to live in; or to increase the market value of the property; or to make the property more habitable; or to make the property more accessible to a person with a disability as provided in parts 4900.0710 to 4900.0740.</p>
                <p>B. Each improvement must be a permanent general improvement. Permanent general improvements shall include additions, alterations, renovations, or repairs upon or in connection with existing structures, which materially preserve or improve the basic livability, safety, or utility of the property. Permanent general improvements shall not include materials, fixtures, or landscaping of a type or quality exceeding that customarily used in the locality for properties of the same general type as the property to be improved.</p>
                <p>C. Each improvement must be made in compliance with all applicable health, fire prevention, building, and housing codes and standards; provided, however, that no application for a home improvement loan for property occupied by the owner shall be denied solely because the improvements will not bring such property into full compliance with all such codes and standards.</p>
                <p>D. Home improvement loan proceeds shall not be used for the payment, wholly or in part, of assessments for public improvements; provided, however, that such proceeds may be used for improvements which will bring an individual sewage disposal system (including septic systems) located on the property into compliance with local, state, or federal environmental and sanitary standards.</p>
                <p>E. All contracts covering all or any portion of an improvement must contain an MHFA approved warranty of construction and materials.</p>

                <p>A. The property shall be located within the state of Minnesota, be used primarily for residential purposes, and contain no more than two dwelling units, one of them owner-occupied.</p>
                <p>B. The property to be improved shall conform to applicable zoning ordinances and possess all appropriate use permits.</p>
                <p>C. The improvements shall be made upon or in connection with existing structures, including mobile homes. Trailers shall not be eligible.</p>
                <p>D. No property shall be eligible for a home improvement grant or deferred loan if it has been improved by such a grant or loan within the five-year period immediately preceding the date on which application for such grant or loan is made. No property is eligible for a revolving loan if it has been improved by a revolving loan within the two-year period immediately preceding the date on which application for the loan is made. These limitations do not apply in extraordinary circumstances relating to damage to the property as a result of events beyond the control of the applicant or to failure of plumbing, heating, or electrical systems, or defects in the roof or foundation systems, as determined by the agency in its sole discretion.</p>
                <p>E. The property to be improved with grant or loan funds shall be reasonably efficient with respect to energy consumption. Where the property is not reasonably efficient with respect to energy consumption, rehabilitation funds shall be used to the extent necessary to increase such efficiency. Energy-saving features shall include, but not be limited to, installation or upgrading of ceiling, wall, floor, and duct insulation, storm windows and doors, and caulking and weather stripping. Energy-saving features shall be consistent with the energy standards promulgated as part of the State Building Code but such improvements need not bring the housing into full compliance with such energy standards.</p>

                <p>The agency may arrange to leverage urban Indian housing loan program funds, interest free, with other funds from the agency or another private or public source in order to reduce the interest rate on individual mortgage loans to affordable levels. A maximum of 30 percent of the total financing provided for each individual mortgage may be provided from urban Indian housing loan program funds. The mortgage note or coupon rate is established for each individual mortgage loan in the following manner:</p>
                <p>Ys = Interest rate for the independent funding source</p>
                <p>S = Funding source's percentage of total mortgage loan</p>
                <p>I = Urban Indian program's percentage of total mortgage loan</p>
                <p>S/F = Servicing fee</p>
                <p>(Ys x S) + (I x S/F) = note or coupon rate</p>
                <p>Examples of sources of funds that may be leveraged with urban Indian program funds include, but are not limited to, proceeds from agency mortgage revenue bond sales, proceeds from municipal or county mortgage revenue bond sales, mortgage commitments from private mortgage lenders or secondary mortgage market organizations, or mortgage commitments from nonprofit, public, or governmental sources. In cases in which mortgage revenue bond proceeds are used, all requirements or restrictions imposed on the use by the bond issuer, except as may be specifically modified by the issuer to facilitate the purpose of the urban Indian housing program, must be in full force and effect and complied with. In cases in which sources of funds are provided from other than mortgage revenue bond proceeds, the following requirements or restrictions are also imposed unless specifically waived by the commissioner or agency.</p>
                <p>A. Recipients may not have had an ownership interest in a principal residence for three years directly before the date of mortgage loan closing as provided in Internal Revenue Code, section 103A.</p>
                <p>B. Recipients must intend to occupy the property as a principal residence within 60 days of loan closing.</p>
                <p>C. Both recipients and properties to be mortgaged must meet mortgage industry underwriting standards pertaining to the type of mortgage being provided, for example, FHA, VA, or conventional mortgage.</p>
                <p>The agency shall establish a maximum purchase price limitation for homes to be financed under this part that in no instance may exceed the amount provided under the agency's mortgage revenue bond programs.</p>

                  <p>The grants must be used by eligible organizations to buy eligible properties and pay for the cost of acquiring and rehabilitating those properties, or acquiring and demolishing those properties and constructing new single-family homes. The agency may establish an allocation plan for the program to provide for the greater likelihood of awarding such grants among urban and rural properties. The agency may establish a priority that new construction is only permitted on a case-by-case review, as described in part 4900.2520, subpart 4. The agency may also establish requirements pertaining to maximum allowable administrative costs under the program, but in no instance may the administrative costs exceed ten percent of the amount awarded per eligible organization from funds appropriated for the program during the period of acquisition, rehabilitation, or as permitted, demolition and construction, and sale.</p>

                  <p>Eligible properties are to be rehabilitated, at a minimum, to the Housing Quality Standards as established in Code of Federal Regulations, title 24, section 882.404, and changed from time to time by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Applicants may provide for rehabilitation of properties beyond Housing Quality Standards where it is feasible, and are encouraged to do so. All rehabilitation work must also satisfy the following requirements:</p>
                  <p>A. Rehabilitation improvements may be made in order to comply with applicable state, county, and municipal health, housing, building, fire prevention, and housing maintenance codes, or other public standards applicable to housing; make the property more desirable to live in; increase the market value of the property; make the property more habitable; make the property more accessible to a person with a disability; or make the property more energy efficient.</p>
                  <p>B. Each rehabilitation improvement must be a permanent general improvement. Permanent general improvements include additions, alterations, renovations, or repairs upon or in connection with existing structures that materially preserve or improve the basic livability, safety, or utility of the property. Permanent general improvements do not include materials, fixtures, or landscaping of a type or quality exceeding that customarily used in the locality for properties of the same general type as the property to be improved.</p>
                  <p>C. Each rehabilitation improvement must be made in compliance with all applicable health, fire prevention, building, and housing codes and standards; provided, however, that no requirement may be imposed under the program that will preclude rehabilitation solely because the improvements will not bring the property into full compliance with all codes and standards.</p>

                <p>Minnesota Statutes, section 462A.073, limits new construction in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area. The statute allows new housing that is part of a housing affordability initiative that meets one or more of the criteria in items A to F.</p>
                <p>A. The program is accepted or designated under the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Affordable Housing Program or any successor program sponsored by HUD to encourage affordable new housing.</p>
                <p>B. The program provides that financial resources other than those necessary to complete the mortgage revenue bond sale are applied to reduce the cost of the housing or improve the terms of the mortgage loans provided through the sale. A contribution greater than or equal to five percent of the purchase price of each newly constructed home to be financed with mortgage revenue bond proceeds must be provided to meet this criterion. The contribution may be provided either in whole or in part from federal, state, or local government resources or programs, private foundations, or the Federal Housing Finance Board.</p>
                <p>C. The program provides that the applicable local government authority in the jurisdiction in which the new housing is to be constructed takes affirmative steps to relax regulation to result in greater housing affordability. The steps must demonstrably reduce the cost of the housing by at least five percent.</p>
                <p>D. The program supports the efforts of housing groups that support self-help or owner built housing initiatives in which at least 15 percent of the labor or materials or both needed to complete the new housing is acquired or donated through the efforts of such groups.</p>
                <p>E. The program provides that the new housing is constructed by a nonprofit entity as defined in part 4900.0010, subpart 21, that has as a primary purpose the provision or development of affordable housing to low- and moderate-income home buyers.</p>
                <p>F. The new housing is located on a parcel purchased by the city or conveyed to the city under Minnesota Statutes, section 282.01, subdivision 1.</p>

                <p>Parts 4900.3430 to 4900.3434 govern the implementation of the publicly owned neighborhood land trust program authorized by Minnesota Statutes, section 462A.202, subdivision 6. The program provides funding to acquire, construct, and rehabilitate housing, including land and buildings, by the use of a land trust.</p>
                <p>Under this program, a city will retain ownership of the land in perpetuity, but provide a long-term lease, generally 99 years, for the use of the land and buildings to either persons and families of low and moderate income or qualified nonprofit corporations.</p>
                <p>These activities are financed with proceeds from state general obligation bonds.</p>

                  <p>A. The agency shall award challenge program loans in the form of a deferred loan unless an amortizing loan is requested by the borrower and deemed financially feasible by the agency. The agency shall base its determination of financial feasibility on whether the rental housing shall generate enough cash flow to support the amortizing loan. In making this determination, the agency shall consider the rental housing's projected income less its projected expenses. The term of the loan is 30 years from the date of the loan closing; however, the agency may adjust the loan term based on any of the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(1) requirements and conditions of other funding sources related to loan term;</p>
                  <p>(2) the existence of a leasehold mortgage on the property benefited by the loan; or</p>
                  <p>(3) economic analysis by agency staff demonstrating that the housing will not have sufficient value at the end of the loan term to allow the borrower to repay the loan.</p>
                  <p>B. Challenge program loans bear interest at a rate of zero percent unless a higher interest rate is necessary to allow challenge program funds to be used with other funding sources. Principal and interest, if any, is due and payable at the end of the 30-year term.</p>

                  <p>B. Challenge program grants must be repaid in full to the agency if the grant recipient does not comply with the conditions of the grant agreement with the agency.

                  <p>Challenge program funds provided in the form of a loan may be interim loans or deferred loans.</p>
                  <p>A. The agency may provide challenge program funds in the form of an interim loan to acquire, rehabilitate, demolish, or construct owner-occupied housing. Interim loans bear interest at a rate of two percent unless the interest rate would adversely affect the affordability of the housing for the eligible home buyers that the applicant is proposing to serve, in which case the interim loan is interest free.</p>
                  <p>The term of an interim loan is 20 months; however, the agency may adjust the loan term based on requirements and conditions of other funding sources related to the loan term or economic analysis by agency staff of the financial feasibility of the owner-occupied housing. The determination of financial feasibility shall be based on whether all sources of funding are available and sufficient to cover the total development costs of the housing. Principal and interest, if any, is due and payable at the end of the 20-month term. Interim loans shall not be transferred to eligible home buyers.</p>
                  <p>B. The agency may also provide challenge program funds in the form of an interest-free deferred loan for purposes of interim or permanent financing. A deferred loan is used to help bridge funding gaps not covered by a first mortgage or other sources of funding for owner-occupied housing. A deferred loan must be repaid:</p>
                  <p>(1) when the owner-occupied housing constructed, acquired, or improved with the proceeds of the deferred loan is sold, transferred, or otherwise conveyed by the eligible home buyer;</p>
                  <p>(2) when the eligible home buyer ceases to use owner-occupied housing constructed, acquired, or improved with the proceeds of the deferred loan as owner-occupied housing; or</p>
                  <p>(3) on the date that is 30 years from the date of the loan closing;</p>

                  <p>B. The successful applicant may retain the proceeds of the challenge program loan and revolve the funds under either of the following two conditions:</p>
                  <p>(1) Condition one:</p>
                  <p>(a) the successful applicant uses the challenge program funds for the same purpose for which the agency originally awarded the funds within two years of the original award; and</p>
                  <p>(b) the location of the owner-occupied housing to be acquired, rehabilitated, or constructed with the funds is identified in the application.</p>
                  <p>The successful applicant's authority to revolve the funds beyond the initial two years may be renewed upon application to and approval by the agency.</p>
                  <p>(2) Condition two:</p>
                  <p>(a) the successful applicant uses the challenge program funds to finance the difference between the cost of the owner-occupied housing and the amount that the eligible home buyers targeted by the successful applicant can afford for housing, based on industry standards and practices; and</p>

                <p>B. The assisted units in the proposed housing development must provide rental housing for persons and families whose gross incomes, at the time of initial occupancy, do not exceed 60 percent of median income as determined by HUD for the metropolitan area. This median income may be adjusted for family size for families with five or more people. A household with Section 8 project-based or voucher assistance is deemed to meet the income requirements of this item.</p>
                <p>C. The proposed housing developments must consist of a minimum of four rental housing units.</p>
                <p>D. The use restrictions in this part must remain in effect until the later of:</p>

At least 75 percent of funds in the housing trust fund program must be used for the benefit of persons and families whose gross incomes, at the time of initial occupancy, do not exceed 30 percent of the median family income for the metropolitan area. This median income may be adjusted for family size for families with five or more people.

                <p>A. The agency shall review the performance of administrators on an annual basis. Administrators may, at that annual review, apply for an extension of rental assistance funding.</p>
                <p>B. The agency shall consider the following factors when determining whether an administrator will receive an extension of funding:</p>
                <p>(1) the performance of the administrator, including its timely expenditure of rental assistance funds and its success in reaching the goals and objectives described in its application;</p>
                <p>(2) the availability of funding for housing trust fund program rental assistance;</p>
                <p>(3) the availability of funding for rental assistance from sources other than the housing trust fund program;</p>
                <p>(4) market conditions in the administrator's service area, such as area vacancy rates, market rents, and the utilization of Section 8 vouchers; and</p>
                <p>(5) the selection standards in part 4900.3765 and the funding priorities in part 4900.3766.</p>
                <p>If the agency does not approve an extension of funding for an administrator, the administrator shall give written notice to all participating tenants and owners or management agents that the rental subsidies will end. This notice must be given no fewer than six months before the rental subsidy will end.</p>
