                <p>Parts 3300.3100 to 3300.3270 govern the certification of centers for independent living as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 268A.01.

                  <p>(b) the parent or parents claimed the eligible individual as a dependent for federal income tax purposes in the most recent calendar year; or</p>

                  <p>An eligible individual who cannot pay for vocational rehabilitation services to the extent required in subpart 1 may apply to the director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee for a variance in the determination of financial need as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. A request for a variance must be submitted in writing by the eligible individual or the eligible individual's legal representative. The request must provide the director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee with evidence describing the unusual financial situation. If the director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee requires additional information to determine eligibility for a variance, the agency must, within 15 days after receiving the written request, inform the eligible individual in writing of the specific additional information required.</p>
                  <p>B. The director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee must determine whether the eligible individual is eligible for a variance and notify the eligible individual of the determination in writing 30 days after the director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee receives all the information required under item A. The written notification must:</p>
                  <p>(1) specify whether the eligible individual is eligible for a variance;</p>
                  <p>(2) indicate the reasons for the determination;</p>

                  <p>C. The director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee shall grant a variance only if the eligible individual demonstrates that it is impossible for the eligible individual to make the cost contributions required under subpart 1 because of extraordinary costs resulting from illness or disability in areas such as mobility, communication, self-care, medical care, shelter, food, and clothing.</p>
                  <p>D. The director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee shall determine the amount of a variance by:</p>
                  <p>(1) calculating the sum of the eligible individual's extraordinary expenditures identified under item C that make it impossible for the eligible individual to make the cost contributions required under subpart 1; and</p>
                  <p>(2) subtracting the sum in subitem (1) from the financial participation amount the eligible individual would have to pay without the variance.</p>
                  <p>E. An eligible individual who receives a variance must immediately notify the director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee in writing if the eligible individual's gross family income improves.</p>
                  <p>F. The director of the vocational rehabilitation program or designee may review the financial situation of an eligible individual who receives a variance at any time to determine whether the individual's financial situation continues to justify the variance.</p>

                  <p>Except in the circumstances described in subpart 1, an eligible individual must, with the assistance of the agency, participate in the search for and use of comparable benefits as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. Before receiving training services in a postsecondary institution, prior to the start of each school year, an eligible individual must apply for gift aid or institutional aid to pay all or part of the costs of tuition, fees, books, supplies, tools and equipment, and living expenses; and</p>
                  <p>(1) annually provide evidence to the agency of the amount of gift aid or institutional aid available to the eligible individual; or</p>
                  <p>(2) annually provide evidence to the agency that the eligible individual is not eligible for gift aid or institutional aid.</p>
                  <p>B. If gift aid or institutional aid is not available to the eligible individual because the eligible individual is in default on repayment of a student loan or has an outstanding PELL grant repayment, the agency must not participate financially in the purchase of postsecondary training services until the agency determines that a responsible repayment effort has been made. This determination must be made by the rehabilitation counselor in consultation with the eligible individual and the holder of the loan or the postsecondary institution that awarded the PELL grant, after considering such factors as the financial resources available to the eligible individual and the attempts that have been made to work out a satisfactory repayment agreement with the holder of the loan or the postsecondary institution that awarded the PELL grant. The requirement of a responsible repayment effort will be deemed to be satisfied if the eligible individual has made payments for six consecutive months.</p>
                  <p>C. Before receiving physical and mental restoration services or durable medical equipment, an eligible individual must file a claim or application with the eligible individual's health insurer, if any. If the eligible individual has no health insurance, or if the restoration services or durable medical equipment provided are not covered by the eligible individual's health insurance, the eligible individual must apply to a local human services agency for medical assistance under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 256B, or general assistance medical care under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 256D, if the agency determines that it is likely that the eligible individual may be eligible for medical assistance or general assistance medical care.</p>
                  <p>D. Before receiving any vocational rehabilitation service other than those listed in subpart 1, an eligible individual shall apply or provide evidence of having already applied for any comparable benefit that the agency determines may be available to the eligible individual. The agency must not purchase a service when the eligible individual refuses to make formal application for a comparable benefit to pay all or part of the cost of the service, or when the eligible individual refuses to accept a comparable benefit that is available to the eligible individual.</p>

                  <p>(1) a description of the business, including the product and/or service, the type of legal entity for the business, location, and hours of the business;</p>
                  <p>(2) financial data, including sources of funding, capital equipment list, balance sheet, break even analysis, net and gross income projections, and cash flow projections;</p>
                  <p>(3) a market analysis, including business competition and a marketing plan;</p>
                  <p>(4) a description of the technical and management expertise of the person or persons expected to manage and operate the business;</p>
                  <p>(5) zoning, licensing, taxation, and insurance requirements;</p>
                  <p>(6) an implementation schedule, including initial start-up costs, or a stabilization schedule including stabilization costs; and</p>
                  <p>(7) a projection of possible risks and problems along with proposed strategies for addressing them.</p>
                  <p>E. Proposed business plans must be considered as follows:</p>
                  <p>(1) For total projected expenditures that are equal to or less than the authority for local purchase given to a rehabilitation counselor by the Materials Management Division of the state Department of Administration, the agency may provide assistance only after the agency's small business development specialist has reviewed the business plan and found it to be complete, conducted a risk assessment of the business plan, and found the proposed business to be viable.</p>
                  <p>(2) For total projected expenditures that are greater than the authority for local purchase given to a rehabilitation counselor by the Materials Management Division of the state Department of Administration, the agency may provide assistance only after a state or nationally chartered lending institution or a micro-lender has reviewed the business plan and found it to be complete, conducted a risk assessment of the business plan, and found the proposed business to be viable. The lending institution or micro-lender completing the review must be separate from anyone assisting the eligible individual with the development of the business plan.</p>
                  <p>F. Total agency expenditures for the stabilization or establishment of a small business enterprise for items C, subitems (1) to (4), and J, must not exceed the lesser of:</p>
                  <p>(1) the actual amount necessary to establish or stabilize a small business enterprise; or</p>
                  <p>(2) an amount calculated annually by applying the percentage of increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, to the total agency expenditure allowed for the previous year, where 1994 was the base year, rounded to the nearest hundred dollars.</p>
                  <p>G. The agency must not pay costs associated with the ongoing operation of a business.</p>
                  <p>H. The agency must not pay any costs of bankruptcy proceedings or costs due to the bankruptcy of an eligible individual's small business enterprise.</p>
                  <p>I. A vehicle may be provided for a small business enterprise only when it is an integral part of the business and the business cannot be run without it.</p>
                  <p>J. The cost of a vehicle, if any, must be included in the total agency expenditures under item F.</p>

                  <p>A. Before the agency provides transportation services, the amount of consumer financial participation in the cost of transportation services must be determined under part 3300.5040.</p>
                  <p>B. The eligible individual must, with the assistance of the agency, participate in the search for and use of comparable benefits under part 3300.5050, subpart 2, item D, except that a search for comparable benefits is not required if the search would cause the eligible individual to lose an immediate job placement.</p>
                  <p>C. The agency must not provide transportation services unless an eligible individual is receiving one or more other vocational rehabilitation services.</p>
                  <p>D. The agency must not purchase, lease, or otherwise obtain, maintain, or insure vehicles for applicants or eligible individuals except according to subpart 11, item I.</p>
                  <p>E. If transportation provided by a public entity, including paratransit, is available and used by the eligible individual, agency payments for transportation must not exceed the actual cost of the transportation. When the public entity has more than one cost level that will meet the transportation needs of the eligible individual, the agency payments must not exceed the lowest cost level.</p>
                  <p>F. If transportation that will meet the needs of the eligible individual is available from a public entity, including paratransit, but the eligible individual chooses alternate transportation, agency payments for transportation must not exceed the lesser of the lowest cost level of transportation provided by a public entity or the cost of gasoline as determined in item G.</p>
                  <p>G. When transportation provided by a public entity, including paratransit, is unavailable and the eligible individual is being transported by personal vehicle, the agency's payments must not exceed the costs of gasoline and parking plus the cost of a driver if required. The agency's payments for gasoline costs must be determined by multiplying the mileage rate by the actual miles driven. The agency's payments for a driver must be determined by the usual and customary rate for the area.</p>
                  <p>H. The agency must limit transportation payments in support of postsecondary training to the amount that would apply if the eligible individual attended the Minnesota public institution closest to the eligible individual's residence which offers the broad field of study required by the employment plan.</p>
                  <p>I. When transportation provided by a public entity, including paratransit, and transportation by personal vehicle are unavailable, agency payments must not exceed the actual cost of the available transportation.</p>
                  <p>J. Agency purchases of vehicle repairs must be made as follows:</p>
                  <p>(1) repair to a vehicle owned by an eligible individual must not be provided unless an eligible individual would be unable to participate in vocational rehabilitation services if vehicle repair is not provided. The agency may provide vehicle repair only if no other means of transportation, such as public transportation, including paratransit, is available and the repair is necessary for the safe and legal operation of the vehicle;</p>
                  <p>(2) the agency must not provide assistance with routine vehicle maintenance;</p>
                  <p>(3) agency payments for vehicle repairs must not exceed $1,000 for an eligible individual in a 12-month period; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the agency will only pay for repairs when the vehicle is owned by the eligible individual.</p>

                  <p>B. The eligible individual must, with the assistance of the agency, participate in the search for and use of comparable benefits under part 3300.5050, subpart 2, items A, B, and D.</p>
                  <p>C. Agency payments under this subpart shall only be for the cost of books, supplies, and tools and equipment required of all students in the postsecondary training program.</p>
                  <p>D. The agency shall consider any gift aid or institutional aid in excess of tuition and fees as a comparable benefit when determining the amount the agency will pay for required books, supplies, tools and equipment, transportation, and maintenance.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">13</inline>. <b>Postsecondary training tuition and mandatory fees.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. Before the agency provides tuition and mandatory fees for postsecondary training, the amount of consumer financial participation in the cost of those services must be determined under part 3300.5040.</p>
                  <p>B. The eligible individual must, with the assistance of the agency, participate in the search for and use of comparable benefits under part 3300.5050, subpart 2, items A, B, and D.</p>
                  <p>C. The estimated cost of tuition and mandatory fees for the eligible individual's postsecondary training program must be determined annually, based on information from the postsecondary training institution. The estimated cost of tuition and mandatory fees for the eligible individual's postsecondary training during the regular academic year and the estimated costs of tuition and mandatory fees for the eligible individual's summer school postsecondary training must be determined separately, based on information from the postsecondary training institution.</p>
                  <p>D. The tuition fee schedule for an eligible individual who will attend fewer than three quarters or two semesters during the regular academic year must be prorated based on the number of quarters or semesters which the eligible individual will attend. The summer school tuition fee schedule must be prorated based on the number of summer school sessions which the eligible individual will attend if the eligible individual is attending a postsecondary institution where there are two summer school sessions.</p>
                  <p>E. The tuition fee schedule for an eligible individual enrolled in a postsecondary training program less than full time must be prorated in accordance with the specific program standards for full-time or part-time status.</p>
                  <p>F. If the undergraduate broad field of study required by the eligible individual's employment plan is not available at a Minnesota public postsecondary institution, the agency must not apply the tuition fee schedule in determining the amount of agency payments for tuition and mandatory fees.</p>
                  <p>G. The amount of gift aid or institutional aid available to the eligible individual to pay for the costs of postsecondary training must be determined annually, based on information obtained from the postsecondary training institution. The amount of gift aid or institutional aid available to the eligible individual to pay for the costs of the regular academic year must be determined separately from the amount of gift aid or institutional aid available to the eligible individual to pay for the costs of summer school, based on information obtained from the postsecondary training institution.</p>
                  <p>H. When the amount of gift aid or institutional aid equals or exceeds the cost of tuition and mandatory fees, the agency shall not pay any of the costs of tuition and mandatory fees.</p>
                  <p>I. The amount, if any, the agency will pay for the cost of tuition and mandatory fees is determined by:</p>
                  <p>(1) subtracting institutional aid from the actual cost of tuition and mandatory fees;</p>
                  <p>(2) subtracting gift aid from the remaining tuition and mandatory fees or the tuition fee schedule, if applicable, whichever is less; and</p>
                  <p>(3) subtracting consumer financial participation from the balance.</p>
                  <p>J. Regardless of the provisions in items A to I and subpart 12a, the agency must make payments for tuition and mandatory fees, and for books, supplies, and tools and equipment for postsecondary training only to the extent that the agency payments do not reduce the amount of gift aid or institutional aid available to the eligible individual.</p>
                  <p>K. The agency does not require an eligible individual to accept self-help aid. The eligible individual has the right to accept or reject a postsecondary training institution's offer of self-help aid. When the agency assistance results in a reduction of eligibility for self-help aid from a postsecondary training institution, the eligible individual may choose whether to accept the agency assistance in full or in part, or to accept the self-help aid.</p>
                  <p>L. The agency must only fund training at schools and/or programs that are licensed, registered, or exempt from licensing or registration requirements by, as appropriate:</p>
                  <p>(1) the Minnesota Office of Higher Education;</p>
                  <p>(2) the Minnesota Board of Barbers and Cosmetology Examiners;</p>
                  <p>(3) the Minnesota Department of Public Safety;</p>
                  <p>(4) the Minnesota Department of Transportation;</p>
                  <p>(5) the Minnesota Department of Commerce; or</p>
                  <p>(6) if the eligible individual is attending a postsecondary training program that is not in Minnesota, an equivalent agency in the state where the school is located.</p>

                  <p>A provider must deliver extended employment services in the extended employment program using person-centered practices. "Person-centered practices" means practices that help an individual set goals and develop action steps that enhance the individual's quality of life, where control over decisions rests with the individual. The provider must not influence an individual's decision making but instead serve as a facilitator of decision making.</p>

                  <p>A provider must consider employment first in delivering extended employment services in the extended employment program.

                  <p>A. The provider must facilitate an individual's ability to make an informed choice about the individual's employment. "Informed choice" means the individual is able to make decisions regarding the individual's employment. Informed choice requires:</p>
                  <p>(1) that the individual understands all employment options, methods to overcome barriers to employment, and the potential risks and benefits of those decisions;</p>
                  <p>(2) employment options that are not limited to disability-specific programs;</p>
                  <p>(3) community resources and supports are included in options; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the individual is provided community-based experiences on which to base employment choices on an ongoing basis using person-centered practices.</p>
                  <p>B. For an individual required to participate in a career counseling, information, and referral services consultation by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), section 511, part 397, a provider is not required to provide duplicative informed choice information for purposes of the extended employment program. A provider must consider the career counseling, information, and referral services consultation summary report when developing an individual's extended employment support plan and retain a copy in the case record.</p>

                  <p>A. If a community rehabilitation provider submits evidence of any of the circumstances listed in item B, the commissioner must grant funding under the extended employment program even if the requirements for funding in subpart 1 are not met. Funding under this subpart is only valid for up to one year and cannot be used in any two consecutive fiscal years.</p>
                  <p>B. The following are special circumstances warranting grant funding:</p>
                  <p>(1) CARF cannot schedule a timely survey;</p>
                  <p>(2) CARF has completed a survey but has not delivered the results of the survey to the provider; or</p>
                  <p>(3) an extraordinary and catastrophic circumstance has occurred. For the purposes of this part, an "extraordinary and catastrophic circumstance" means a fire or other natural disaster that is beyond the control of a provider that has adversely affected or completely halted operations such that the extended employment provider has been unable to maintain the requirements for funding.</p>
                  <p>C. If a community rehabilitation provider is not a current extended employment provider and has been awarded a contract for new or expanded extended employment services and is in compliance with all requirements for funding except the requirement for accreditation by CARF, then the commissioner must grant funding under the extended employment program even if the CARF requirement for funding in subpart 1 is not met. If the provider is not accredited by CARF, the provider must demonstrate the likelihood that the provider will meet the requirements for accreditation by CARF and will receive accreditation within one year.</p>

                  <p>A. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, the commissioner must reduce each provider's center-based employment subprogram contract allocation as described in this subpart. The basis for each provider's reduction each year is the provider's fiscal year 2020 center-based employment subprogram contract allocation.</p>
                  <p>B. A provider may shift the funds reduced from the center-based employment subprogram to either its community employment subprogram contract allocation or its supported employment subprogram contract allocation. The provider may also forfeit the funds. Of the funds reduced from the center-based employment subprogram allocation each year, no more than 50 percent of the funds can be shifted to the community employment subprogram.</p>
                  <p>(1) In fiscal year 2021, a provider's center-based employment subprogram contract allocation must be reduced by at least five percent of the provider's center-based employment subprogram fiscal year 2020 contract allocation.</p>
                  <p>(2) In fiscal year 2022, a provider's center-based employment subprogram contract allocation must be reduced by at least 15 percent of the provider's center-based employment subprogram fiscal year 2020 contract allocation.</p>
                  <p>(3) In fiscal year 2023, a provider's center-based employment subprogram contract allocation must be reduced by at least 20 percent of the provider's center-based employment subprogram fiscal year 2020 contract allocation.</p>
                  <p>(4) In fiscal year 2024, a provider's center-based employment subprogram contract allocation must be reduced by at least 25 percent of the provider's center-based employment subprogram fiscal year 2020 contract allocation.</p>
                  <p>(5) In fiscal year 2025, a provider's center-based employment subprogram contract allocation must be reduced by at least 35 percent of the provider's center-based employment subprogram fiscal year 2020 contract allocation.</p>
                  <p>(6) The commissioner must not provide funding to a provider for the center-based employment subprogram in fiscal year 2026 and later.</p>

                  <p>C. An underproduction penalty means the commissioner must adjust a provider's subprogram allocation for that subprogram in the subsequent fiscal year's contract downward, except as provided by subpart 3.</p>
                  <p>D. The downward adjustment for that subprogram's allocation must be the audited subprogram production in the audited fiscal year plus five percent of the audited fiscal year's subprogram contract allocation.</p>

                  <p>A. If a provider earns 90 percent to 95 percent of a subprogram allocation, the provider is eligible for a one-year waiver from the underproduction penalty for a particular subprogram. The commissioner must provide the waiver without a request process. A provider is ineligible to receive the one-year waiver for a particular subprogram in any two consecutive fiscal years. A provider is eligible for the one-year waiver in each particular subprogram.</p>
                  <p>B. If a provider earns less than 90 percent of a subprogram allocation and demonstrates it is experiencing an extraordinary and catastrophic circumstance under this item, the commissioner may issue a catastrophic waiver from the underproduction penalty.</p>
                  <p>(1) For purposes of this subpart, an "extraordinary and catastrophic circumstance" means a fire or other natural disaster that is beyond the control of the provider that has adversely affected or completely halted operations such that extended employment individuals have been unable to work or extended employment provider staff have been unable to provide extended employment services.</p>
                  <p>(2) A provider seeking a catastrophic waiver to the contract starting point must request this variance in a manner prescribed by the commissioner and shall:</p>

                  <p>If the commissioner distributes available funds through the new or expanded services provision, the commissioner must develop and publish a request for proposals for new or expanded services. New or expanded services must only be to provide ongoing employment support services to individuals in competitive, integrated employment. Community rehabilitation providers may apply for distribution of available funds by responding to a request for proposals for new or expanded services issued by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>A. In developing the request for proposals for new or expanded extended employment services, the commissioner shall consider how to foster innovation and promote state-of-the-art best practices in providing ongoing employment support services to individuals in competitive, integrated employment. The commissioner may waive program requirements as outlined in this chapter to conduct pilot projects, foster innovation, and promote state-of-the-art best practices in competitive, integrated employment.</p>
                  <p>B. The underproduction penalty in part 3300.6040 does not apply to a new or expanded services contract allocation. A contract for new or expanded services must include production goals within identified time frames. If a provider's audited production for the new or expanded services in an audited fiscal year is less than the production goals identified in the contract for new or expanded services, the provider must develop and implement a corrective action plan to meet the goals in the contract. The commissioner must approve and monitor the corrective action plan. If the provider does not administer extended employment services according to the corrective action plan approved by the commissioner, the commissioner must withdraw allocated state funds for new and expanded services under part 3300.6055.</p>

If the issue to be considered at the hearing involves ineligibility for unemployment benefits because of a separation from employment, the notice must explain that the parties should be prepared to discuss all incidents that arose during the course of the employment that led to the separation. The notice of hearing must also include materials that provide the following information:</p>
                  <p>A. a statement that the purpose of the hearing is to take sworn testimony and other evidence on the issues involved, that the hearing is the only procedure available under the law at which a party may present evidence, and that further appeals consist of a review of the evidence submitted at the hearing;</p>

                  <p>F. a statement that subpoenas may be available to compel the participation of witnesses or the production of documents, and an explanation of the process for requesting a subpoena;</p>
                  <p>G. a statement that documents contained in the department's records, and documents submitted by the parties that will be introduced at the hearing as possible exhibits will be sent to the parties in advance of the hearing;</p>
                  <p>H. a statement that even if the applicant already received unemployment benefits, it is important to participate in the hearing, because if the applicant is held ineligible, the applicant will not be able to receive further benefits and the applicant will have to pay back the benefits already received;</p>
                  <p>I. a statement that the unemployment law judge will determine the facts based upon a preponderance of the evidence along with the statutory definition of "preponderance of the evidence";</p>
                  <p>J. a statement that a party who fails to participate in the hearing will not be allowed a rehearing unless the party can show good cause for failing to participate, along with the statutory definition of "good cause"; and</p>
                  <p>K. a statement that an applicant, if unemployed, must file weekly continued requests for unemployment benefits while the appeal is pending.</p>

                <p>The chief unemployment law judge has discretion regarding the method by which the hearing is conducted. The hearing must be conducted by an unemployment law judge as an evidence-gathering inquiry, without regard to a burden of proof. The order of presentation of evidence is determined by the unemployment law judge.</p>
                <p>Each party may present and examine witnesses and offer their own documents or other exhibits. Parties have the right to examine witnesses, object to exhibits and testimony, and cross-examine the other party's witnesses. The unemployment law judge must assist all parties in the presentation of evidence. The unemployment law judge must rule upon evidentiary objections on the record. The unemployment law judge must permit rebuttal testimony. Parties have the right to make closing statements. Closing statements may include comments based upon the evidence and arguments of law. The unemployment law judge may limit repetitious testimony and arguments.</p>
                <p>The unemployment law judge must exercise control over the hearing procedure in a manner that protects the parties' rights to a fair hearing, including the sequestration of witnesses to avoid prejudice or collusion. The unemployment law judge must ensure that all relevant facts are clearly and fully developed. The unemployment law judge may obtain testimony and other evidence from department employees and any other person the judge believes will assist the judge in reaching a proper result.</p>
                <p>Before taking testimony, the unemployment law judge must inform the parties of the following:</p>
                <p>A. that the purpose of the hearing is to take testimony and other evidence on the issues;</p>
                <p>B. that the hearing is the only opportunity available to the parties to present testimony and other evidence on the issues involved;</p>
                <p>C. an explanation of how the hearing will be conducted, including the role and obligations of the unemployment law judge;</p>
                <p>D. that the parties have the right to request that the hearing be continued so that additional witnesses and documents can be presented, by subpoena if necessary;</p>
                <p>E. that the facts will be determined upon a preponderance of the evidence, along with the statutory definition of "preponderance of the evidence";</p>
                <p>F. the statutory provision on burden of proof;</p>
                <p>G. that certain government agencies may have access to the information provided at the hearing if allowed by statute and that the information provided may be disclosed under a district court order; and</p>
                <p>H. that after the hearing is over, the unemployment law judge will issue a written decision, which will be sent to the parties by mail or electronic transmission.</p>

                <p>Only evidence received into the record of any hearing may be considered by the unemployment law judge. The parties may stipulate to the existence of any fact or the authenticity of any exhibit.</p>
                <p>All competent, relevant, and material evidence, including records and documents in the possession of the parties that are offered into evidence, are part of the hearing record. An unemployment law judge may receive any evidence that possesses probative value, including hearsay, if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable, prudent persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of their serious affairs. An unemployment law judge may exclude any evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or unduly repetitious. An unemployment law judge is not bound by statutory and common law rules of evidence. The rules of evidence may be used as a guide in determining the quality of evidence offered. An unemployment law judge may draw adverse inferences from the refusal of a party or witness to testify on the basis of any privilege. An unemployment law judge may only use reliable, probative, and substantial evidence as a basis for decision.</p>

                  <p>When determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor, five factors must be considered and weighed within a particular set of circumstances. The five factors to be considered are:</p>
                  <p>A. the right or the lack of the right to control the means and manner of performance;</p>
                  <p>B. the right to discharge the worker without incurring liability for damages;</p>
                  <p>C. the mode of payment;</p>
                  <p>D. furnishing of materials and tools; and</p>
                  <p>E. control over the premises where the services are performed.</p>
                  <p>The two most important factors are items A and B.</p>
                  <p>Other factors, not specifically identified in this part, may be considered if the outcome is inconclusive when applying the factors in items A to E. The degree of their importance may vary depending upon the occupation or work situation being considered and why the factor is present in the particular situation.</p>

                  <p>A. Licensed blind vendors must acquire ownership of merchandise and supplies through reimbursing the state licensing agency for such expenditures by monthly payments extended over a three-year period. Upon approval of the state licensing agency, additional time may be granted in hardship cases, the purpose of which is to ensure that no individual be denied the opportunity to become a licensed blind vendor because of the licensed blind vendor's inability to purchase the initial merchandise and supplies.</p>
                  <p>B. Upon termination of a licensed blind vendor's license or when a licensed blind vendor withdraws from a specific business enterprise location, the state licensing agency must purchase for the new licensed blind vendor, at cost, salable merchandise and, at an amortized price, supplies remaining in the business enterprise, assuming there is no amount owing in the departing licensed blind vendor's accounts with the state licensing agency or other outstanding financial obligations that result from a signed agreement between the state licensing agency and a location on the licensed blind vendor's behalf authorizing the placement of the vending facility or vending machines.</p>
                  <p>C. If a licensed blind vendor under contract dies, the state licensing agency must immediately take an inventory at the business enterprise. If possible, the state licensing agency must conduct this inventory with a member of the licensed blind vendor's family or a representative of the licensed blind vendor's estate. The state licensing agency must then prepare a summary accounting of the deceased licensed blind vendor's accounts with the state licensing agency. If the balance is in favor of the state licensing agency, the estate must pay that balance. If the balance is in favor of the deceased licensed blind vendor, the state licensing agency must pay the balance to the estate. The warrant must be made payable to the "Estate of [licensed blind vendor's name]."</p>
                  <p>D. A licensed blind vendor who begins to operate a business enterprise location shall determine what merchandise or supplies the licensed blind vendor will purchase from the departing licensed blind vendor. In the case of a licensed blind vendor disagreement over the purchase of supplies or merchandise, the departing licensed blind vendor may request that the state licensing agency intervene and make a final decision. The departing licensed blind vendor is responsible for disposing of all the merchandise or supply inventory not purchased by the new licensed blind vendor.</p>

                  <p>A. The state licensing agency assumes responsibility for providing licensed blind vendors the supervision, assistance, and training necessary to ensure the operation of each business enterprise in the most productive and efficient manner possible. This supervision, assistance, and training must be performed according to the following policies in addition to other provisions of parts 3321.0100 to 3321.1300.</p>
                  <p>B. In entering agreements for new or vacated business enterprises, preference on the basis of seniority of experience of operating business enterprises under the control of the state licensing agency shall be given to capable licensed blind vendors who are deemed competent to handle the business enterprise under consideration. The application of this preference must not prohibit the state licensing agency from selecting a licensed blind vendor from the community in which the business enterprise is located. No licensed blind vendor may transfer to another business enterprise and bid back into the business enterprise the licensed blind vendor just left in the same bidding sequence. Seniority must be determined on the basis of continuous service as a licensed blind vendor in the business enterprises program with the state licensing agency.</p>
                  <p>C. The state licensing agency shall determine a licensed blind vendor is in default if either of the following is more than 30 days late arriving at the offices of the state licensing agency:</p>
                  <p>(1) reports under subpart 2, item D; or</p>
                  <p>(2) payment in full under part 3321.0800.</p>
                  <p>In case of any default, the licensed blind vendor must be assessed a late fee of $25. The state licensing agency shall notify the licensed blind vendor of the default and penalty. A licensed blind vendor who is in default for the same infraction the succeeding month must be assessed a $50 late fee. This late fee charge continues to be $50 per default until the licensed blind vendor has not been in default for at least one month. A licensed blind vendor who is in default twice within six months will not be permitted to transfer to new or vacated vending facilities, after notice of disqualification from the state licensing agency. The licensed blind vendor may regain eligibility to transfer if the licensed blind vendor has cured any prior default and has not been in default for six consecutive months after the prior defaults have been cured.</p>
                  <p>D. A leave of absence for medical reasons, supported by a doctors statement, may be granted by the state licensing agency and management committee, and the licensed blind vendor shall continue to accrue seniority during the leave. A medical leave of absence for up to six months may be granted under a plan in which the requesting licensed blind vendor retains responsibility for and general management of the current business enterprise. A medical leave up to one year may also be granted under a plan in which the licensed blind vendor permanently gives up all responsibility for and rights to the current business enterprise. A doctor's statement of ability to return to work is required before a licensed blind vendor's actual return to a business enterprise. Upon returning from a one-year medical leave of absence, the licensed blind vendor must comply with part 3321.0300, subpart 1, item E. Prior to entering into a new agreement with the licensed blind vendor who is returning from the one-year medical leave of absence, the state licensing agency must evaluate the licensed blind vendor to ensure continued compliance with part 3321.0200, item C. If necessary, the state licensing agency must provide additional training to a licensed blind vendor to meet this standard before entering into a new agreement.</p>
                  <p>E. A general leave of absence may be granted by the state licensing agency and management committee during which time the licensed blind vendor shall not accrue seniority but may exercise seniority rights for new or vacated business enterprises. The licensed blind vendor shall retain seniority accrued up to the date of the leave. A licensed blind vendor on general leave shall give up all rights to the business enterprise which they are operating. Prior to entering into a new agreement with the licensed blind vendor who is returning from a general leave of absence, the state licensing agency must evaluate the licensed blind vendor to ensure continued compliance with part 3321.0200, item C. If necessary, the state licensing agency must provide additional training to a licensed blind vendor to meet this standard before entering into a new agreement.</p>
                  <p>F. The wages paid by a licensed blind vendor for any assistance employed, including bookkeeping, must be in reasonable proportion to work performed and must be approved by the state licensing agency.</p>
                  <p>G. The state licensing agency shall approve the items and the selling prices at which those items may be sold, which comprise the merchandise inventory at each business enterprise.</p>
                  <p>H. The state licensing agency must purchase liability insurance for a business enterprise only when, in the opinion of the state licensing agency, it is deemed essential that the state licensing agency purchase this insurance.</p>
                  <p>I. The state licensing agency shall review all licensed blind vendor monthly reports, statements and invoices, and other information with specific attention to expenses and take those steps necessary to ensure licensed blind vendor payment of those expenses.</p>

                  <p>An opportunity for an informal administrative review must be afforded to each licensed blind vendor dissatisfied with any action arising from the operation or administration of the business enterprise program. The procedures in items A to D must be followed in granting licensed blind vendors an informal administrative review.</p>
                  <p>A. A licensed blind vendor or the licensed blind vendor's designee (who need not be an attorney) may request an informal administrative review. This request must be in writing to the director of the state licensing agency within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of the action and must state the specific action with which the licensed blind vendor is dissatisfied. This informal administrative review must be conducted by supervisory staff of the state licensing agency who have not in any way participated in the state licensing agency action in question.</p>
                  <p>B. The informal administrative review must be held during regular agency working hours, at a district or local office location. An informal administrative review must be conducted within 30 calendar days of receipt by the state licensing agency of the written request.</p>
                  <p>C. Documentation as to written requests for informal administrative review and actions and decisions resulting therefrom shall be maintained as part of the official record of the informal administrative review process.</p>
                  <p>D. If an informal administrative review does not resolve a dispute to the satisfaction of a licensed blind vendor, the licensed blind vendor may request that the state licensing agency provide a full evidentiary hearing.</p>

                  <p>An opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing conducted pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14, must be afforded to each licensed blind vendor dissatisfied with any action arising from the operation or administration of the business enterprises program. The procedures in items A to F must be followed in granting licensed blind vendors a full evidentiary hearing.</p>
                  <p>A. If a licensed blind vendor requests a full evidentiary hearing, the request must be made either within 15 calendar days after an adverse decision based on an informal administrative review or, in the absence of an informal administrative review, within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of the state licensing agency action with which the licensed blind vendor is dissatisfied.</p>
                  <p>B. A licensed blind vendor or the licensed blind vendor's designee must request a full evidentiary hearing in writing. This written request must be transmitted to the director of the state licensing agency. The request must specify the action being appealed.</p>
                  <p>C. The full evidentiary hearing shall be held at a time and place convenient and accessible to the licensed blind vendor requesting a full evidentiary hearing. A full evidentiary hearing held during regular state licensing agency working hours and located at the state licensing agency central office must be deemed among the convenient times and places. Upon receipt of the request, the state licensing agency shall immediately request a hearing date from the state Office of Administrative Hearings, whose designee shall serve as the administrative law judge, and then notify the licensed blind vendor of the time and place for the full evidentiary hearing. The licensed blind vendor must be provided sufficient preparation time before the full evidentiary hearing. The licensed blind vendor shall be provided a copy of the hearing procedures and rules.</p>
                  <p>D. The licensed blind vendor has the right to be represented by counsel, and may present witnesses and cross-examine adverse witnesses.</p>
                  <p>E. A transcript of the proceeding must be available to the licensed blind vendor.</p>
                  <p>F. After receipt of the report of the administrative law judge, the director of the state licensing agency shall issue a final written decision within 15 calendar days.</p>

                <p>An applicant is eligible for rehabilitation services under the vocational rehabilitation program only if a vocational rehabilitation counselor determines that the conditions of either item A or B are met.</p>
                <p>A. The applicant has a visual impairment and meets the following conditions:</p>
                <p>(1) the visual impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment for the applicant; and</p>
                <p>(2) a vocational rehabilitation counselor determines that the applicant requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, or regain employment consistent with the applicant's unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice.</p>
                <p>If the applicant meets both requirements, SSB shall presume the applicant can benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services in terms of employment, unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome. Prior to any determination that an applicant is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome because of the severity of the applicant's impairment, SSB must conduct a trial work experience pursuant to part 3325.0145, or if the applicant cannot take advantage of a trial work experience, an extended evaluation pursuant to part 3325.0150.</p>
                <p>B. The applicant has been determined eligible for Social Security benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act based upon a visual impairment, in which case the applicant is presumed eligible consistent with Code of Federal Regulations, title 34, section 361.42 (a)(3).</p>
                <p>The determination of eligibility must be made within 60 days of receipt of an application unless documentation supports:</p>
                <p>(1) exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of SSB precludes making an eligibility determination within 60 days and SSB and the individual agree to a specific extension of time;</p>
                <p>(2) a trial work experience is required pursuant to part 3325.0145 regarding the presumption that the applicant can benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services; or</p>
                <p>(3) an extended evaluation is required pursuant to part 3325.0150 regarding the presumption that the applicant can benefit from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services.</p>

                  <p>B. Subject to subparts 3 to 14 and informed choice, SSB must ensure that each eligible individual receives only the available rehabilitation services necessary to enable the eligible individual to achieve the eligible individual's employment or independent living outcome except:</p>
                  <p>(1) SSB must not provide a rehabilitation service, other than a diagnostic assessment service, to an eligible individual unless the service is identified in the IPE or ILCSR; and</p>
                  <p>(2) SSB must not provide a rehabilitation service to an eligible individual if the eligible individual's school district is legally obligated to provide the service consistent with an interagency agreement with the Minnesota Department of Education that identifies each party's roles, responsibilities, and financial obligations.</p>
                  <p>C. Only in the most unusual of circumstances may a family member be a vendor or provider of services to the individual, and then only with prior supervisory approval.</p>

                  <p>Items A to C govern the provision of orientation and mobility services.</p>
                  <p>A. SSB must provide outdoor cane travel instruction to an eligible individual who is legally blind unless:</p>
                  <p>(1) the eligible individual is not expected to travel alone outside the eligible individual's residence because of one or more severe nonvisual disabilities; or</p>
                  <p>(2) the eligible individual and an orientation and mobility specialist or a person described in item B determine that the eligible individual can travel safely and independently outside the eligible individual's residence without receiving outdoor cane travel instruction.</p>
                  <p>B. Travel techniques for purposes of outdoor travel must be taught by an orientation and mobility specialist or a person who has demonstrated a mastery of the travel techniques used by blind persons and the ability to safely and effectively teach these techniques to others. The provision of outdoor travel techniques to eligible individuals who are legally blind and have multiple impairments, such as legal blindness combined with hearing loss, may require additional expertise. The director must determine whether a person is qualified in these areas by considering all of the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(1) the person's education;</p>
                  <p>(2) the person's prior experience in rehabilitation; and</p>

                  <p>C. Orientation and mobility training of an eligible individual must give the eligible individual an opportunity to travel without the instructor and on increasingly difficult routes to help the eligible individual develop confidence in the eligible individual's ability to travel independently. Orientation and mobility training of legally blind eligible individuals who have some remaining vision must include the use of sleepshades unless an orientation and mobility specialist or a person described in item B determines that because of age or one or more nonvisual disabilities the use of sleepshades would be unsafe.</p>

                  <p>Items A to C govern the provision of transportation services.</p>
                  <p>A. SSB may provide transportation services only for transportation requirements that are necessary to enable an applicant or eligible individual to be determined eligible for or participate in the vocational rehabilitation or independent living program.</p>
                  <p>B. SSB must provide the least expensive mode of transportation that serves the eligible individual's rehabilitation needs and accommodates any nonvisual disability related limitations the eligible individual may have. When a private vehicle is the mode of transportation identified in the eligible individual's plan, SSB must pay parking fees and mileage at the rate established for state of Minnesota employees in the current managerial plan published by the Minnesota Department of Management and Budget. This document is incorporated by reference and is not subject to frequent change. It is available for inspection at SSB's headquarters office.</p>
                  <p>C. SSB must pay for the transportation of an escort to accompany the eligible individual while traveling only if the eligible individual cannot yet travel safely without the assistance of an escort.</p>

                  <p>This subpart governs the provision of rehabilitation technology-assistive technology services.</p>
                  <p>A. The provision of rehabilitation technology-assistive technology services must be followed by training in the use of assistive technology by an individual qualified to provide rehabilitation technology-assistive technology services.</p>
                  <p>B. Rehabilitation technology-assistive technology training services must be provided by a person who has demonstrated a mastery of rehabilitation technology-assistive technology services and the ability to teach assistive technology to blind or deafblind persons. Rehabilitation technology-assistive technology services include:</p>
                  <p>(1) using screen reader (via speech or braille output) or screen magnification programs to access an operating system, word processing, e-mail, and Internet browser applications; and</p>
                  <p>(2) operating other current or emerging electronic aids and devices.</p>
                  <p>C. The director must determine whether a person is qualified in these areas by considering all of the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(1) the person's education;</p>
                  <p>(2) the person's prior experience in rehabilitation; and</p>

Before receiving any rehabilitation service other than those identified in subpart 1, items A to F, an eligible individual must apply or provide evidence of having already applied for any state or federal assistance program for which the eligible individual's vocational rehabilitation counselor determines the eligible individual may be eligible.</p>
                  <p>C. Before receiving vocational training services in an institution of higher learning, an eligible individual must apply for educational grants to cover the costs of tuition, supplies, and living expenses.</p>
                  <p>D. If comparable services and benefits exist under any other program, but are not available to the eligible individual at the time needed to ensure the progress of the individual toward achieving the employment outcome in the individual's IPE, SSB must provide vocational rehabilitation services until those comparable services and benefits become available.</p>

                  <p>An eligible individual who is unable to pay for rehabilitation services to the extent required by subparts 4 and 5 because of unusual financial circumstances in relation to family income may apply to the director for a variance in the determination of the eligible individual's required financial participation as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. A request for a variance must be submitted in writing by the eligible individual or the eligible individual's designated representative. The request must provide the director with evidence describing the eligible individual's unusual financial situation. If additional information is required by the director to determine eligibility for a variance, SSB must, within 15 calendar days after receiving the written request, inform the eligible individual in writing of the specific additional information required.</p>
                  <p>B. The director must determine whether the eligible individual is eligible for a variance and notify the eligible individual of the determination in writing within 30 calendar days after the director receives all the information required under item A. The written notification must:</p>
                  <p>(1) specify whether the eligible individual is eligible for a variance;</p>
                  <p>(2) indicate the reasons for the determination;</p>
                  <p>(3) specify the amount of the variance, if any;</p>
                  <p>(4) inform the eligible individual of review and appeal rights under part 3325.0478; and</p>
                  <p>(5) be signed and dated by the director.</p>
                  <p>C. The director must grant a variance only if the eligible individual demonstrates that it would be impossible for the eligible individual to make the cost contributions required under subparts 5 and 6 without using the eligible individual's savings because of:</p>
                  <p>(1) court ordered financial obligations of the eligible individual;</p>
                  <p>(2) legal financial obligations incurred by the eligible individual prior to being found eligible to receive rehabilitation services from SSB; or</p>
                  <p>(3) extraordinary expenditures for necessities such as food, shelter, clothing, or medical care the eligible individual is required to make because of illness or disability.</p>
                  <p>D. The director must determine the amount of an eligible individual's variance by:</p>
                  <p>(1) calculating the sum of the eligible individual's financial obligations and extraordinary expenditures identified in item C which make it impossible for the eligible individual to make the cost contributions required under subparts 5 and 6; and</p>
                  <p>(2) subtracting that sum from the financial participation amount the eligible individual would have to pay without the variance.</p>
                  <p>E. An eligible individual who receives a variance must immediately notify the director in writing if the eligible individual's financial situation improves.</p>
                  <p>F. The director may review the financial situation of an eligible individual who receives a variance at any time to determine whether the eligible individual's financial situation continues to justify the variance.</p>

                  <p>An appellant may request mediation at any time. Mediation must not be used to deny the right of an appellant to pursue an impartial hearing.</p>
                  <p>A. Participation in the mediation process is voluntary on the part of the appellant and on the part of SSB. The appellant, SSB, or mediator may terminate mediation at any time. In the event mediation is terminated, the appellant or SSB may pursue resolution through an impartial hearing.</p>
                  <p>B. A qualified and impartial mediator who meets the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, title 34, section 361.5(b)(43), must be chosen on a random basis, by mutual agreement of the director of SSB and the appellant or, as appropriate, the appellant's designated representative, or in accordance with SSB's procedure for assigning mediators in a neutral manner. Mediation sessions must be held in a timely manner and at a location convenient to both parties.</p>
                  <p>C. Mediation discussions are confidential and may not be used as evidence in any subsequent due process hearings or civil proceedings, and the parties may be required to sign a confidentiality pledge prior to the commencement of mediation. Any agreement resulting from mediation must be in writing with the assistance of the mediator, signed by both parties, and copies provided to both parties. SSB must pay for the cost of mediation, but is not required to pay for any costs related to the representation of an appellant.</p>

                  <p>An appellant may choose an impartial hearing.</p>
                  <p>A. The impartial hearing officer for a particular case must be selected on a random basis from a list of qualified impartial hearing officers who have been jointly identified by SSB and the State Rehabilitation Council for the Blind.</p>
                  <p>B. The hearing must be initiated and conducted according to parts 1400.5100 to 1400.8400; Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.57 to 14.62; and Code of Federal Regulations, title 34, part 361.57 (e).</p>
                  <p>C. The impartial hearing officer must provide by mail to both parties a full written report of the findings and grounds for the decision within 30 calendar days of the completion of the hearing. The impartial hearing officer's decision is final unless a review is requested under item D.</p>
                  <p>D. A party may request a review of the impartial hearing officer's decision using the following process:</p>
                  <p>(1) A party who is dissatisfied with the impartial hearing officer's decision may request a review of the decision within 20 calendar days of the mailing of the impartial hearing officer's decision. The review must be conducted by the commissioner of employment and economic development, who may not delegate the review to any employee of SSB.</p>
                  <p>(2) The commissioner must provide both parties with an opportunity to submit additional evidence and information relevant to a final decision concerning the matter under review.</p>
                  <p>(3) The commissioner may not overturn or modify the impartial hearing officer's decision, or any part of the decision, that supports the position of the appellant unless the commissioner concludes, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the decision of the impartial hearing officer is clearly erroneous on the basis of being contrary to the approved state plan, federal law and regulations, or state rules and policies that are consistent with federal requirements.</p>
                  <p>(4) The commissioner must make an independent, final decision within 30 calendar days of the request after reviewing the entire hearing record and provide the decision in writing, including a full report of the findings and the statutory, regulatory, or policy grounds for the decision to both parties.</p>
                  <p>(5) The commissioner's decision is final unless either party disagrees and brings a civil action, in which case the commissioner's decision must be implemented pending review by the court.</p>
                  <p>(6) Any party dissatisfied with the commissioner's decision after reviewing the impartial hearing officer's decision may bring a civil action with respect to the matter in dispute in any state court of competent jurisdiction or district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, as provided in Code of Federal Regulations, title 34, section 361.57 (i).</p>

In all cases, not more than four payment requests shall be submitted for the life of the project.

                <p>For projects funded with state grant funds, the Community Development Division shall reimburse the applicant for the eligible costs represented by each payment request, provided that the payment request documentation submitted contains the documentation required in the project agreement.</p>
                <p>The final payment shall reflect any cost adjustments due to project changes. The project site shall be subject to an inspection by state and federal personnel. All costs incurred by the applicant may be subject to verification by an independent federal or state audit.</p>

                  <p>C. Each RDC shall submit to the agency a completion report at the end of the fiscal year. This report shall indicate which work elements were not completed and which objectives were and were not achieved. For each work element and objective not successfully completed, the RDC shall provide an explanation of such as well as an indication of the amount of time needed to complete the remaining activity.</p>
                  <p>D. No sooner than 30 days after the completion of the fiscal year, the agency shall determine, based on its review of the RDC completion report, whether or not the work program has been completed in an acceptable manner and whether or not the grant agreement between the agency and the RDC has been fulfilled.</p>

                  <p>These rules provide an optional procedure to assist a person who, before undertaking a project which would use the state's air, land, or water resources, must obtain more than one state permit as defined by these rules when that person voluntarily decides to use this procedure. The assistance involves identifying all such required permits before the project is implemented; providing a single hearing on appropriate permit applications; providing time frames for the making of agency decisions; and providing to the applicant statements of the reasons that agencies approve or deny the permit applications.</p>

                  <p>A person proposing a project that might require more than one permit may, before the initial construction of the project or the initial operation of the project if construction of the project requires no permits, submit to the coordination unit a master application requesting the issuance of all permits necessary for construction and (or) operation of the project.</p>
                  <p>Other permits, in addition to those defined by these rules, may be included in these permit coordination procedures if the applicant and state regulatory agency so agree and if such procedure is permissible under the statutes and regulations that apply to such nonincluded permits. A written agreement to such an arrangement shall be provided by the agency to the coordination unit within 30 days of receipt by the agency of the master application. If such other permit applications are included within the master application process, they shall remain with the process until final disposition of the master application and for purposes of the master application process shall be included as a permit as defined by these rules.</p>
                  <p>If a permit is required for the operation of a project or if a state agency must approve the engineering design plans of a project, and if the information needed by the agency to reach a decision could not be made available through the master application process, because postconstruction or operation data are required to be collected or evaluated or because the issuance of the permit depends upon a postconstruction facilities inspection or performance demonstration, then that permit or approval may be processed independently from the master application process provided both the applicant and the agency agree.</p>

                  <p>The coordination unit shall provide certification application forms which shall be submitted respectively by all applicants as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. Certification must be obtained, from the local government units in which the proposed project will be located, that the project complies with all local zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, and environmental rules administered by the local government unit. Certification under this item must be issued not more than 120 days before the submission date of the master application. The local government units shall either issue a certification or deny that certification in accord with the following procedures:</p>
                  <p>(1) Within 45 days after the applicant has submitted a certification application form to the local government unit, the unit shall return the completed form to the applicant or notify the applicant in writing that the certification is denied, including the reasons for the denial.</p>
                  <p>(2) No local government unit shall rescind such a certification for a master application, even though the local government may have changed its zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, or environmental regulations. A change of zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, or environmental rules shall not invalidate a previously given certification for the purpose of securing a state permit under parts 4350.3000 to 4350.3130. After certification, the local government may change such zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, or environmental rules, but not so as to affect the proposed project until the procedures of parts 4350.3000 to 4350.3130, including any administrative or judicial reviews, are completed.</p>
                  <p>(3) A local government unit denial of certification shall not be appealable under these rules. Such denial shall not preclude the applicant from filing a permit application under any other available statute or procedure.</p>
                  <p>B. Certification must be obtained from the board that an environmental impact statement on the project either has been completed or is not required. Within five days after the first board meeting following submission of a certification application form to the board, the board shall return the completed form or notify the applicant in writing that the proposed project is undergoing review under the environmental review process. If the project is undergoing review under the environmental review process, the board shall return a completed form to the applicant within ten days after such process is completed. If an environmental impact statement was required on the project, a copy of the final environmental impact statement shall be attached to the board's certification.</p>

                  <p>A notified agency that makes a timely response indicating that a permit is not required, or that fails to make a timely response concerning a permit program or programs, shall not require such a permit of the applicant for the described project unless:</p>

                  <p>C. unusual circumstances prevented the agency from notifying the coordination unit, and the agency can establish that failure to require a permit would result in substantial harm to the public health and welfare.</p>

Included with the agency's request shall be a statement justifying the need to require the additional permits. The board at its first meeting held more than 15 days after being notified by the agency shall determine whether the permits shall be required. If additional permits are required because one of the conditions of subpart 8, item A occurs necessitating a change in the notice required by part 4350.3060, subpart 1, the applicant shall pay the additional cost, if any, resulting from the requirement for the additional permits. Any other costs resulting from the conditions in subpart 8, items A to C will be borne by the agencies requiring additional permits.</p>
