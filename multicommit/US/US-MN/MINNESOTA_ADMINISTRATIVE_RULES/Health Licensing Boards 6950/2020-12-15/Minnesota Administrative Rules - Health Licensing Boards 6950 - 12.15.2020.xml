                <p>A regulated person with personal knowledge of an exposure incident must ensure that the exposed patient, and with the patient's permission, the patient's primary health care provider, are informed of the exposure incident and that the patient is offered assistance in securing follow-up care immediately or as soon as possible after the patient is subjected to an exposure incident. If the exposure incident occurs in a health care setting that has written procedures regarding exposure incidents and the procedures require patient notification of the exposure incident and the offer of assistance to the patient in securing follow-up care, the regulated person meets the requirements of this part by notifying the official designated in the written procedures charged with the responsibility for carrying out the procedures. A regulated person must not disclose to a patient who is subjected to an exposure incident the identity of the source unless the source has explicitly given authorization for release of identity.</p>
