                <p>Any party to a jurisdictional controversy proceeding may request a reconsideration or clarification of the determination of the labor referee, on any or all of the following grounds: that there is material evidence newly discovered, which, with reasonable diligence, could not be found or produced at the prior hearings; that the determination is not justified by the evidence; that any adverse party has been guilty of misconduct which materially affected the result. Such request shall be in writing and shall set forth the facts upon which it is based. Copies of such request shall be served on all other parties to the proceeding and upon the labor referee. The labor referee may then proceed to consider the request if the referee deems the grounds stated sufficient, or may reject the same on deeming the grounds insufficient. On determining to consider the request, the labor referee shall order a preliminary hearing thereon, notice of which shall be given as provided for the first hearing upon such jurisdictional controversy. After such hearing the labor referee shall make an order granting or denying the request. If the request is granted, the labor referee shall proceed to reconsider or clarify the determination and shall fix a time and place for hearing thereon, of which notice shall be given as for the first hearing. The labor referee may by order limit the matters upon which the referee will receive new or additional evidence. Thereupon, further proceedings shall be had as upon the original notice or jurisdictional controversy. At the conclusion thereof, the labor referee shall affirm the determination or shall make and file an amended determination which shall supersede the original determination.</p>

                <p>Any party to the dispute may be represented by a representative or an attorney at law. The first party requesting any action shall be called the moving party. The other party shall be called the defending party. Each party shall have the right to cross-examine the witnesses of the other party. The order of the proceedings shall be as follows: the moving party shall outline that party's case, call witnesses, and present evidence; upon the completion of the case of the moving party, the defending party shall outline that party's case, call witnesses, and present evidence. The opportunity to call witnesses in rebuttal shall be accorded to each party. Exhibits may be offered by either party and when received in evidence by the board shall be made a part of the record. After the parties have concluded the presentation of their evidence, they may make arguments in the same order as hereinbefore provided for submission of evidence, and thereupon the hearings shall be closed. All proceedings and the record thereof shall be confidential unless both parties agree in writing to the release thereof by the board. No member of the board shall present the case or examine the witnesses of any party to the dispute except so far as such examination may be necessary to amplify the testimony disclosed by the examination by the parties to the dispute.</p>

The board may, however, make any independent inspection of the subject matter of the dispute, or make such inquiries or obtain such information outside of the hearings as it may deem necessary and proper; provided, however, that the parties to the dispute shall be afforded an opportunity to examine any evidence so secured, and to introduce evidence in opposition thereto, unless the right to such examination and introduction of evidence is waived in writing. The parties shall furnish such evidence as the board may require, as far as possible and the failure to produce such evidence when required may be considered by the board in making its award. The board may, at its discretion, receive written briefs, and shall fix at the close of the hearings the time within which the same shall be served upon the opposing parties and filed with proof of such service.</p>

                <p>The right of any employee to vote at an election held for the purpose of determining the representative of employees may be challenged by any authorized challenger designated as provided by part 5505.1000 or by any employee entitled to vote at the election. The person making the challenge shall state fully the grounds thereof and a record thereof shall be made by the agent conducting the election. The agent shall then examine the challenged employee as to the employee's qualifications for voting and shall make a record thereof. If the challenge be not then withdrawn, and the challenged employee shall insist on voting, the employee shall be permitted to vote upon filing with the agent a statement in writing, signed by the employee and witnessed by the agent, alleging that he or she is eligible to vote and setting forth the employee's qualifications. Ballots so received shall not be marked or otherwise distinguished from the other ballots cast. The agent conducting the election shall transmit the record of the proceedings upon all challenges to the commissioner with the returns of the election. If it appears therefrom that the number of challenged votes is sufficient to have affected the result of the election, the commissioner shall hold a hearing on the question after notice to the challenged voters, to the persons or organizations voted upon as representatives, and to other parties, if any, to whom notice of the election was given. The commissioner shall thereupon determine whether or not the respective challenged voters were eligible to vote and whether or not the result of the election might have been affected by votes cast by ineligible persons. On finding that the result of the election might have been so affected, the commissioner may declare the election void and proceed further, as though no election had been held.</p>

                  <p>E. Cross-examination of witnesses is conducted in a sequence determined by the commissioner.</p>
                  <p>F. When all parties and witnesses have been heard, final argument may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be permitted. The commissioner shall determine the timing and sequence of the argument, and whether the argument is presented in written or oral form, or both.</p>

                  <p>A $10-per-day penalty shall be the only penalty for late notice of a desire to negotiate a subsequent labor contract and may be imposed by the commissioner upon request by a party adversely affected by the failure to provide timely notice or the commissioner's own motion. A request or motion to assess a penalty shall be made in writing and served upon the commissioner and the other party to the labor contract within ten days of the requesting party's first knowledge of the other party's desire to negotiate or, in the case of the commissioner's own motion, within 15 days of the receipt of a request for mediation assistance involving the same parties and contract. A request from a party or motion by the commissioner shall specify the date of first knowledge of the desire to negotiate, the expiration date of the current labor contract, and a brief statement of the adverse results or impact of the late notice. Upon receipt of a written request or after the commissioner's own motion to assess a penalty for late notice, the commissioner shall investigate the matter pursuant to part 5510.1910. If the commissioner finds that the late notice did not prejudice the commissioner or the other party, the commissioner may waive all or a part of the penalty. The penalty shall be payable to the state of Minnesota general fund. The amount of the penalty and its waiver is not subject to appeal.</p>

                  <p>A. in the case of essential employees, either or both parties have requested arbitration; or</p>
                  <p>B. in the case of nonessential employees, a request to arbitrate has been made by one party and has been agreed to by the other within 15 days of the request.</p>
                  <p>Requests for arbitration and agreements to arbitrate must be in writing and be served on the other party and the commissioner under part 5510.0310, subpart 19. The requests and agreements are binding on the parties except to the extent they otherwise agree in writing. An offer to arbitrate for nonessential employees that has not been accepted in writing within the 15-day period shall be considered rejected and withdrawn.</p>

                  <p>When an agreement or requirement to arbitrate has been established, and the commissioner has determined the items to be submitted to arbitration, the commissioner shall certify the matters to arbitration and direct each party to submit their final position on the items certified by the commissioner. Final positions shall be presented in the form of the contract language desired by each party to resolve the matter in dispute. Final positions must be submitted to the commissioner within 15 days of the date of certification. The deadline for submitting final positions may be extended a reasonable period of time by the commissioner upon an adequate and timely showing of good cause by a party.</p>
                  <p>If the arbitration form is a final offer variety, the final positions of the parties may not be withdrawn or amended except by mutual written consent or to correct nonsubstantive errors of a clerical-technical nature or matters solely of form. When final positions have been received from both parties, the commissioner shall provide each party with a copy of the opposing party's final positions. The commissioner may provide copies of final positions to the arbitrator, but part 5510.2905, subpart 2, shall govern the protected nature of the final positions.</p>

The failure of a party to submit timely final positions in a conventional arbitration matter shall be noted by the arbitration panel or arbitrator and may be considered by the panel or arbitrator in weighing the testimony, evidence, and overall good faith behavior of that party with respect to the items before the panel or arbitrator.</p>

                  <p>All grant recipients must arrange for and undergo a financial and compliance audit at least once every two years. The audits must be performed by qualified individuals who are independent of those persons who authorize, manage, and carry out the expenditure of funds to ensure unbiased opinions, conclusions, or judgments. Grant recipients are responsible for arranging and paying for these audits. The purpose of the audit is to report on whether:</p>
                  <p>A. the financial operations have been conducted properly;</p>
                  <p>B. financial and other reports submitted as a part of the program have been presented fairly and accurately;</p>
                  <p>C. the grantee has complied with applicable laws, regulations, and policies;</p>
                  <p>D. resources are used and managed in an economic and efficient manner; and</p>
                  <p>E. program objectives and results are being effectively and economically achieved.</p>
                  <p>Normal accepted auditing methods and standards must be applied in the performance of this audit. Should an auditor become aware of irregularities in financial or programmatic performance, the auditor must promptly notify the commissioner of those irregularities and, if appropriate, higher grantee management officials than the level at which irregularities appear to lie.</p>

                  <p>It is the responsibility of the arbitrator to schedule time commitments in a manner consistent with the needs of the parties and the expeditious handling of disputes. The arbitrator must adhere to the time limits of Minnesota Statutes, section 179A.16, and the parties' arbitration procedure. When initially accepting and scheduling a case, or at the first reasonable opportunity to become aware of the time limits, the arbitrator must indicate whether or not the applicable time limits will present a problem in the timely handling of the case. Although the time limits specified in a grievance arbitration procedure may be waived or extended by the parties, it is improper for an arbitrator to routinely request or suggest extensions. If, after accepting and hearing a case, the arbitrator is unable to render an award within the time limits specified in the grievance arbitration procedure, the arbitrator shall notify each party in writing of the reason for the delay and shall seek approval for establishing an alternate date for completion of the award. A request for an extension of the timeline for an interest arbitration award must be submitted directly to the commissioner.</p>

When the parties' arbitration agreement provides for panels of fewer than seven names, the parties may use the striking procedures in subpart 5 to reduce the size of a seven-member panel. In assembling panels, the commissioner shall use a random selection system that results in a reasonably equal number of opportunities for referral among roster members who have been on the roster for three or more years. When possible, no more than three arbitrators who have been on the roster for less than three years shall be included on a single panel, but the commissioner shall provide greater referral opportunities for those individuals. In assembling panels, the commissioner shall seek to avoid potential conflicts of interest and shall include or exclude roster members pursuant to mutual requests of the parties. Geographic location or unique and special circumstances and technical expertise must be considered by the commissioner when the parties request that those factors be considered.
