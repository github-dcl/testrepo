The patient must be able to enter the partitioned area so that the partitions are on each side of the patient. Consultation areas without partitions may be approved if the board deems the consultation area will provide a reasonable assurance of privacy. Consultation areas must not contain any item for sale apart from the articles needed for counseling sessions. Pharmacists must have access to patient profiles in order to comply with part 6800.0910. Consultation areas must be accessible to the patient from the outside of the prescription dispensing area and be open at all times when the pharmacy is open; and</p>

                  <p>When dispensing a filled prescription for a patient, a pharmacist must consult with the patient or the patient's agent or caregiver and inquire about the patient's understanding of the use of the drug according to this part.</p>
                  <p>A. Upon receipt of a new prescription, following a review of the patient's record, a pharmacist shall personally initiate discussion of matters which in the professional judgment of the pharmacist will enhance or optimize drug therapy with each patient or the agent or caregiver of the patient. The discussion shall be in person, whenever applicable, may be supplemented with written material, and shall include appropriate elements of patient counseling. These elements include the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) the name and description of the drug;</p>
                  <p>(2) the dosage form, dose, route of administration, and duration of drug therapy;</p>
                  <p>(3) intended use of the drug and expected action;</p>
                  <p>(4) special directions and precautions for preparation, administration, and use by the patient;</p>
                  <p>(5) common severe side effects, adverse effects, or interactions and therapeutic contraindications that may be encountered, including their avoidance, and the action required if they occur;</p>
                  <p>(6) techniques for self-monitoring of drug therapy;</p>
                  <p>(7) proper storage;</p>
                  <p>(8) prescription refill information;</p>
                  <p>(9) action to be taken in the event of a missed dose; and</p>
                  <p>(10) pharmacist comments relevant to the patient's drug therapy, including any other information peculiar to the specific patient or drug.</p>
                  <p>B. The pharmacist must counsel the patient on a refilled prescription if deemed necessary according to the pharmacist's professional judgment. The consultation must be in person whenever applicable.</p>
                  <p>A pharmacist may vary or omit the patient information if, in the pharmacist's professional judgment, the variation or omission serves the best interest of the patient because of the particular individual circumstances involved. If there is any material variation from the minimal information required by this subpart in the information provided or, if consultation is not provided, that fact and the circumstances involved shall be noted on the prescription, in the patient's records, or in a specially developed log.</p>
                  <p>Personal communication by the pharmacist is not required for inpatients of a hospital or other institution, such as a licensed nursing home, where other licensed health care professionals are authorized to administer the drugs, or where a patient or patient's agent or caregiver has expressed a desire not to receive the consultation. When a new filled prescription or a refilled prescription for which counseling is required is being mailed or delivered to the patient by common carrier or delivery services, the consultation must still be provided but may be accomplished by providing written information to the patient regarding the medication being dispensed and the availability of the pharmacist to answer questions, and through the provision of a toll-free phone number for long distance calls.</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this part shall prohibit pharmacists from charging for these services.</p>

                  <p>B. "Approved provider" means any association, corporation, educational institution, organization, group, or person who has been recognized by the Board of Pharmacy, in accordance with subpart 3, as having met its criteria indicative of the ability to provide quality continuing education programs or who has been recognized by the board as being approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) for the provision of quality continuing education programs.</p>
                  <p>C. "Continuing pharmacy education" is a planned learning experience beyond a formal undergraduate degree program designed to promote the continual development of professional knowledge, professional skills, and professional attitudes on the part of the pharmacist and shall include but is not limited to professional postgraduate education in any of the following subjects:</p>

                  <p>Beginning March 4, 1975, no annual license renewal shall be issued to a pharmacist under Minnesota Statutes, section 151.13, until the pharmacist has submitted to the board satisfactory evidence that the pharmacist has completed at least 30 hours of approved continuing education during the previous two-year period. Thereafter, a pharmacist shall submit the evidence every two years. Pharmacists exempted from the payment of all renewal fees and from the filing of any application for renewal under Minnesota Statutes, section 326.56, subdivision 2, shall also be exempted from the requirements of this subpart for a concurrent period of time. Beginning with the 1981-1983 reporting period, participation in continuing education shall be reported by September 30 of each even-numbered year. The board may grant a pharmacist, on application, an extension of time not to exceed one year to comply with the requirements of this subpart. The extension shall not relieve the pharmacist from complying with the continuing education requirements for any other two-year period. Each pharmacist is responsible for maintaining a complete record of the pharmacist's continuing education participation during each continuing education reporting cycle.</p>

A pharmacy technician's registration renewal for calendar year 2014 shall not be issued unless the technician has completed 20 hours of approved continuing pharmacy technician education during the two-year period between August 1, 2011, and July 31, 2013. Thereafter, no annual pharmacy technician registration renewal shall be issued unless the technician presents the board with satisfactory evidence of completion of 20 hours of approved continuing pharmacy technician education per two-year reporting period. Each reporting period shall end on July 31 of odd-numbered years.</p>
                  <p>B. Continuing education must focus on the competencies that the technician must carry out and the specific duties that the technician performs. Technicians exempted from the payment of all renewal fees and from the filing of any application for renewal under Minnesota Statutes, section 326.56, subdivision 2, shall also be exempted from the requirements of this subpart for a concurrent period of time.

                  <p>Application may be made by an association, corporation, educational institution, organization, or person to be designated as an approved provider on forms provided by the board. The applicant shall provide, at a minimum, information regarding administrative and record keeping procedures used for past programs; a history of the content, methods of delivery, and faculty qualifications for past programs; methods of program needs assessment and development that the applicant has used; and evaluation mechanisms that the applicant has used. The applicant shall agree to maintain records of program content, evaluation summary, and attendance for at least three years following completion of each program. The application must cover the two-year reporting period for which provider approval is sought.</p>
                  <p>The board shall approve an applicant as a continuing education provider based on the applicant's compliance with the following criteria:</p>
                  <p>A. The continuing education programs must have had an identifiable administrative authority who was responsible for meeting all quality criteria and for maintaining records of program content, planning, delivery, evaluation, and attendance.</p>
                  <p>B. The programs' administrative requirements must have included:</p>
                  <p>(1) promotion and advertising of continuing education activities in a responsible fashion clearly indicating in promotional material the educational objectives of the particular activity, the nature of the audience that may best benefit from the activity, the schedule of the activity, the cost of the activity to the participant and the items covered by that cost, the amount of continuing education credit that can be earned through participation in the activity, and the credentials of the faculty;</p>
                  <p>(2) maintenance and availability of records of participation in continuing education activities adequate to serve the needs of the participants and others requiring this information; and</p>
                  <p>(3) provision of evidence to the participant, in the form of a certificate or other document, of satisfactory completion of a continuing education activity as reasonably required by the participant.</p>
                  <p>C. The educational content development must have included:</p>
                  <p>(1) Advance planning that includes a statement of educational goals, behavioral objectives, or both, that are measurable.</p>
                  <p>(2) Activities designed to satisfy educational needs which the board has determined to be appropriate.</p>
                  <p>(3) Involvement of members of the intended audience in identifying their own continuing education needs.</p>
                  <p>(4) Activities designed to explore one subject or a group of closely related subjects. If an activity involves multiple components, such as a lecture series, all segments must be devoted to integrally related subjects.</p>
                  <p>(5) Appropriate mediated material and supportive instructional material. Previously offered activities, including those in mediated forms, must have been reviewed by the provider prior to being offered to new audiences, with a view toward maintaining technical quality, timeliness, and currency of content, and faculty must have had the opportunity to update material, if they desired, before an activity was offered to a new audience.</p>
                  <p>D. The methods of delivery must have been consistent with the special needs of the program.</p>
                  <p>E. The teaching staff for a particular continuing education activity must have been competent in the subject matter and qualified by experience or preparation to the tasks and method of delivery.</p>
                  <p>F. An evaluation mechanism must have been provided to allow the participants to assess their achievement of program objectives.</p>
                  <p>G. The provider must have developed and employed evaluation techniques that assess the effectiveness of the continuing education activities, and the level of fulfillment of the stated objectives, for the purpose of provider and activity improvement if indicated.</p>
                  <p>Applicants with no history of program development in compliance with items A to G or with an incomplete history will be judged on their willingness and ability to comply with these criteria in the future.</p>

                  <p>B. A pharmacist, pharmacist-intern, or pharmacy technician shall be allowed adequate time from work within each four consecutive hours of work to utilize the nearest convenient restroom.</p>
                  <p>C. A pharmacy may, but is not required to, close when a pharmacist is on a break. If the pharmacy does not close, the pharmacist shall either remain within the licensed pharmacy or within the establishment in which the licensed pharmacy is located in order to be available for emergencies. In addition, the following apply:</p>
                  <p>(1) pharmacy technicians, pharmacist-interns, and other supportive staff, authorized by the pharmacist on duty, may continue to perform duties as allowed under this chapter;</p>
                  <p>(2) no duties reserved to pharmacists and pharmacist-interns under any part of this chapter, or that require the professional judgment of a pharmacist, may be performed by pharmacy technicians or other supportive staff; and</p>
                  <p>(3) only prescriptions that have been certified by a pharmacist, as required by part 6800.3100, may be dispensed while the pharmacist is on break; except that prescriptions that require counseling by a pharmacist, including all new prescriptions and those refill prescriptions for which a pharmacist has determined that counseling is necessary, may be dispensed only if the following conditions are met:</p>
                  <p>(a) the pharmacy develops a list of drugs that may not be dispensed while a pharmacist is taking an allowed break, without the patient receiving counseling from a pharmacist, when counseling would normally be required;</p>
                  <p>(b) the patient, or other individual who is picking up the prescription on behalf of the patient, is told that the pharmacist is on a break and is offered the chance to wait until the pharmacist returns from break in order to receive counseling;</p>
                  <p>(c) if the patient or caregiver declines to wait, a telephone number at which the patient or a caregiver can be reached is obtained;</p>
                  <p>(d) after returning from the break, the pharmacist makes a reasonable effort to contact the patient or a caregiver by telephone and provides counseling; and</p>
                  <p>(e) the pharmacist documents the counseling that was provided or documents why counseling was not provided, including a description of the efforts made to contact the patient or caregiver. The documentation shall be retained by the pharmacy, and be made available for inspection by the board or its authorized representatives, for a period of at least two years.</p>
                  <p>D. In pharmacies staffed by two or more pharmacists, the pharmacists shall stagger breaks so that at least one pharmacist remains on duty at all times that the pharmacy remains open for the transaction of business.</p>

                  <p>A. The filling of cells or cassettes is subject to the requirements of part 6800.3200, subpart 1, items A, B, E, F, G, and H, except that item F only applies if the pharmacy's policies and procedures require a pharmacist to verify the accuracy of the filling of the cell or cassette. Only one cell or cassette may be filled at a time.</p>
                  <p>B. The labeling of cells and cassettes is subject to the requirements of part 6800.3200, subpart 2, items A, B, C, and F. The requirements of part 6800.3200, subpart 2, items D and E, also apply unless the information required under those items is maintained in the packaging control record.</p>
                  <p>C. The pharmacy shall have a method to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the automated counting device and document the calibration and verification on a regular basis, consistent with the recommendations of the manufacturer of the device.</p>
                  <p>D. The pharmacy shall have procedures in place to prevent cross-contamination of cells and cassettes.</p>
                  <p>E. If the manufacturer's stock container is not available as required in part 6800.3100, subpart 3, a method for verifying that the correct drug is being dispensed must be specified in the policies and procedures. All other certification requirements in part 6800.3100, subpart 3, shall apply.</p>
                  <p>F. The pharmacy must have continuous quality assurance policies and procedures developed specifically for the automated counting device.</p>

                  <p>In addition to the requirements in subpart 1, the following requirements apply to automated drug distribution systems.</p>
                  <p>A. A pharmacist employed by the pharmacy, which is responsible for the control of the system, must review, interpret, and approve all prescription drug orders before any drug is distributed from the system to be administered to a patient. Access to drugs when a pharmacist has not reviewed and approved the prescription drug order is permitted only when a formal and written decision to allow such access is issued by the pharmacy and therapeutics committee or its equivalent. The committee must specify the patient care circumstances in which such access is allowed, the drugs that can be accessed, and the staff that are allowed to access the drugs.</p>
                  <p>B. Access to any automated medication distribution system must be limited to pharmacy and nonpharmacy personnel authorized to procure drugs from the system. Each person authorized to access the system must be assigned an individual, specific access code. Alternatively, access to the system may be controlled through the use of biometric identification procedures. A policy specifying time access parameters, such as time-outs, log-offs, and lock-outs must be in place.</p>
                  <p>C. At a minimum, the system must maintain records of:</p>
                  <p>(1) the identity of all personnel who access the automated unit, including any personnel who are required to witness a transaction;</p>
                  <p>(2) the reason for access;</p>
                  <p>(3) the date and time of access;</p>
                  <p>(4) the name, strength, dosage form, and quantity of the drug removed, returned, or wasted;</p>
                  <p>(5) the name of the patient for whom the drug was ordered; and</p>
                  <p>(6) any additional information the pharmacist in charge may deem necessary.</p>
                  <p>These records shall be reviewed for discrepancies on a periodic basis. The pharmacist-in-charge is responsible for the quality, accuracy, and timeliness of the review and must ensure that appropriate actions are taken to deal with any discrepancies found.</p>
                  <p>D. The pharmacy and therapeutics or relevant committee shall develop and regularly review a list of drugs or categories of drugs that are prohibited from being distributed through an automated distribution system. The review must take place at least annually. A high-alert drug may be distributed through an automated distribution system only if the pharmacy and therapeutics or relevant committee has determined that the drug need not be included on the list of drugs prohibited from being distributed through an automated distribution system. Patient-specific drug additions or deletions to the automated distribution device or system shall be determined by a pharmacist.</p>
                  <p>E. The use of an open matrix drawer that allows access to more than one drug at a time must be limited to noncontrolled substance drugs, unless the entire drawer contains only one controlled substance drug product. Noncontrolled substance drugs may be stored in the open matrix drawer if they are:</p>
                  <p>(1) large bulky items such as intravenous infusion bags;</p>
                  <p>(2) nonlegend drugs that are safely arranged;</p>
                  <p>(3) legend drugs that are not look-alike products; or</p>
                  <p>(4) drugs properly packaged and labeled for an individual patient.</p>
                  <p>F. Removal of a high-alert drug from the system must be checked by a second licensed health care professional to ensure that the prescription drug order is being correctly interpreted and that the correct drug has been removed. This requirement does not apply when:</p>
                  <p>(1) a pharmacist has reviewed and approved the prescription drug order prior to the removal of the high-alert drug from the system;</p>
                  <p>(2) a licensed practitioner controls the ordering, preparation, and administration of the medication during a medical procedure; or</p>
                  <p>(3) the prescribing practitioner has determined that the high-alert drug must be administered before the drug order can be reviewed by a pharmacist or a second licensed health care professional.</p>
                  <p>G. A pharmacist must certify all packaging, labeling, and stocking associated with the use of an automated drug distribution system. Unless the certification process utilizes a fail-safe bar coding, certification must be performed by a pharmacist. Certification must be documented and records must be retained for at least two years.</p>
                  <p>H. Automated distribution devices must be secured or kept in a locked medication room when not in actual use.</p>
                  <p>I. Unused drugs must be returned to the pharmacy or to the system's secure, designated return bin or equivalent area. Restocking of the system may only be performed by designated pharmacy personnel with required certification.</p>
                  <p>J. Assessments of automated distribution devices must be performed to ensure, at a minimum, that:</p>
                  <p>(1) drugs are properly stored in their assigned locations and in pharmacy-approved configurations;</p>
                  <p>(2) outdated drugs are removed and replaced;</p>
                  <p>(3) only approved drugs are in the device;</p>
                  <p>(4) inventory levels are appropriate based on usage; and</p>
                  <p>(5) the device and drugs are secure.</p>
                  <p>Each of the five requirements in item J must be assessed at least on a monthly basis, but all need not be assessed at the same time.</p>
                  <p>K. Pharmacy personnel must conduct, at least monthly, an audit of controlled substances to ensure accuracy of distribution and proper record keeping.</p>
                  <p>L. The system must provide for maintenance of patient confidentiality, so that unauthorized individuals do not have access to patient data.</p>
                  <p>M. Policies and procedures must be in place for return of unused drugs and for drug wastage and the documentation of drug wastage.</p>
                  <p>N. Continuous quality assurance must be developed specifically for the automated drug distribution system or device. An ongoing failure mode effect analysis or quality assurance process must be in place and address possible system failures, process failures, high-alert drugs, medication errors, and controlled substance discrepancies.</p>

                  <p>A. Restrictions on pickup or delivery of prescription drug orders or filled prescriptions.</p>
                  <p>No licensed pharmacist shall participate in any arrangement or agreement whereby prescription drug orders or filled prescriptions may be left at, picked up from, accepted by, or delivered to any place of business not licensed as a pharmacy. Provided, however, that nothing in this part prohibits a licensed pharmacist or a licensed pharmacy, by means of its employee or by use of a common carrier, from picking up prescription drug orders or delivering filled prescriptions at the office or home of the prescriber, at the residence of the patient, or at the hospital or long-term care facility in which a patient is confined. A pharmacy may deliver filled prescriptions at the place of employment of the patient or a designated caregiver of the patient only if the pharmacy:</p>
                  <p>(1) obtains and documents the authorization of the patient or patient's caregiver for delivery at the place of employment;</p>
                  <p>(2) ensures the filled prescription order is delivered directly to the patient or the patient's caregiver as authorized; and</p>
                  <p>(3) ensures the security of protected health information.</p>
                  <p>B. Direct prescription delivery.</p>
                  <p>A pharmacy that employs the United States Postal Service or other common carrier to deliver a filled prescription directly to a patient must, based on the professional judgment of the pharmacist:</p>
                  <p>(1) use adequate storage or shipping containers and shipping processes to ensure drug stability and potency. The shipping processes must include the use of appropriate packaging material and devices, according to the recommendations of the manufacturer or the United States Pharmacopeia Chapter 1079, in order to ensure that the drug is kept at appropriate storage temperatures throughout the delivery process to maintain the integrity of the medication;</p>
                  <p>(2) use shipping containers that are sealed in a manner to detect evidence of opening or tampering;</p>
                  <p>(3) develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure accountability, safe delivery, and compliance with temperature requirements. The policies and procedures must address when drugs do not arrive at their destination in a timely manner or when there is evidence that the integrity of a drug has been compromised during shipment. In these instances, the pharmacy must make provisions for the replacement of the drugs; and</p>
                  <p>(4) provide for an electronic, telephonic, or written communication mechanism for a pharmacist, or a pharmacy intern working under the direct supervision of a pharmacist, to offer counseling to the patient. The patient must receive information indicating what the patient should do if the integrity of the packaging or medication has been compromised during shipment.</p>
                  <p>C. Adulteration.</p>
                  <p>A drug is adulterated if it has been exposed to conditions of fire, water, or extreme temperature, which may have rendered it injurious to health.</p>

                  <p>Prescription drug orders may be transmitted to a pharmacy via the use of a fax machine only in accordance with this subpart and as permitted by law. For a pharmacy other than a hospital pharmacy that is transmitting solely within the institution, the procedures must provide for the identification of the person sending the prescription drug order. Unless the fax transmission is received on a machine generating a copy that is readily readable for at least five years, all fax transmissions of prescription drug orders shall be followed up within 72 hours with the original hard copy of the order or the pharmacist shall reduce the order received by fax to writing that is of permanent quality. Prescription drug orders for Schedule II-IV controlled substances received by fax shall be handled according to the rules of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Prescriptions faxed to the pharmacy by the patient are not to be filled or dispensed.</p>

Electronic prescriptions for controlled substance drugs must conform to the rules of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Except for prescription drug orders for drugs to be administered in an acute care hospital, an electronically transmitted prescription shall be transmitted only to the pharmacy of the patient's choice.</p>

Prescriptions transmitted to a pharmacy's answering machine or an electronic voice recording device shall only be retrieved by a licensed pharmacist or registered pharmacist-intern working under the immediate and direct supervision of a pharmacist. A technician may not retrieve a prescription from these devices, except in the case where the practitioner or authorized agent of the practitioner is approving additional refills of a prescription previously dispensed from the pharmacy and no other changes are made to the prescription. Personnel used for clerical duties according to part 6800.3850, subpart 7, may not retrieve any prescription information from these devices. Prescriptions retrieved from these devices are considered verbal prescription drug orders that must be reduced to writing and are subject to the requirements of part 6800.3100, subpart 1.</p>

Applications for the registration of a pharmacist-intern shall be on a form or forms the Board of Pharmacy prescribes and shall be accompanied by a fee established in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 151. Registration remains in effect if notices of employment, progress report affidavits, or similar forms are submitted as required by the board, and if the board is satisfied that the registrant is in good faith and with reasonable diligence pursuing a degree in pharmacy, is a qualified applicant awaiting an examination for licensure, or is completing a pharmacy residency or fellowship. Registration as an intern for purposes of participating in a residency or fellowship program remains in effect until the individual obtains licensure as a pharmacist, for two years, or until the completion of the residency or fellowship program, whichever occurs first. Credit for internship hours will not be granted unless registration forms and materials, notices of employment, and progress report affidavits are submitted as required by the board.</p>

                  <p>(5) the method by which a pharmacy would be furnished with a copy of each prescriber's prescription drug order or approved protocol reference which will be used as a hard copy prescription drug order and will trigger drug replacement; and</p>
                  <p>(6) a system whereby the supplying pharmacy inspects the contents of the emergency box at least every 60 days for expiration dates of the medications, the tamperproof seal, and the correctness of the contents list; and documents and retains records of the inspection.</p>
                  <p>C. The pharmacy having ownership and responsibility shall ensure that each portable emergency supply is:</p>
