                <p>The following provisions govern all advertising relating to the practice of cosmetology:</p>
                <p>A. It is a violation of this chapter to advertise or offer any board-regulated services from an unlicensed salon or an unlicensed practitioner.</p>
                <p>B. Any salon advertisement must list the licensed name of the salon as shown on the salon license. Franchise and corporations using a common brand name in advertisements related to multiple locations may use the common brand name instead of the full assumed name listed on the salon license. Salons that reference staff names in any advertisement must list at least the first name of the licensee as shown on the individual's license.</p>
                <p>C. An individual practitioner advertising the practitioner's licensed services must list either the full name as shown on the individual's license or the name of the salon as shown on the salon license.</p>
                <p>D. A practitioner leasing space in a licensed salon may advertise under a business name if the full name of the practitioner as shown on the practitioner's license is listed. If the practitioner's full name is not listed, wherever the business name appears, it must be immediately followed by "at (insert legible name of salon as it appears on the salon license)."</p>
                <p>E. Only currently licensed practitioners may identify themselves as a "cosmetologist," "esthetician," "aesthetician," "advanced practice esthetician," "advanced practice aesthetician," "nail technician," and "eyelash or lash technician." It is a violation of this chapter to qualify any board license title with another term, including the use of terms such as "medical," "certified," "master," and other qualifying terms.</p>

                  <p>B. In addition to any board-approved instructor CE course, an instructor may use qualifying credits from completed classes on teaching methods or clinical practice from the MnSCU system schools, the University of Minnesota, or other postsecondary schools licensed by the Office of Higher Education but not licensed by the board. Preapproval of such courses is not required. The instructor must retain an official transcript and the class syllabus or catalog course description, which must establish the class hours and establish that the content of the course is based on teaching methodology or clinical practice. Postsecondary courses are equivalent to 16 CE hours per credit and lab courses are equivalent to 32 CE hours per credit. CEUs earned are accepted as one CE hour per CEU credit.</p>
                  <p>C. Instructors teaching approved instructor CE courses may apply CE hours from the courses to the instructor's license renewal if the CE hours are claimed only once per course, and are not used again on future renewals.</p>
                  <p>D. Instructors teaching approved core and professional practice CEs may apply the CE hours from the courses on the instructor's operator or salon manager license renewal if the CE hours are claimed only once per course, and are not used again on future renewals.</p>
                  <p>E. The instructor may apply a maximum of 15 CE hours from instructor CE classes taught by the instructor each renewal period.</p>
                  <p>F. Instructor CEs are valid for only one license renewal.</p>
                  <p>G. To renew an instructor's license, the instructor must hold an active operator or salon manager license in the area in which the instructor holds an instructor's license.</p>
                  <p>H. When a course has been approved by the board as both a professional practice CE course and as an instructor clinical practice CE course, licensees may apply the CEs earned from the course to the renewal of both the instructor license and the practitioner license.</p>

                  <p>C. If the renewal is audited by the board, the licensee must provide proof of requested items within 30 days of the board's request. When a licensee fails to respond or does not provide proof as requested in an audit, and the board cannot verify the licensee's CEs through the provider identified by the licensee, the board must rescind the renewal that was based on the unverified credits. The licensee is subject to discipline as identified in item A, and the licensee may not practice until a new license is issued.

                  <p>A. A salon as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 155A.23, subdivision 9, that is located in a nursing home, housing with services entity, or assisted living facility is required to be licensed if any cosmetology services are provided to anyone other than the homebound residents of the nursing home, housing with services entity, or assisted living facility. A resident of a housing with services entity receiving comprehensive home care services and residents of an assisted living facility receiving assisted living services are considered to be homebound residents. All residents of a nursing home are considered homebound for the purposes of this part.</p>

Applicants must carry professional liability coverage of at least $25,000 for each claim and $50,000 total coverage for each policy year, and must pay the fees required by Minnesota Statutes, section 155A.33.</p>
                  <p>B. The permit holder may only provide the following services:</p>
                  <p>(1) cosmetologists may style, reinforce, or extend hair;</p>
                  <p>(2) cosmetologists and nail technicians may remove and apply nail polish; and</p>
                  <p>(3) cosmetologists, estheticians, and advanced practice estheticians may remove and apply makeup, except eyelash extensions may not be applied or removed.</p>
                  <p>C. Permits have the restrictions in subitems (1) to (6).</p>
                  <p>(1) Permits expire on December 31 of the year in which the permit is issued, but are valid only with an active manager's license held by the permit holder.</p>
                  <p>(2) One permit covers all events registered by the permit holder with the board for the calendar year.</p>
                  <p>(3) Each event must be registered online with the board at least 48 hours prior to the start of the event.</p>
                  <p>(4) The permit holder must print the special events permit from the online license record and have the printed permit in the permit holder's possession during each event.</p>
                  <p>(5) The permit holder must comply with all infection control requirements and safety requirements in parts 2105.0375 and 2105.0377, and must carry a first aid kit that meets the requirements of part 2105.0370, item A.</p>
                  <p>(6) At each special event, the permit holder must provide a sufficient number of brushes, combs, makeup brushes, and other implements equal to the number of persons receiving cosmetology services at the event, so that only disinfected tools and implements are used on each client.</p>
                  <p>D. The hours spent working under a special event permit do not count toward the work hours in a licensed salon required to obtain other licenses under this chapter.</p>
                  <p>E. A special event permit holder must not use the permit to provide regulated services in a mobile vehicle or mobile structure that is owned or operated by the permit holder or a board licensee unless the mobile vehicle or mobile structure is licensed as a mobile salon under this part. A licensed mobile salon does not require a special event permit for services offered in the mobile salon.</p>

                <p>A. There must be at least two licensed instructors on the school premises whenever students are present; and the school must maintain a minimum ratio of one instructor for each 1 to 20 students present each day. All students must be under the supervision of an instructor at all times when in a classroom or clinic and whenever the student is performing cosmetology services on the school's premises.</p>
                <p>(1) A school may use unlicensed instructors who hold a salon manager license as substitutes for licensed instructors for no more than 30 full or partial calendar days in 12 consecutive months. Whenever an unlicensed substitute instructor is present, at least one licensed instructor must be on the school premises. When these conditions are met, the substitute instructor is considered an instructor for the instructor quota.</p>
                <p>(2) The DSM must notify the board each day that an unlicensed substitute instructor is present by e-mailing the board with "substitute instructor" in the subject line. The e-mail must contain the substitute's name, the name of the absent instructor, the dates the substitute will be working, and the name and license number of the supervising instructor, and the number of days in the past 12 months that a substitute has been used.</p>
                <p>(3) The DSM must e-mail the board by the end of the day each day the school fails to meet the required instructor quota, with "instructor quota failure" and the school name in the subject line. The e-mail must contain the names and license numbers of the absent instructors, and the names and license numbers of the instructors present.</p>
                <p>B. If a school is not in compliance with item A, the board must notify the school that it will not accept hours accrued by students during the period of noncompliance. The school must notify the students in writing of the board's decision and provide the board a copy of the required notification to each student that the hours accumulated during the period of noncompliance will not be accepted by the board.</p>
                <p>C. Instructors must devote the entire instructional time scheduled to training and must not have any additional noninstructional duties or responsibilities during class or clinical time.</p>
                <p>D. Schools must maintain instructor payroll and time records showing hours worked each day for each pay period for three consecutive calendar years.</p>
                <p>E. Instructors are restricted to instruction in the area of their practitioner license and may not instruct in other disciplines.</p>
                <p>F. All instructors must wear identification badges at all times stating their name and "Instructor." These badges must be at least two inches by one inch.</p>
