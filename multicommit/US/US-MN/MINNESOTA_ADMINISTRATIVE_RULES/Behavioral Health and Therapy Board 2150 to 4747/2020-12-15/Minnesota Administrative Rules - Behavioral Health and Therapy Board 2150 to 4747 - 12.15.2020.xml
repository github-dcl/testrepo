                <p>The board shall mail an application for license renewal to a licensee at least 45 days before the expiration date of the license. In the alternative, upon the licensee's election, the board shall send the application via e-mail. Placing the application for license renewal in first class United States mail, addressed to the licensee at the licensee's last known mailing address with postage prepaid, constitutes valid mailing. Sending the application via e-mail to the licensee's last known e-mail address on file also constitutes valid notification.

                  <p>The licensee shall submit the variance request on a form designated by the board, and include the variance fee in Minnesota Statutes, section 14.056, and the late fee for licensure renewal. The variance request is subject to Minnesota Statutes, section 14.055, subdivision 4, and must include a written plan listing the activities, including the dates and the number of hours for each, offered to meet the requirement. Hours completed after the renewal date pursuant to the written plan count toward meeting only the requirements of the previous renewal period. A variance granted under this subpart expires six months after the renewal date. A licensee who is granted a variance but fails to complete the required continuing education within the six-month period may apply for a second variance in accordance with this subpart.</p>

                  <p>A. Licensed professional counselors must obtain supervision by an approved supervisor for the first 2,000 hours of professional practice. This part does not prohibit licensees from participating in other supervisory relationships for purposes other than meeting the requirements of this part.</p>
                  <p>B. The content of supervision must include:</p>
                  <p>(1) professional counseling knowledge, skills, values, and ethics with specific application to the practice issues faced by the supervisee;</p>
                  <p>(2) the standards of practice and ethical conduct, with particular emphasis given to the professional counselor's role and appropriate responsibilities, professional boundaries, and power dynamics; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the supervisee's permissible scope of practice, as defined by Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.50, subdivision 5.</p>
                  <p>C. The supervision must be obtained at the rate of two hours of supervision per 40 hours of professional practice, for a total of 100 hours of supervision. The supervision must be evenly distributed over the course of the supervised professional practice. At least 75 percent of the required supervision hours must be received in person. The remaining 25 percent of the required hours may be received by telephone or by audio or audiovisual electronic device. At least 50 percent of the required hours of supervision must be received on an individual basis. The remaining 50 percent may be received in a group setting.</p>
                  <p>D. The supervision must be completed in no fewer than 12 consecutive months and no more than 36 consecutive months.</p>
                  <p>E. Except as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.53, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), the supervised practice must be completed under an approved supervision plan. Applicants must submit, on a form specified by the board, a written plan for meeting the supervision requirements. If the board determines that the supervision plan submitted meets the applicable supervision requirements, then the supervisee's completion of the supervised practice, as verified under this part, applies toward the supervised professional counseling practice requirement provided that there was no substantial change from the approved supervision plan. A licensee must not engage in the practice of professional counseling until the licensee's supervision plan has been approved by the board.</p>
                  <p>F. A professional counselor licensed under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.53, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), and who maintain licensure as a licensed psychological practitioner may satisfy the 2,000 hours of supervised professional practice by complying with the supervision requirements for a licensed psychological practitioner in Minnesota Statutes, section 148.925. Upon completion of 2,000 hours of supervised professional practice, the supervisor shall submit the verification described in item I. If a professional counselor is no longer licensed as a psychological practitioner for any reason prior to completion of the 2,000 hours of supervised professional practice, then the professional counselor shall comply with this item until completion of the 2,000 hours of supervised professional practice.</p>
                  <p>G. Applicants who are licensed psychologists under Minnesota Statutes, section 148.907, at the time of application for licensure as professional counselors are considered to have met the 2,000 hours of supervised professional practice. Such applicants shall submit true and correct copies of notarized supervision verifications submitted to the Board of Psychology pursuant to part 7200.0600.</p>
                  <p>H. The board shall not accept the verification of supervised practice, or approve a supervision plan, if the board determines that the supervisor does not meet the requirements of subpart 3.</p>
                  <p>I. Upon completion of the 2,000 hours of supervised professional practice, the supervisor shall verify, on a form specified by the board, that the supervisee has completed the supervision plan. The supervised practice required under this part is unacceptable if the supervisor attests that the supervisee's performance, competence, or adherence to the standards of practice and ethical conduct has been unsatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>J. A licensee shall submit a new supervision plan for board approval within 30 days if any of the following occur:</p>
                  <p>(1) the licensee has a new supervisor;</p>
                  <p>(2) the scope or content of the counseling practice changes substantially during the course of the supervision; or</p>
                  <p>(3) the licensee begins a new counseling position.</p>
                  <p>K. Failure to submit changes to the supervision plan as required by item J shall result in hours accrued during this time period not counting towards the supervised practice requirement.</p>
                  <p>L. An applicant may receive complete or partial credit for supervised professional practice experience occurring postdegree but prior to licensure if the supervised professional practice meets the requirements of this subpart. Verification shall be on a form specified by the board, and shall be submitted in lieu of the supervision plan required in item E.</p>

However, services may be provided if the provider is resolving the impairment in the manner required in subpart 2.</p>
                  <p>F. The provider shall not provide counseling services to a client when there is a fundamental divergence or conflict of service goals, interests, values, or attitudes between the client and the provider that adversely affects the professional relationship.

                  <p>A. A licensee meets the standards in part 4747.1100, subpart 2, when practicing alcohol and drug counseling with a client who is a member of an ethnic minority group, an identified population group, or a client with a disability by acting according to this subpart. If a licensee is inexperienced as compared to other licensees or the professional community's standard of care in practicing alcohol and drug counseling with ethnic minority, identified population, or disabled clients, the licensee:</p>
                  <p>(1) engages in ongoing consultation with a licensee who meets the professional community's standard of care with respect to such clients;</p>
                  <p>(2) practices under the supervision of a licensee who meets the professional community's standard of care with respect to such clients; or</p>
                  <p>(3) refers the client to a licensee who meets the professional community's standard of care with respect to such clients.</p>
                  <p>B. An alcohol and drug counselor fluently speaks the primary or preferred language of the client, works with a certified or qualified interpreter according to Minnesota Statutes, section 546.44, and uses the services of a certified or qualified interpreter or refers the client to a licensee who either is fluent in the client's primary or preferred language or works with qualified interpreters.</p>
                  <p>C. Licensees who practice alcohol and drug counseling with deaf, deaf-blind, hard-of-hearing, or late-deafened clients:</p>
                  <p>(1) are proficient in American Sign Language at the advanced-plus level or higher of the Sign Communication Proficiency Interview (SCPI) ratings, if the client's primary or preferred language is American Sign Language; or</p>
                  <p>(2) are trained in working with and work with an American Sign Language interpreter who qualifies as both a certified interpreter and a certified transliterator by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf or certified at level four or higher by the National Association of the Deaf; or</p>
                  <p>(3) refer the client to a licensee who is either proficient in American Sign Language at the advanced-plus or higher level or who is trained to work with a certified American Sign Language interpreter or transliterator. Licensees who practice with such clients must submit a statement signed by a supervisor that the licensee has demonstrated a minimum proficiency in practicing with such clients.</p>
                  <p>D. Licensees inexperienced compared to the professional community's standard of care in practicing alcohol and drug counseling with members of identified population groups:</p>
                  <p>(1) engage in ongoing consultation with a licensee who meets the professional community's standard of care with respect to such clients;</p>
                  <p>(2) practice under the supervision of a licensee who meets the professional community's standard of care with respect to such clients; or</p>
