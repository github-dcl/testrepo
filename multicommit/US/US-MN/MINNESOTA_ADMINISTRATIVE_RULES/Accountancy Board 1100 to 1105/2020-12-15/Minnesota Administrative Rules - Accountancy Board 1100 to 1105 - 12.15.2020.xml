                <p>A. Applications for initial certificates and for renewal of certificates pursuant to the act must be made on a form provided by the board and, in the case of applications for renewal, must be filed no later than the expiration date set by the act or this chapter. Applications are not considered filed until the board receives the fully completed application, the applicable fee prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, and the following supporting documentation:</p>

                <p>(2) for renewal certificates, evidence of completion of continuing education requirements described in item B.</p>
                <p>Applicants who do not supply all required supporting documents and applicable fees for an initial certificate within three years of the date the application was received by the board shall submit a new application with the required fee. If an application for renewal is filed late, it must also be accompanied by the delinquency fee prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04. In addition, the reinstatement fee prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, must be paid if the renewal is filed more than two years late. The application for renewal must be submitted on a form provided by the board by December 31 of each year.</p>
                <p>B. Applications for renewal of certificates must be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to the board that the applicant has complied with the continuing professional education requirements under this chapter and Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, subdivision 4.</p>

                <p>(4) Licensees shall renew their certificates with a status of "active" if they:</p>
                <p>(a) are employees of a firm granted a permit under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05, or are engaged as independent contractors by a firm granted a permit under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05;</p>
                <p>(b) issue compilation reports other than through a CPA firm;</p>

                <p>(5) Licensees shall renew their certificates with a status of "active" if they used experience of the type specified in part 1105.2600, item C, in obtaining the initial certificate and are still directly or indirectly performing through the supervision of others, work which is similar, in the opinion of the board, to the work claimed as experience.</p>
                <p>(6) Nonresident individuals who do not meet the requirements of part 1105.7900, item B, and Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, subdivision 7, or 326A.14, and who have never been granted a CPA certificate by any state must not be issued a certificate by this state unless the individual previously met the nonresident requirements of part 1105.1600, subpart 1, and meets all other requirements for initial issuance of a certificate.</p>
                <p>D. Applicants, licensees, or nonresident individuals who desire to practice in this state but do not meet the requirements of part 1105.7900, item B, who have successfully passed the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination and have met the experience and education requirements of parts 1105.2600 and 1105.2900, and Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, must either:</p>
                <p>(1) make an application and receive an initial certificate; or</p>
                <p>(2) make an application and receive an "active" certificate;</p>
                <p>if the applicants, licensees, or nonresident individuals who do not meet the requirements of part 1105.7900, item B, are owners or are employed by or become employed by a firm which has been issued a permit under this chapter and Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05, or are employees in the Office of the Legislative Auditor or State Auditor, and the employment results in the providing of professional services to a client. Applications must be accompanied by the applicable fee prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, and must be filed with the board within 60 days of meeting the criteria specified in this item.</p>
                <p>E. The 60-day period in item D starts on the date the applicant or licensee has:</p>
                <p>(1) received notification from the board or examination administrator that all sections of the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination have been successfully passed;</p>

                <p>The requirements of continuing professional education in items A to G apply pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, subdivision 4.</p>
                <p>A. A licensee holding a certificate with an active status shall:</p>
                <p>(1) complete a minimum of 20 hours of continuing professional education (CPE) complying with this chapter each year;</p>
                <p>(2) in a rolling three-year period, complete a minimum of 120 hours of CPE complying with this chapter including at least eight hours in regulatory ethics or behavioral ethics;</p>
                <p>(3) complete the required CPE by June 30 each year; and</p>
                <p>(4) report the required CPE to the board on a form provided by the board by December 31 each year.</p>
                <p>B. A continuing professional education period is one year, from July 1 to June 30. No carryforward of CPE from one period to the next is allowed. A licensee may carryback CPE hours earned after June 30 to satisfy the requirements of a prior CPE period provided that the late processing fees specified in item E are paid. Carryback hours used to satisfy the requirements of a prior CPE period must not also be used to satisfy the requirements of the period in which they were completed.</p>
                <p>C. Certificates may not be renewed until CPE requirements of this part are met or an exception is granted.</p>
                <p>D. A licensee holding a certificate with an inactive status who elects or is required to have an active certificate shall complete at least 120 hours of CPE complying with this chapter during the three-year period preceding application for an active certificate. Such licensee shall identify and complete a program of learning designed to demonstrate the currency of the licensee's competencies directly related to the licensee's area of service.</p>
                <p>E. Failure to report CPE, failure to obtain CPE required by this part, reporting of an amount less than that required, or fraudulently reporting CPE is a basis for disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08. A licensee not in compliance with this part shall be assessed a late processing fee of $50 for the first month, or partial month, of noncompliance and $25 per month, or partial month, of noncompliance thereafter until the date the licensee is in compliance with this part and provides documentation of compliance in writing to the board.</p>
                <p>F. A licensee electing to change the status of the licensee's certificate from a status of "active" to a status of "inactive" must:</p>
                <p>(1) notify the board of the request in writing on a form provided by the board; and</p>
                <p>(2) provide the board with documentation showing completion of a minimum of 120 hours of CPE required under this chapter during the three-year period ended June 30 preceding the effective date of the status change, with a minimum of 20 hours each year.</p>
                <p>The change in status from "active" to "inactive" is effective on January 1 following completion of subitems (1) and (2).</p>
                <p>G. The following requirements apply to licensees granted an initial certificate with an active status.</p>
                <p>(1) Licensees receiving their initial certificate between January 1 and June 30:</p>
                <p>(a) are exempt from the CPE requirement for the CPE period ended June 30 in the same year as the date the initial certificate was granted;</p>
                <p>(b) must complete the 20-hour requirement in item A by June 30 of the year following the date the initial certificate was granted; and</p>
                <p>(c) must complete the 120-hour requirement in item A by the June 30 three years after the date in which the initial certificate was granted.</p>
                <p>(2) Licensees receiving their initial certificate between July 1 and December 31:</p>
                <p>(a) are exempt from the CPE requirement for the CPE period ended June 30 in the year following the date the initial certificate was granted;</p>
                <p>(b) must complete the 20-hour requirement in item A by June 30 two years after the date in which the initial certificate was granted; and</p>
                <p>(c) must complete the 120-hour requirement in item A by June 30 four years after the date in which the initial certificate was granted.</p>

                <p>A. A licensee who does not engage in the practice of public accounting in any manner or who does not hold out as a CPA in any manner is not required to renew the certificate. The election of exempt status by a person takes effect following notification to the board. The notification must be made on a form provided by the board and continues in effect until a future renewal application is received by the board and a certificate renewal is granted.</p>
                <p>B. Persons electing to change from exempt status to active status shall report continuing professional education as described in subitems (1) to (3).</p>
                <p>(1) Submit evidence of completion of 50 hours of continuing professional education per year of exemption, up to a maximum of 120 hours, to be taken within 12 months prior to the renewal application in subjects specifically approved in advance by the board and meeting the requirements in part 1105.3100. The 50-hour requirement must be prorated for periods less than a full year.</p>
                <p>(2) If, at the time of application for exempt status, the licensee had not yet reported qualifying continuing professional education of 120 hours with a minimum of 20 hours per year for each of the three years prior to the application for exempt status, the licensee shall be required to report continuing professional education for those years in addition to the hours required in subitem (1).</p>
                <p>(3) Hours reported in subitem (1) may be used to satisfy the requirement in part 1105.3000 to the extent the hours fall within the one- or three-year CPE period.</p>
                <p>C. For purposes of this part, the "practice of public accounting in any manner" means issuing a report as described in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.01, subdivision 15, whether or not a fee is received. In addition, for purposes of this subpart, "hold out" means any oral or written communication conveying that the person holds a CPA certificate, including, without limitation, the displaying of the CPA certificate in any location where business is conducted and the use of titles or legends on letterheads, business cards, resumes, office doors, or advertisements and listings, including published membership listings of professional organizations.</p>

                <p>A. Applications by firms for initial issuance and for renewal of permits under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05, must be made on a form provided by the board and, in the case of applications for renewal, must be filed no later than December 31. Applications are not considered filed until the applicable fee prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, and all required documents prescribed in this chapter are received. Applicants who do not supply all required supporting documents and applicable fees for initial issuance of a permit within three years of the date the application was received by the board shall submit a new application with the required fee. If an application for permit renewal is filed late, it must also be accompanied by the delinquency fee prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04. In addition, the reinstatement fee prescribed in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, shall be paid if the renewal is filed more than two years late.</p>
                <p>B. A sole proprietor shall apply for a firm permit, when a permit is needed, as required by part 1105.4200.</p>
                <p>C.

                <p>D. The board shall not:</p>
                <p>(1) issue an initial permit to a firm until all partners, members, managers, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.01, shareholders, directors, and officers who are required to hold a certificate and whose principal place of business is in this state individually hold nonexpired certificates with an active status issued under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, covering the term of the firm permit to be issued; or</p>
                <p>(2) renew the permit of a firm until a two-thirds majority of partners, members, managers, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.01, shareholders, directors, and officers who hold a certificate and whose principal place of business is in this state individually renew their certificates with an active status or hold nonexpired certificates with an active status issued under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04, covering the term of the firm permit to be renewed. If all of these individuals do not renew their certificates with an active status within 60 days of expiration, the board shall automatically revoke the permit of the firm.</p>
                <p>E. A firm's partners, members, shareholders, directors, or officers resident in this state who do not hold, and are not eligible to hold, a certificate shall annually, in connection with initial issuance or renewal of the firm permit, submit with the application a statement signed by the person that:</p>
                <p>(1) indicates that person's agreement to comply with rules adopted by the board and be subject to the board enforcement specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08;</p>
                <p>(2) indicates that the person actively participates in the firm or affiliated entities on a full-time basis; and</p>
                <p>(3) specifies all professional licenses held by the person that were issued by the state and any disciplinary actions that have been taken against the licenses in the last five years.</p>
                <p>F. Persons specified in item E shall annually register with the board before December 31 on a form provided by the board and pay the fee specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.04.</p>
                <p>G. The board shall not renew a permit of a firm that has not undergone a peer review within the previous three years and has not complied with the board's rules with respect to the reviews.</p>
                <p>H. An "affiliated entity," for the purpose of item E, subitem (2), and Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05, subdivision 3, paragraph (c), clause (2), is an entity that is directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlled by the firm. "Control" means the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the entity through ownership, by contract or otherwise, and includes entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common ownership with the firm. "Actively participates" and "full-time basis," for the purpose of item E, subitem (2), means regular, continuous, and substantial involvement by an individual in management and professional activities of the firm or affiliated entities for more than 1,800 hours per year.</p>

                <p>A. For purposes of part 1105.4200 and Minnesota Statutes, sections 326A.05, subdivision 1, and 326A.14, subdivision 1, a client is considered to have its headquarters in this state if the location specified by the client as the address to which a service is directed is located in this state. In addition, a client is considered to have its headquarters in this state if:</p>
                <p>(1) the client has its headquarters, home office, or principal place of business located within this state;</p>
                <p>(2) the client is a subsidiary or affiliate of another entity that does not have its headquarters in this state, but the client subsidiary or client affiliate does have its headquarters in this state and enters into an agreement with a CPA firm to provide attest services;</p>
                <p>(3) the CPA firm's engagement letter or agreement to provide attest services is with a client located within this state; or</p>
                <p>(4) the client is a subsidiary or affiliate of another entity that does not have its headquarters in this state, but the client subsidiary or client affiliate is located within this state and the CPA firm is engaged, either directly or indirectly, to provide attest services and issue a report on the financial statements of the entity located within this state.</p>
                <p>B. Upon a request from the board, a firm not holding a permit in this state shall provide to the board documentation obtained from its client supporting the determination that the address to which a service is directed is not located in this state and shall provide other requested documentation supporting such determination.</p>
                <p>C. For purposes of determining whether a firm permit is required for a firm that does not have an office in this state, the board can make a determination, based on the documentation provided by the firm in item B and other information regarding the location and ownership structure of the client obtained from other state agencies, that a client has its headquarters in this state.</p>

                <p>(1) a copy of the report issued by the reviewer, including any response from the firm that addresses deficiencies or significant deficiencies contained in the report;</p>
                <p>(2) the final letter of acceptance from the report acceptance body; and</p>

                <p>Failure to file the required material by the required date is cause for discipline against the firm's permit.</p>
                <p>In the case where the report acceptance body and the firm have entered into an agreement to correct deficiencies, failure by the firm to abide by that agreement is grounds for discipline against the firm's permit and the certificates of the managers in charge of the firm's offices maintained in this state.</p>
                <p>Except as specified in part 1105.4800, a written report, including any responses by the firm attached to the report, on all inspections conducted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board submitted within 30 days of receipt to the board shall meet the requirements of this part.</p>
                <p>Nothing in this part requires a firm to submit the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board inspections report to the board if a peer review encompassing the firm's public company attest client practice has been conducted and submitted to the board according to parts 1105.4600 to 1105.5500 or according to standards adopted by the AICPA or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board within the previous three years.</p>
                <p>B. In addition to any agreement made between the report acceptance body and the firm, the board may:</p>
                <p>(1) require that a partner, member, manager, shareholder, or employee of the firm complete continuing education in the areas of deficiency in addition to the continuing professional education hours required in part 1105.3000;</p>
                <p>(2) require that the firm maintain a minimum library of source materials designed to provide the firm with the resources necessary to cure the deficiencies noted; and</p>
                <p>(3) impose any other discipline authorized by Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08.</p>
                <p>C. In connection with the submission required by item A, the firm shall specifically notify the board if it has had two or more consecutive quality reviews of its nonpublic company attest or compilation client practice that resulted in the firm receiving a report that was other than pass. A firm's review shall result in one of three findings:</p>
                <p>(1) pass;</p>
                <p>(2) pass with deficiencies; or</p>

                <p>A. An application pursuant to part 1105.6100 must ordinarily be processed by the board upon the basis of the materials submitted in support of it, supplemented by any additional inquiries required by the board or its complaint committee.

                <p>C. In considering an application under part 1105.6100, the board may consider all activities of the applicant since the disciplinary penalty from which relief is sought was imposed, the offense for which the applicant was disciplined, the applicant's activities during the time the certificate, registration, privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, or permit was in good standing, the applicant's rehabilitative efforts, restitution to damaged parties in the matter for which the penalty was imposed, the applicant's general reputation for truth and professional probity, and factors described in part 1105.2450.</p>
                <p>D. No application for reinstatement may be considered while the applicant is under sentence for any criminal offense, including any period during which the applicant is on court-imposed probation or parole.</p>

                <p>A. A CPA firm name must not be used unless the name has been registered with and approved by the board.</p>
                <p>B. A CPA firm name is misleading within the meaning of Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.10, paragraph (h), if, among other things, the CPA firm name:</p>
                <p>(1) contains any representation that would be likely to cause a reasonable person to misunderstand or be confused about the legal form of the firm, or about who the owners or members of the firm are, such as a reference to a type of organization or abbreviation thereof which does not accurately reflect the form under which the firm is organized. This includes, but is not limited to, a name that:</p>
                <p>(a) implies the existence of a corporation when the firm is not a corporation such as through the use of the words "corporation," "incorporated," "LTD," "professional corporation," or an abbreviation thereof as part of the firm name if the firm is not incorporated or is not a professional corporation;</p>
                <p>(b) implies the existence of a partnership when there is not a partnership such as by use of the term "partnership" or "limited liability partnership," or the abbreviation "LLP" if the firm is not such an entity;</p>
                <p>(c) includes the name of an individual who is not a CPA if the title "CPAs" is included in the firm name;</p>
                <p>(d) includes information about or indicates an association with persons who are not members of the firm;</p>
                <p>(e) includes the terms "and company," "company," "and associate," "associates," "group," or abbreviators thereof, or similar names implying more than one employed licensee in the firm, but the firm does not include, in addition to the named licensee, at least one other unnamed licensee involved full time in the practice;</p>
                <p>(f) includes the name of a person who is neither a present nor past partner, member, or shareholder of the firm;</p>
                <p>(2) contains any representation that would be likely to cause a reasonable person to have a false or unjustified expectation of favorable results or capabilities, through the use of a false or unjustified statement of fact as to any material matters;</p>
                <p>(3) claims or implies the ability to influence a regulatory body or official; or</p>
                <p>(4) includes the name of an owner whose license has been revoked for disciplinary reasons by the board, whereby the licensee has been prohibited from practicing public accountancy or prohibited from using the title CPA or holding the licensee out as a certified public accountant.</p>
                <p>C. The following types of CPA firm names are not misleading and are permissible so long as they do not violate Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05:</p>
                <p>(1) a firm name that includes the names of one or more former or present owners;</p>
                <p>(2) a firm name that excludes the names of one or more former or present owners;</p>
                <p>(3) a firm name that uses the CPA title as part of the firm name when all named individuals are owners of the firm and who hold such title or are former owners who held such title at the time they ceased to be owners of the firm; or</p>
                <p>(4) a firm name that includes the name of a non-CPA owner if the CPA title is not part of the firm name.</p>
                <p>D. A network firm, as defined in the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct in effect July 1, 2011, may use a common brand name, or share common initials, as part of the firm name.</p>
                <p>E. A network firm, as defined in the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct in effect July 1, 2011, may use the network name as the firm's name provided it also shares one or more of the following characteristics with other firms in the network:</p>
                <p>(1) common control, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States among the firms through ownership, management, or other means;</p>
                <p>(2) profits or costs, excluding costs of operating the association, costs of developing audit methodologies, manuals and training courses, and other costs that are immaterial to the firm;</p>
                <p>(3) a common business strategy that involves ongoing collaboration amongst the firms whereby the firms are responsible for implementing the association's strategy and are held accountable for performance pursuant to the strategy;</p>
                <p>(4) a significant portion of professional resources; or</p>
                <p>(5) common quality control policies and procedures that participating firms are required to implement and that are monitored by the association.</p>
                <p>F. The firm name shall not include the name of a person who was a past partner, member, or shareholder of the firm if the person withdraws consent to the use or if the person becomes a partner, member, shareholder, or owner of a firm established under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05.</p>

                <p>A fictitious CPA firm name, that is, one not consisting of the names or initials of one or more present or former partners, members, or shareholders, may not be used by a CPA firm unless the name has been registered with and approved by the board as not being false or misleading.</p>
                <p>A firm name is considered false or misleading if:</p>
                <p>A. it is not the lawful and registered name of the firm;</p>
                <p>B. the name contains or fairly implies a misrepresentation of facts;</p>
                <p>C. the name indicates character or grade of service that is not based upon verifiable facts;</p>
                <p>D. the name is likely to mislead or deceive because it omits relevant facts. The following are examples, but are not inclusive:</p>
                <p>(1) the name indicates a geographic area of service which is not based on verifiable facts; or</p>
                <p>(2) the firm name includes a nonowner firm employee or the name or initials of any other nonowners, except as permitted in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.10, paragraph (h);</p>
                <p>E. the name is intended or likely to create false or unjustified expectations of favorable results;</p>
                <p>F. the name implies special expertise;</p>
                <p>G. the name implies educational or professional attainment or licensing recognition of the firm or of its owners, partners, or shareholders that are not supported in fact;</p>
                <p>H. the name of the firm that is incorporated does not include the words "corporation," "incorporated," "Ltd," "professional corporation," or "company," or an abbreviation thereof as part of the firm name and the name of a firm organized under the limited liability partnership statute does not include the words "limited liability company" or "limited liability partnership," as appropriate, or an abbreviation thereof, as part of the firm name;</p>
                <p>I. the name includes the designation "and company," "company," "group," "associates," or "and associates," or abbreviations thereof, or similar names implying more than one employed licensee in the firm, unless there are at least two licensees involved full time in the practice;</p>
                <p>J. the name of a firm that is a partnership or professional corporation fails to contain the personal name or names of one or more individuals presently or previously a partner, officer, or shareholder thereof, except that an acronym may be used for a firm name if the acronym is composed exclusively of the first letters of the surnames of current or past partners or shareholders of the firm;</p>
                <p>K. the name of a firm that is a sole proprietorship fails to contain the surname of the sole proprietor;</p>
                <p>L. the name contains other representations or implications that are likely to cause an ordinarily prudent person to misunderstand or to be deceived; or</p>

                <p><shortTitle>1105.<inline name="num">7450</inline> <b>MISLEADING RAP FIRM NAMES AND FICTITIOUS RAP FIRM NAMES.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>A. A RAP firm name must not be used unless the name has been registered with and approved by the board.</p>
                <p>B. A RAP firm name is misleading within the meaning of Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.10, paragraph (h), if the RAP firm name:</p>
                <p>(1) contains any representation that would be likely to cause a reasonable person to misunderstand or be confused about the legal form of the firm, or about who the owners or members of the firm are, such as a reference to a type of organization or abbreviation thereof which does not accurately reflect the form under which the firm is organized. This includes, but is not limited to, a name that:</p>
                <p>(a) implies the existence of a corporation when the firm is not a corporation such as through the use of the words "corporation," "incorporated," "LTD," "professional corporation," or an abbreviation thereof as part of the firm name if the firm is not incorporated or is not a professional corporation;</p>
                <p>(b) implies the existence of a partnership when there is not a partnership such as by use of the term "partnership" or "limited liability partnership," or the abbreviation "LLP" if the firm is not an LLP;</p>
                <p>(c) includes the name of an individual who is not a RAP if the title "RAPs" is included in the firm name;</p>
                <p>(d) includes the information about or indicates an association with persons who are not members of the firm;</p>
                <p>(e) includes the terms "and company," "and associate," or "group," but the firm does not include, in addition to the named partner, shareholder, owner, or member, at least one other unnamed partner, shareholder, owner, member, or staff employee; or</p>
                <p>(f) includes the name of a person who is neither a present nor past partner, member, or shareholder of the firm;</p>
                <p>(2) contains any representation that would be likely to cause a reasonable person to have a false or unjustified expectation of favorable results or capabilities, through the use of a false or unjustified statement of fact as to any material matters;</p>
                <p>(3) claims or implies the ability to influence a regulatory body or official; or</p>
                <p>(4) includes the name of an owner whose registration has been revoked for disciplinary reasons by the board, whereby the registrant has been prohibited from using the title RAP or from practicing or holding himself out as a registered accounting practitioner.</p>
                <p>C. The following types of RAP firm names are not misleading and are permissible so long as they do not violate Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05:</p>
                <p>(1) a firm that includes the names of one or more former or present owners;</p>
                <p>(2) a firm name that excludes the names of one or more former or present owners;</p>
                <p>(3) a firm name that uses the "RAP" title as part of the firm name when all named individuals are owners of the firm and who hold such title or are firm owners who held such title at the time they ceased to be owners of the firm; or</p>
                <p>(4) a firm name that includes the name of a non-RAP owner if the RAP title is not part of the firm name.</p>
                <p>D. A network firm as defined in the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct in effect July 1, 2011, may use a common brand name, or share common initials, as part of the firm name.</p>
                <p>E. A network firm, as defined in the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct in effect July 1, 2011, may use the network name as the firm's name provided it also shares one or more of the following characteristics with other firms in the network:</p>
                <p>(1) common control, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States among the firms through ownership, management, or other means;</p>
                <p>(2) profits or costs, excluding costs of operating the association, costs of developing audit methodologies, manuals and training courses, and other costs that are immaterial to the firm;</p>
                <p>(3) a common business strategy that involves ongoing collaboration among the firms whereby the firms are responsible for implementing the association's strategy and are held accountable for performance pursuant to the strategy;</p>
                <p>(4) a significant portion of professional resources; or</p>
                <p>(5) common quality control policies and procedures that participating firms are required to implement and that are monitored by the association.</p>
                <p>F. The firm name shall not include the name of a person who was a past partner, member, shareholder, or owner of the firm if the person withdraws consent to the inclusion or if the person becomes a partner, member, shareholder, or owner of a firm established under part 1105.7100.</p>
                <p>G. A fictitious RAP firm name, that is, one not consisting of the names or initials of one or more present or former partners, members, or shareholders, may not be used by a RAP firm unless the name has been registered with and approved by the board as not being false or misleading.</p>
                <p>A firm name is considered false or misleading if:</p>
                <p>(1) it is not the lawful and registered name of the firm;</p>
                <p>(2) the name contains or fairly implies a misrepresentation of facts;</p>
                <p>(3) the name indicates character or grade of service that is not based upon verifiable facts;</p>
                <p>(4) the name is likely to mislead or deceive because it omits relevant facts. The following are examples, but are not inclusive:</p>
                <p>(a) the name indicates a geographic area of service which is not based on verifiable facts; or</p>
                <p>(b) the firm name includes a nonowner firm employee or the name or initials of any other nonowner, except as permitted in Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.10, paragraph (h);</p>
                <p>(5) the name is intended or likely to create false or unjustified expectations of favorable results;</p>
                <p>(6) the name implies special expertise;</p>
                <p>(7) the name implies educational or professional attainment or licensing recognition of the firm or of its owners, partners, or shareholders that are not supported in fact;</p>
                <p>(8) the name of the firm that is incorporated does not include the words "corporation," "incorporated," "Ltd," "professional corporation," or "company," or an abbreviation thereof as part of the firm name and the name of a firm organized under the limited liability partnership statute does not include the words "limited liability company" or "limited liability partnership," as appropriate, or an abbreviation thereof, as part of the firm name;</p>
                <p>(9) the name includes the designation "and company," "company," "group," "associates," or "and associates," or abbreviations thereof or similar names implying more than one employed registrant in the firm, unless there are at least two registrants involved full time in the practice;</p>
                <p>(10) the name of a firm that is a partnership or professional corporation fails to contain the personal name or names of one or more individuals presently or previously a partner, officer, or shareholder thereof, except that an acronym may be used for a firm name if the acronym is composed exclusively of the first letters of the surnames of current or past partners or shareholders of the firm;</p>
                <p>(11) the name of a firm that is a sole proprietorship fails to contain the surname of the sole proprietor;</p>
                <p>(12) the name contains other representations or implications that are likely to cause an ordinarily prudent person to misunderstand or to be deceived; or</p>
                <p>(13) the name includes the name of an individual whose registration has been suspended or revoked by the board.</p>

                <p>B. Failure to report continuing professional education or falsely reporting continuing professional education required by parts 1105.3000 and 1105.7000 is an act discreditable to the profession and is basis for disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08.</p>
                <p>C. Failure to report peer reviews required by parts 1105.4000 and 1105.7100 or seeking an exemption when one is not warranted, is an act discreditable to the profession and is a basis for disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08.</p>

                <p>E. Persons and firms subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Public Law 107-204, shall comply with that act and related published rules. Failure to do so is an act discreditable to the profession and is basis for disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08.</p>
                <p>F. Persons and firms performing audit or attest services according to government auditing standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or auditing or related professional practice standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which documents are incorporated by reference, shall comply with those standards. Failure to do so is an act discreditable to the profession and is basis for disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08.</p>
                <p>G.

                <p>H. (1) A licensee, registrant, certificate holder, or applicant may not directly or indirectly take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead any certified public accounting firm, the state auditor, or the legislative auditor engaged in the performance of an audit of financial statements if that person knew or was unreasonable in not knowing that the action could, if successful, result in rendering the financial statements materially misleading. Engaging in these acts is an act discreditable to the profession and is a basis for disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08.</p>
                <p>(2) For purposes of this item, actions that "could, if successful, result in rendering the financial statements materially misleading" include, but are not limited to, the following actions taken at any time to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate, or mislead an auditor:</p>

                <p>I. A licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, shall not render services that do not follow the standards, as applicable under the circumstances and at the time the services are provided, specified in the documents in part 1105.0250. In addition to these applicable standards, and to the extent other provisions of this chapter and Minnesota Statutes do not modify or conflict with them, a licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, shall follow standards issued by other professional or governmental bodies including international standards setting bodies with which a licensee is required by law, regulation, or the terms of engagement to comply.</p>
                <p>J. (1) A licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, shall not for a commission recommend or refer to a client any product or service, or for a commission recommend or refer any product or service to be supplied by a client, or receive a commission, when the licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, also performs for that client:</p>
                <p>(a) an audit or review of a financial statement;</p>
                <p>(b) a compilation of a financial statement when the licensee expects, or reasonably might expect, that a third party will use the financial statement and the licensee's compilation report does not disclose a lack of independence; or</p>
                <p>(c) an examination of prospective financial information.</p>
                <p>This prohibition applies during the period in which the licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, is engaged to perform any of the services listed under this item and the period covered by any historical financial statements involved in these services.</p>
                <p>(2) A licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, who is not prohibited by this item from performing services for or receiving a commission and who is paid or expects to be paid a commission shall disclose that fact to any person or entity to whom the licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, recommends or refers a product or service to which the commission relates.</p>
                <p>(3) Any licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, who accepts a referral fee for recommending or referring any service of a licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, to any person or entity or who pays a referral fee to obtain a client shall disclose any acceptance or payment to the client.</p>
                <p>K. (1) A licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, shall not:</p>
                <p>(a) perform for a contingent fee any professional services for, or receive any fee from a client for whom the licensee, the licensee's firm, or an individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, performs:</p>
                <p>i. an audit or review of a financial statement;</p>
                <p>ii. a compilation of a financial statement when the licensee expects, or reasonably might expect, that a third party will use the financial statement and the licensee's compilation report does not disclose a lack of independence; or</p>
                <p>iii. an examination of prospective financial information; or</p>
                <p>(b) prepare an original or amended tax return or claim for a tax refund for a contingent fee for any client.</p>
                <p>(2) The prohibition in subitem (1) applies during the period in which the licensee or individual with practice privileges under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.14, is engaged to perform any of the services listed in this item and the period covered by any historical financial statements involved in any listed services.</p>
                <p>(3) A contingent fee is a fee established for the performance of any service pursuant to an arrangement in which no fee will be charged unless a specified finding or result is attained, or in which the amount of the fee is otherwise dependent upon the finding or result of such service. For purposes of this item, fees are not regarded as being contingent if fixed by courts or other public authorities, or, in tax matters, if determined based on the results of judicial proceedings or the findings of governmental agencies. A licensee's fees may vary depending, for example, on the complexity of services rendered.</p>

                <p>A. Firms granted permits under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.05, shall prepare, according to professional standards contained in AICPA Professional Standards, and retain for a period of not less than six years from the report date audit documentation in sufficient detail to support the conclusions reached in any report issued by the firm on the financial statements audited.</p>
                <p>B. The professional standards referred to in item A are incorporated by reference.</p>
                <p>C. Failure to comply with this part, or with all professional standards applicable to particular engagements, including, but not limited to, standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the Comptroller General of the United States, which are incorporated by reference in part 1105.0250, items D and E, respectively, is an act discreditable to the profession and is basis for disciplinary action under Minnesota Statutes, section 326A.08. The documentation and retention requirements in this part do not apply to engagements that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the Comptroller General of the United States. Unless otherwise stated in this part, firms shall comply with the documentation and retention requirements in this part in any other audit engagement performed for a client having its headquarters in this state.</p>
                <p>D. If audit documentation is required to be kept for longer than six years because of a pending board investigation or disciplinary action, audit documentation must not be destroyed until the licensee has been notified in writing by the board of the closure of a board investigation or disciplinary proceeding.</p>
                <p>E. Any documents required to be retained by this part must be retained in accessible form so that a reviewer may read the information contained in the documents.</p>
                <p>F. Licensees shall maintain and comply with an audit documentation retention and destruction policy that provides for the preservation of audit documentation for the full time period required by this part and provides for the authorized custody, security, access, retention, and destruction of the documentation. This policy must, at a minimum, include the following:</p>
                <p>(1) procedures for the maintenance of back-up copies of electronic audit documentation at secure locations;</p>
                <p>(2) procedures for maintaining audit documentation;</p>
                <p>(3) procedures for approving any changes to audit documentation; and</p>
                <p>(4) procedures for approving the destruction of documentation when no longer required to be maintained by this part.</p>
                <p>G. The audit documentation referred to in item A must include:</p>
                <p>(1) relevant workpapers containing documentation of auditing procedures applied, evidence obtained, and conclusions reached by the firm in the audit; and</p>
                <p>(2) other relevant documents that form the basis of the audit which:</p>
                <p>(a) are created, sent, or received in connection with the audit; and</p>
                <p>(b) contain conclusions, opinions, analyses, or financial data related to the audit.</p>
                <p>H. The following requirements apply to changes in audit documentation after delivery of the audit report to the client and such changes in documentation include any addition, removal, deletion, substitution, or editing of audit documentation, including, but not limited to, physical or electronic additions to any audit documentation file or preexisting audit documentation, occurring after the date of delivery of the audit report to the client which is supported by the audit documentation:</p>
                <p>(1) except as provided in subitem (2), in addition to any other documentation required by professional standards, the documentation must provide the identity of the person or persons making the change and identity of any person or persons approving the change, the date of the change, and the reason for the change if the reason is other than the assembling of preexisting documents. The documentation that is changed must contain sufficient detail to enable a reviewer with relevant knowledge and experience, having no previous connection with the audit engagement, to understand the nature, timing, reason for, and extent of the change; and</p>
                <p>(2) during a 60-day period after the date of delivery of the audit report to the client, documents may be added to the file for the assemblage and documentation of work previously performed. Nothing in this subitem authorizes the deferral of audit procedures required to be performed prior to the date of issuance of the report.</p>
