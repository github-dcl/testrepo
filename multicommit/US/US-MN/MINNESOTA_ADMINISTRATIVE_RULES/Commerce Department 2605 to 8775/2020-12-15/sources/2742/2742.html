      <h2 class="headnote">Description. </h2>
      <p>A coordination of benefits provision is one that is intended to avoid claims payment delays and duplication of benefits when a person is covered by two or more plans providing benefits or services for medical, dental, or other care or treatment. It avoids claims payment delays by establishing an order in which plans pay claims and providing authority for the orderly transfer of information needed to pay claims promptly. It avoids duplication of benefits by permitting a reduction of the benefits of a plan when, by the rules established by parts <a href="/rules/2742.0100">2742.0100</a> to <a href="/rules/2742.0400">2742.0400</a>, it does not have to pay its benefits first.</p>

      <p>If a group contract includes a coordination of benefits provision, it must be consistent with parts <a href="/rules/2742.0100">2742.0100</a> to <a href="/rules/2742.0400">2742.0400</a>. A plan that does not include such a provision may not take the benefits of another plan as defined in part <a href="/rules/2742.0200">2742.0200</a> into account when it determines its benefits. There is one exception: a contract holder's coverage that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the plan provided by the contract holder.</p>

      <p>"Plan" is a form of coverage with which coordination is allowed. The definition of plan in the group contract must state the types of coverage which will be considered in applying the coordination of benefits provision of that contract. The right to include a type of coverage is limited by the rest of this subpart.</p>
      <p>The definition in part <a href="/rules/2742.0300">2742.0300</a> is an example of what may be used. Any definition that satisfies this subpart may be used.</p>

        <p>"Plan" includes: group insurance and group subscriber contracts; uninsured arrangements of group or group-type coverage; group or group-type coverage through health maintenance organizations and other prepayment, group practice, and individual practice plans; and group-type contracts.</p>
        <p>Group-type contracts are contracts which are not available to the general public and can be obtained and maintained only because of membership in or connection with a particular organization or group. Group-type contracts answering this description may be included in the definition of plan, at the option of the insurer or the service provider and its contract-client, whether or not uninsured arrangements or individual contract forms are used and regardless of how the group-type coverage is designated (for example, "franchise" or "blanket"). The use of payroll deductions by the employee, subscriber, or member to pay for the coverage is not sufficient, of itself, to make an individual contract part of a group-type plan. This description of group-type contracts is not intended to include individually underwritten and issued, guaranteed renewable policies that may be purchased through payroll deduction at a premium savings to the insured.</p>
        <p>"Plan" may include the medical benefits coverage in group, group-type, and individual automobile "no-fault" and traditional automobile "fault" type contracts.</p>
        <p>"Plan" may include Medicare or other governmental benefits. That part of the definition of "plan" may be limited to the hospital, medical, and surgical benefits of the governmental program. However, "plan" shall not include a state plan under Medicaid, and shall not include a law or plan when, by law, its benefits are excess to those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan.</p>
        <p>The term "plan" shall not be construed to include group or group-type hospital indemnity benefits of $100 per day or less, but may be construed to include the amount by which group or group-type hospital indemnity benefits exceed $100 per day.</p>
        <p>"Plan" shall not include school accident-type coverages. These cover grammar, high school, and college students for accidents only, including athletic injuries, either on a 24-hour basis or on a "to and from school" basis.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Allowable expense. </h2>
      <p>"Allowable expense" is the necessary, reasonable, and customary item of expense for health care, when the item of expense is covered at least in part under any of the plans involved, except where a statute requires a different definition. However, items of expense under coverages such as dental care, vision care, prescription drugs, or hearing aid programs may be excluded from the definition of allowable expense. A plan which provides benefits only for any items of expense may limit its definition of allowable expenses to like items of expense.</p>
      <p>When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered as both an allowable expense and a benefit paid.</p>
      <p>When coordination of benefits is restricted in its use to a specific coverage in a contract (for example, major medical or dental), the definition of allowable expense must include the corresponding expenses or services to which coordination of benefits applies.</p>

      <p>"Claim determination period" means a period of time, which must not be less than 12 consecutive months, over which allowable expenses are compared with total benefits payable in the absence of coordination of benefits, to determine whether overinsurance exists; and how much each plan will pay or provide. Claim determination period does not mean the period of time in which a plan may take to pay.</p>
      <p>A claim determination period usually is a calendar year, but a plan may use some other period of time that fits the coverage of the group contract. A person may be covered by a plan during a portion of a claim determination period if that person's coverage starts or ends during that claim determination period.</p>
      <p>As each claim is submitted, each plan is to determine its liability and pay or provide benefits based upon allowable expenses incurred to that point in the claim determination period. A determination is subject to adjustment as later allowable expenses are incurred in the same claim determination period.</p>

      <p class="ce">COORDINATION OF THE GROUP CONTRACT'S BENEFITS WITH OTHER BENEFITS</p>
      <p>(I) APPLICABILITY.</p>
      <p>(A) This coordination of benefits provision applies to this plan when an employee or the employee's covered dependent has health care coverage under more than one plan. "Plan" and "this plan" are defined below.</p>
      <p>(B) If this coordination of benefits provision applies, the order of benefit determination rules should be looked at first. Those rules determine whether the benefits of this plan are determined before or after those of another plan. The benefits of this plan:</p>
      <p>(i) shall not be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, this plan determines its benefits before another plan; but</p>
      <p>(ii) may be reduced when, under the order of benefit determination rules, another plan determines its benefits first. The above reduction is described in section (IV) Effect on the Benefits of This Plan.</p>
      <p>(II) DEFINITIONS.</p>
      <p>(A) A "plan" is any of these which provides benefits or services for, or because of, medical or dental care or treatment:</p>
      <p>(i) Group insurance or group-type coverage, whether insured or uninsured. This includes prepayment, group practice, or individual practice coverage. It also includes coverage other than school accident-type coverage.</p>
      <p>(ii) Coverage under a governmental plan or required or provided by law. This does not include a state plan under Medicaid (Title XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the United States Social Security Act as amended from time to time). It also does not include any plan when, by law, its benefits are excess to those of any private insurance program or other nongovernmental program.</p>
      <p>Each contract or other arrangement for coverage under (i) or (ii) is a separate plan. Also, if an arrangement has two parts and coordination of benefits rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is a separate plan.</p>
      <p>(B) "This plan" is the part of the group contract that provides benefits for health care expenses.</p>
      <p>(C) "Primary plan/secondary plan." The order of benefit determination rules state whether this plan is a primary plan or secondary plan as to another plan covering the person.</p>
      <p>When this plan is a primary plan, its benefits are determined before those of the other plan and without considering the other plan's benefits.</p>
      <p>When this plan is a secondary plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other plan and may be reduced because of the other plan's benefits.</p>
      <p>When there are more than two plans covering the person, this plan may be a primary plan as to one or more other plans, and may be a secondary plan as to a different plan or plans.</p>
      <p>(D) "Allowable expense" means a necessary, reasonable, and customary item of expense for health care, when the item of expense is covered at least in part by one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is made.</p>
      <p>The difference between the cost of a private hospital room and the cost of a semiprivate hospital room is not considered an allowable expense under the above definition unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is medically necessary either in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or as specifically defined in the plan.</p>
      <p>When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an allowable expense and a benefit paid.</p>
      <p>(E) "Claim determination period" means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage under this plan, or any part of a year before the date this coordination of benefits provision or a similar provision takes effect.</p>
      <p>(III) ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES.</p>
      <p>(A) General. When there is a basis for a claim under this plan and another plan, this plan is a secondary plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other plan, unless:</p>
      <p>(i) the other plan has rules coordinating its benefits with those of this plan; and</p>
      <p>(ii) both those rules and this plan's rules, in subparagraph (B) below, require that this plan's benefits be determined before those of the other plan.</p>
      <p>(B) Rules. This plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules which applies:</p>
      <p>(i) Nondependent/dependent. The benefits of the plan which covers the person as an employee, member, or subscriber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the plan which covers the person as a dependent.</p>
      <p>(ii) Dependent child/parents not separated or divorced. Except as stated in subparagraph (B)(iii) below, when this plan and another plan cover the same child as a dependent of different persons, called "parents":</p>
      <p>a. the benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but</p>
      <p>b. if both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time.</p>
      <p>However, if the other plan does not have the rule described in a. above, but instead has a rule based upon the gender of the parent, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other plan will determine the order of benefits.</p>
      <p>(iii) Dependent child/separated or divorced parents. If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined in this order:</p>
      <p>a. first, the plan of the parent with custody of the child;</p>
      <p>b. then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child; and</p>
      <p>c. finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child.</p>
      <p>However, if the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any claim determination period or plan year during which any benefits are actually paid or provided before the entity has that actual knowledge.</p>
      <p>(iv) Active/inactive employee. The benefits of a plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or as that employee's dependent) are determined before those of a plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent). If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, (iv) is ignored.</p>
      <p>(v) Longer/shorter length of coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered an employee, member, or subscriber longer are determined before those of the plan which covered that person for the shorter time.</p>
      <p>(IV) EFFECT ON THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLAN.</p>
      <p>(A) When this section applies. This section applies when, in accordance with section (III) Order of Benefit Determination Rules, this plan is a secondary plan as to one or more other plans. In that event the benefits of this plan may be reduced under this section. Such other plan or plans are referred to as "the other plans" in (B) below.</p>
      <p>(B) Reduction in this plan's benefits. The benefits of this plan will be reduced when the sum of:</p>
      <p>(i) the benefits that would be payable for the allowable expenses under this plan in the absence of this coordination of benefits provision; and</p>
      <p>(ii) the benefits that would be payable for the allowable expenses under the other plans, in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this coordination of benefits provision, whether or not claim is made; exceeds those allowable expenses in a claim determination period. In that case, the benefits of this plan will be reduced so that they and the benefits payable under the other plans do not total more than those allowable expenses.</p>
      <p>When the benefits of this plan are reduced as described above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this plan.</p>
      <p>(V) RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION.</p>
      <p>Certain facts are needed to apply these coordination of benefits rules. [The XYZ Company] has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. [The XYZ Company] need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this unless applicable federal or state law prevents disclosure of the information without the consent of the patient or the patient's representative. Each person claiming benefits under this plan must give [The XYZ Company] any facts it needs to pay the claim.</p>
      <p>(VI) FACILITY OF PAYMENT.</p>
      <p>A payment made under another plan may include an amount which should have been paid under this plan. If it does, [The XYZ Company] may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this plan. [The XYZ Company] will not have to pay that amount again. The term "payment made" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case "payment made" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services.</p>
      <p>(VII) RIGHT OF RECOVERY.</p>
      <p>If the amount of the payments made by [The XYZ Company] is more than it should have paid under this coordination of benefits provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of:</p>
      <p>(A) the persons it has paid or for whom it has paid;</p>
      <p>(B) insurance companies; or</p>
      <p>(C) other organizations.</p>
      <p>The "amount of the payments made" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services.</p>

      <p>The word "birthday" in the wording shown in subsection (4)(d)(III)(B)(ii) of part <a href="/rules/2742.0300">2742.0300</a>, subpart 4 refers only to month and day in a calendar year, not the year in which the person was born.</p>
      <p>A group contract which includes coordination of benefits and which is issued or renewed, or which has an anniversary date of July 5, 1986, shall include the substance of the provision in subsection (4)(d)(III)(B)(ii) of part <a href="/rules/2742.0300">2742.0300</a>, subpart 4.

      <p>The claimant's length of time covered under a plan is measured from the claimant's first date of coverage under that plan.

        <p> Alternative 1, total allowable expenses. When this alternative is used, a secondary plan may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all plans during a claim determination period are not more than total allowable expenses. The amount by which the secondary plan's benefits have been reduced shall be used by the secondary plan to pay allowable expenses, not otherwise paid, which were incurred during the claim determination period by the person for whom the claim is made. As each claim is submitted, the secondary plan determines its obligation to pay for allowable expenses based on all claims which were submitted up to that point in time during the claim determination period.</p>

        <p> Alternative 2, total allowable expenses with coinsurance. When this alternative is used, a secondary plan may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all plans during a claim determination period are not more than a stated percentage, but not less than 80 percent, of total allowable expenses. The amount by which the secondary plan's benefits have been reduced shall be used by the secondary plan to pay the stated percentage of allowable expenses, not otherwise paid, which were incurred during the claim determination period by the person for whom the claim is made. As each claim is submitted, the secondary plan determines its obligation to pay for the stated percentage of allowable expenses based on all claims which were submitted up to that point in time during the claim determination period.</p>
        <p>When this alternative is used, the suggested contract provision for use in part <a href="/rules/2742.0300">2742.0300</a>, subpart 4, (IV)(B) is as follows:</p>
        <p>The benefits of this plan will be reduced when the sum of: (a) the benefits that would be payable for the allowable expenses under this plan in the absence of this coordination of benefits provision; and (b) the benefits that would be payable for the allowable expenses under the other plans in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this coordination of benefits provision, whether or not claim is made; exceeds the greater of (i) 80 percent of those allowable expenses or (ii) the amount of the benefits in (a). In that case, the benefits of this plan will be reduced so that they and the benefits in (b) do not total more than the greater of (i) and (ii).</p>
        <p>When the benefits of this plan are reduced as described above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this plan.</p>

        <p> Alternative 3, maintenance of benefits. When this alternative is used, a secondary plan may reduce its benefits by the amount of the benefits payable under the other plans for the same expenses.</p>
        <p>When this alternative is used, the suggested contract provision for use in part <a href="/rules/2742.0300">2742.0300</a>, subpart 4, (IV)(B) is shown below.</p>
        <p>The benefits that would be payable under this plan in the absence of this coordination of benefits provision will be reduced by the benefits payable under the other plans for the expenses covered in whole or in part under this plan. This applies whether or not claim is made under a plan.</p>
        <p>When a plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be considered both an expense incurred and a benefit payable.</p>
        <p>When the benefits of this plan are reduced as described above, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this plan.</p>
        <p>The paragraph immediately above may be omitted if the plan provides only one benefit, or may be altered to suit the coverage provided.</p>
        <p>This alternative may be used in a plan only when, in the absence of coordination of benefits, the benefits of the plan (excluding benefits for dental care, vision care, prescription drugs, or hearing aid programs) will, after any deductible, be not less than 50 percent of covered expenses for the treatment of mental or nervous disorders or alcoholism or drug abuse, or under cost containment provisions with alternative benefits, such as those applicable to second surgical opinions, precertification of hospital stays, etc.; and not less than 75 percent of other covered expenses.</p>

        <p> If the person is enrolled before the end of the 31-day period, there shall be no interruption of coverage. Thus, the requirements concerning active work of employees, members, or subscribers, or nonconfinement of dependents on the effective date of coverage, shall not be applied. However, coverage for the person under the plan may be subject to the same requirements including underwriting requirements, benefit restrictions, waiting periods, and preexisting condition limitations that would have applied had the person been enrolled under the plan on the later of (a) the date the person first became eligible for the plan's coverage; or (b) the date the employee, member, or subscriber last became covered under the plan.</p>
        <p>Credit shall be given under any preexisting condition limitation or waiting period from the later of the dates described in (a) or (b) to the date the person actually enrolled pursuant to the unrestricted enrollment provisions above.</p>

        <p> A secondary plan which provides benefits in the form of services may recover the reasonable cash value of providing the services from the primary plan, to the extent that benefits for the services are covered by the primary plan and have not already been paid or provided by the primary plan. Nothing in this provision shall be interpreted to require a plan to reimburse a covered person in cash for the value of services provided by a plan which provides benefits in the form of services.</p>

        <p> If the noncomplying plan does not provide the information needed by the complying plan to determine its benefits within a reasonable time after it is requested to do so, the complying plan shall assume that the benefits of the noncomplying plan are identical to its own, and shall pay its benefits accordingly.

        <p> If the noncomplying plan reduces its benefits so that the employee, subscriber, or member receives less in benefits than he or she would have received had the complying plan paid or provided its benefits as the secondary plan and the noncomplying plan paid or provided its benefits as the primary plan; and governing state law allows the right of subrogation in subpart 8; then the complying plan shall advance to or on behalf of the employee, subscriber, or member an amount equal to the difference. However, in no event shall the complying plan advance more than the complying plan would have paid had it been the primary plan less any amount it previously paid. In consideration of such advance, the complying plan shall be subrogated to all rights of the employee, subscriber, or member against the noncomplying plan. An advance by the complying plan shall also be without prejudice to any claim it may have against the noncomplying plan in the absence of subrogation.</p>
