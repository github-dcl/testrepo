The chairperson shall place the request for reconsideration and petition for rehearing on the agenda for the board meeting next following the meeting at which the decision was made. The petition must contain the name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner; the board designation for the matter; and the reasons for the petition.</p>
                  <p>A petition for rehearing submitted after a final decision on the matter has been reached by the board may not be acted upon unless the board has first decided to reconsider its decision. Absent a motion by a board member to reconsider at the board meeting next following the board meeting at which the decision was made, the request for reconsideration and the petition for rehearing is deemed to be denied. The board shall grant or deny a petition for rehearing as part of the record of the decision. This petition must be granted upon a showing that there are irregularities in the hearing which affected the outcome of a hearing, errors of law, or that there is newly discovered material evidence of such importance it would have likely altered the outcome of the hearing. A rehearing petition must also be granted upon a showing of good cause for failure to have answered or appeared at the hearing.</p>
                  <p>A rehearing must be noticed and conducted in the same manner as the original hearing or contested case on a matter; provided that, in a contested case, the administrative law judge may permit service of the notice less than 30 days prior to the rehearing of a contested case.</p>

                  <p>"Cumulative potential effects" means the effect on the environment that results from the incremental effects of a project in addition to other projects in the environmentally relevant area that might reasonably be expected to affect the same environmental resources, including future projects actually planned or for which a basis of expectation has been laid, regardless of what person undertakes the other projects or what jurisdictions have authority over the projects. Significant cumulative potential effects can result from individually minor projects taking place over a period of time. In analyzing the contributions of past projects to cumulative potential effects, it is sufficient to consider the current aggregate effects of past actions. It is not required to list or analyze the impacts of individual past actions, unless such information is necessary to describe the cumulative potential effects. In determining if a basis of expectation has been laid for a project, an RGU must determine whether a project is reasonably likely to occur and, if so, whether sufficiently detailed information is available about the project to contribute to the understanding of cumulative potential effects. In making these determinations, the RGU must consider: whether any applications for permits have been filed with any units of government; whether detailed plans and specifications have been prepared for the project; whether future development is indicated by adopted comprehensive plans or zoning or other ordinances; whether future development is indicated by historic or forecasted trends; and any other factors determined to be relevant by the RGU.</p>

                  <p>The Minnesota Environmental Policy Act recognizes that the restoration and maintenance of environmental quality is critically important to our welfare. The act also recognizes that human activity has a profound and often adverse impact on the environment.</p>
                  <p>A first step in achieving a more harmonious relationship between human activity and the environment is understanding the impact which a proposed project will have on the environment. The purpose of parts 4410.0200 to 4410.6500 is to aid in providing that understanding through the preparation and public review of environmental documents.</p>
                  <p>Environmental documents shall contain information that addresses the significant environmental issues of a proposed action. This information shall be available to governmental units and citizens early in the decision making process.</p>
                  <p>Environmental documents shall not be used to justify a decision, nor shall indications of adverse environmental effects necessarily require that a project be disapproved. Environmental documents shall be used as guides in issuing, amending, and denying permits and carrying out other responsibilities of governmental units to avoid or minimize adverse environmental effects and to restore and enhance environmental quality.</p>

                  <p>The process created by parts 4410.0200 to 4410.6500 is designed to:</p>
                  <p>A. provide usable information to the project proposer, governmental decision makers and the public concerning the primary environmental effects of a proposed project;</p>
                  <p>B. provide the public with systematic access to decision makers, which will help to maintain public awareness of environmental concerns and encourage accountability in public and private decision making;</p>
                  <p>C. delegate authority and responsibility for environmental review to the governmental unit most closely involved in the project;</p>

                  <p>All projects requiring an EIS must have an EAW filed with the RGU. The EAW shall be the basis for the scoping process.</p>
                  <p>For projects which fall within a mandatory EIS category or if a voluntary EIS is planned, the EAW will be used solely as a scoping document. For such projects, the RGU shall prepare and circulate with the EAW a draft scoping decision document that addresses the contents specified by subpart 6 to the extent that information is already available. The purpose of the draft scoping decision document is to facilitate the delineation of issues and analyses to be contained in the EIS. The information in a draft scoping decision document shall be considered as preliminary and subject to revision based on the entire record of the scoping process.</p>
                  <p>If the need for an EIS has not been determined the EAW will have two functions:</p>
                  <p>A. to identify the need for preparing an EIS pursuant to part 4410.1700; and</p>
                  <p>B. to initiate discussion concerning the scope of the EIS if an EIS is ordered pursuant to part 4410.1700.</p>

                <p>An EIS shall be written in plain and objective language. An RGU shall use a format for an EIS that will encourage good analysis and clear presentation of the proposed action including alternatives to the project. The standard format shall be:</p>
                <p>A. Cover sheet: the cover sheet shall include:</p>
                <p>(1) the RGU;</p>
                <p>(2) the title of the proposed project that is the subject of the statement and, if appropriate, the titles of related actions, together with each county or other jurisdictions, if applicable, where the project is located;</p>
                <p>(3) the name, address, and telephone number of the person at the RGU who can supply further information;</p>
                <p>(4) the name and address of the proposer and the name, address, and telephone number of the proposer's representative who can supply further information;</p>
                <p>(5) a designation of the statement as a draft, final, or supplement;</p>
                <p>(6) a one paragraph abstract of the EIS; and</p>
                <p>(7) if appropriate, the date of the public meeting on the draft EIS and the date following the meeting by which comments on the draft EIS must be received by the RGU.</p>
                <p>B. Summary: the summary shall stress the major findings, areas of controversy, and the issues to be resolved including the choice among alternatives.</p>
                <p>C. Table of contents: the table shall be used to assist readers to locate material.</p>
                <p>D. List of preparers: this list shall include the names and qualifications of the persons who were primarily responsible for preparing the EIS or significant background papers.</p>
                <p>E. Project description: the proposed project shall be described with no more detail than is absolutely necessary to allow the public to identify the purpose of the project, its size, scope, environmental setting, geographic location, and the anticipated phases of development.</p>
                <p>F. Governmental approvals: this section shall list all known governmental permits and approvals required including identification of the governmental unit which is responsible for each permit or approval. Those permits for which all necessary information has been gathered and presented in the EIS shall be identified.</p>
                <p>G. Alternatives: the EIS shall compare the potentially significant impacts of the proposal with those of other reasonable alternatives to the proposed project. The EIS must address one or more alternatives of each of the following types of alternatives or provide a concise explanation of why no alternative of a particular type is included in the EIS: alternative sites, alternative technologies, modified designs or layouts, modified scale or magnitude, and alternatives incorporating reasonable mitigation measures identified through comments received during the comment periods for EIS scoping or for the draft EIS. An alternative may be excluded from analysis in the EIS if it would not meet the underlying need for or purpose of the project, it would likely not have any significant environmental benefit compared to the project as proposed, or another alternative, of any type, that will be analyzed in the EIS would likely have similar environmental benefits but substantially less adverse economic, employment, or sociological impacts. Alternatives included in the scope of the EIS as established under part 4410.2100 that were considered but eliminated based on information developed through the EIS analysis shall be discussed briefly and the reasons for their elimination shall be stated. The alternative of no action shall be addressed.</p>
                <p>H. Environmental, economic, employment, and sociological impacts: for the proposed project and each major alternative there shall be a thorough but succinct discussion of potentially significant adverse or beneficial effects generated, be they direct, indirect, or cumulative. Data and analyses shall be commensurate with the importance of the impact and the relevance of the information to a reasoned choice among alternatives and to the consideration of the need for mitigation measures; the RGU shall consider the relationship between the cost of data and analyses and the relevance and importance of the information in determining the level of detail of information to be prepared for the EIS. Less important material may be summarized, consolidated, or simply referenced. The EIS shall identify and briefly discuss any major differences of opinion concerning significant impacts of the proposed project on the environment.</p>
                <p>I. Mitigation measures: this section shall identify those measures that could reasonably eliminate or minimize any adverse environmental, economic, employment, or sociological effects of the proposed project.</p>
                <p>J. Appendix: if a RGU prepares an appendix to an EIS the appendix shall include, when applicable:</p>
                <p>(1) material prepared in connection with the EIS, as distinct from material which is not so prepared and which is incorporated by reference;</p>
                <p>(2) material which substantiates any analysis fundamental to the EIS; and</p>
                <p>(3) permit information that was developed and gathered concurrently with the preparation of the EIS. The information may be presented on the permitting agency's permit application forms. The appendix may reference information for the permit included in the EIS text or the information may be included within the appendix, as appropriate. If the permit information cannot conveniently be incorporated into the EIS, the EIS may simply indicate the location where the permit information may be reviewed.</p>

At the time of its permit decision, for those permits that were identified during the scoping process as requiring a record of decision, each permitting unit of government shall prepare a concise public record of how it considered the EIS in its decision. That record shall be supplied to the EQB for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of the process created by parts 4410.0200 to 4410.6500 and to any other person requesting the information.

                  <p>(2) there is substantial new information or new circumstances that significantly affect the potential environmental effects from the proposed project that have not been considered in the final EIS or that significantly affect the availability of prudent and feasible alternatives with lesser environmental effects;</p>

                  <p>A supplement to an EIS shall be prepared, circulated, and reviewed according to the procedures in items A to E.</p>
                  <p>A. The scope of a supplement to an EIS must be limited to impacts, alternatives, and mitigation measures not addressed or inadequately addressed in the final EIS. The RGU shall adopt a scope for the supplement as part of the preparation notice. The RGU may consult with any person in order to obtain information relevant to the scoping of a supplement, and may hold public meetings to obtain the information. Reasonable notice must be given of any meetings. All meetings must be open to the public.</p>
                  <p>B. The RGU shall adopt and distribute a notice of the preparation of the supplement to the EIS. The notice must contain:</p>
                  <p>(1) the title of the EIS being supplemented and its approximate date of completion;</p>
                  <p>(2) a brief description of the situation necessitating the preparation of the supplement, including a description of how the changes in the proposed project or new information may affect the potential significant environmental effects from the project or the availability of prudent and feasible alternatives;</p>
                  <p>(3) the scope of the supplement including issues to be analyzed, alternatives to be examined, and studies to be undertaken; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the proposed time schedule for the preparation of the supplement.</p>
                  <p>The preparation notice must be distributed to all persons who received the final EIS, to all persons on the EAW distribution list under part 4410.1500, and to any person who requested that a supplement be prepared under subpart 4, provided that if more than one person signed a letter or other document requesting a supplement, notice need only be distributed to their representative or to the person whose signature first appears on the document. The EQB shall publish a summary of the preparation notice in the EQB Monitor.</p>
                  <p>If, within 20 days of publication of the preparation notice in the EQB Monitor, any person submits written comments to the RGU objecting to the scope of the supplement, the RGU shall give due consideration to modifying its scope based on the comments. The RGU shall include in the draft supplement document a copy of any timely comments received objecting to the scope and its response to the comments.</p>
                  <p>C. The RGU shall prepare a draft supplement for the purposes of receiving public comments. The draft document must conform to the requirements of parts 4410.2300, items D to J, 4410.2400, and 4410.2500. The draft supplement must be distributed and reviewed in accordance with part 4410.2600, subparts 2 to 10, except that the informational meeting must be held not less than ten days after publication of notice in the EQB Monitor.</p>
                  <p>D. The RGU shall prepare and distribute a final supplement to an EIS in accordance with part 4410.2700.</p>
                  <p>E. The determination of adequacy of the final supplement to an EIS must be made in accordance with part 4410.2800.</p>

Tiering of information from the original EIS may be used to minimize duplication of paperwork, provided that the original EIS is reasonably available for public and agency review.</p>

                  <p>Governmental units may request EQB approval of an alternative form of environmental review for categories of projects which undergo environmental review under other governmental processes. The governmental processes must address substantially the same issues as the EAW and EIS process and use procedures similar in effect to those of the EAW and EIS process. The EQB shall approve the governmental process as an alternative form of environmental review if the governmental unit demonstrates the process meets the following conditions:</p>
                  <p>A. the process identifies the potential environmental impacts of each proposed project;</p>
                  <p>B. the aspects of the process that are intended to substitute for an EIS process address substantially the same issues as an EIS and uses procedures similar to those used in preparing an EIS but in a more timely or more efficient manner;</p>
                  <p>C. alternatives to the proposed project are considered in light of their potential environmental impacts in those aspects of the process that are intended to substitute for an EIS process;</p>
                  <p>D. measures to mitigate the potential environmental impacts are identified and discussed;</p>
                  <p>E. a description of the proposed project and analysis of potential impacts, alternatives (in those aspects of the process intended to substitute for an EIS), and mitigating measures are provided to other affected or interested governmental units and the general public;</p>
                  <p>F. the governmental unit shall provide notice of the availability of environmental documents to the general public in at least the area affected by the project (a copy of environmental documents on projects reviewed under an alternative review procedure shall be submitted to the EQB; the EQB shall be responsible for publishing notice of the availability of the documents in the EQB Monitor);</p>
                  <p>G. other governmental units and the public are provided with a reasonable opportunity to request environmental review and to review and comment on the information concerning the project (the process must provide for RGU response to timely substantive comments relating to issues discussed in environmental documents relating to the project); and</p>
                  <p>H. the process must routinely develop the information required in items A to E and provide the notification and review opportunities in items F and G for each project that would be subject to environmental review.</p>

On approval of the alternative review process, the EQB shall provide for periodic review of the alternative procedure to ensure continuing compliance with the requirements and intent of these environmental review procedures. The EQB shall withdraw its approval of an alternative review procedure if review of the procedure indicates that the procedure no longer fulfills the intent and requirements of the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act and parts 4410.0200 to 4410.6500. A project in the process of undergoing review under an approved alternative process shall not be affected by the EQB's withdrawal of approval.</p>

                  <p>A local unit of government may use the procedures of this part instead of the procedures of parts 4410.1100 to 4410.1700 and 4410.2100 to 4410.3000 to review anticipated residential, commercial, warehousing, and light industrial development and associated infrastructure in a particular geographic area within its jurisdiction, if the local unit has adopted a comprehensive plan that includes at least the elements in items A to C. The procedures of this part may not be used to review any project meeting the requirements for a mandatory EAW in part 4410.4300, subparts 2 to 13, 15 to 17, 18, item C, D, or E, or 24, or a mandatory EIS in part 4410.4400, subparts 2 to 10, 12, 13, or 25. The local unit of government is the RGU for any review conducted under this part.</p>
                  <p>A. A land use plan designating the existing and proposed location, intensity, and extent of use of land and water for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and other public and private purposes.</p>
                  <p>B. A public facilities plan describing the character, location, timing, sequence, function, use, and capacity of existing and future public facilities of the local governmental unit. The public facilities plan must include at least the following parts:</p>
                  <p>(1) a transportation plan describing, designating, and scheduling the location, extent, function, and capacity of existing and proposed local public and private transportation facilities and services; and</p>
                  <p>(2) a sewage collection system policy plan describing, designating, and scheduling the areas to be served by the public system, the existing and planned capacities of the public system, and the standards and conditions under which the installation of private sewage treatment systems will be permitted.</p>
                  <p>C. An implementation program describing public programs, fiscal devices, and other actions to be undertaken to implement the comprehensive plan. The implementation plan must include a description of official controls addressing the matters of zoning, subdivision, and private sewage treatment systems, a schedule for the implementation of those controls, and a capital improvements program for public facilities.</p>
                  <p>A local governmental unit that has an adopted comprehensive plan that lacks any of the elements required by this subpart may qualify for the use of the procedures of this part upon a demonstration to the EQB chair that the lacking element would have no substantial effect on the purpose of or outcome of the environmental review and upon receiving authorization from the EQB chair to use these procedures.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">2</inline>. <b>Relationship to specific development projects.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. Upon completion of review under this part, residential, commercial, warehousing, and light industrial development projects and associated infrastructure within the boundaries established under subpart 3 that are consistent with development assumptions established under subpart 3 are exempt from review under parts 4410.1100 to 4410.1700 and 4410.2100 to 4410.3000 as long as the approval and construction of the project complies with the conditions of the plan for mitigation developed under subpart 5.</p>
                  <p>B. The prohibitions of part 4410.3100, subparts 1 and 2, apply to all projects for which review under this part substitutes for review under parts 4410.1100 to 4410.1700 or 4410.2100 to 4410.3000. These prohibitions terminate upon the adoption by the RGU of the environmental analysis document and plan for mitigation under subpart 5.</p>
                  <p>C. If a specific residential, commercial, warehousing, light industrial, or associated infrastructure project, that is subject to an EAW or EIS, is proposed within the boundaries of an area for which an alternative review under this part is planned or is in preparation but has not yet been completed, the RGU may, at its discretion, review the specific project either through the alternative areawide review procedures or through the EAW or EIS procedures. If the project is reviewed through the alternative areawide review procedures, at least one set of development assumptions used in the process must be consistent with the proposed project, and the project must incorporate the applicable mitigation measures developed through the process.</p>
                  <p>D. The ordering of a review pursuant to subpart 3 does not constitute a finding by the RGU that each potential project within the designated boundary has or may have the potential for significant environmental effects. After an order for review has been adopted under subpart 3, if a specific project for which an EAW or EIS is not mandatory is proposed within the boundaries of the review area, the RGU may exclude the project from the review process and proceed with its approval by using the following process. The RGU must provide notice of the intended exclusion and the reasons for the intended exclusion in the same manner as for distribution of an EAW pursuant to part 4410.1500. Agencies and interested persons shall have ten days from the date of the notice in the <i>EQB Monitor</i> to file comments with the RGU about the proposed removal of the project from the review. If no adverse comments are received within the comment period, the project is automatically excluded from the review and the prohibitions under part 4410.3100 do not apply to the project without further action by the RGU. If adverse comments are received, the RGU must consider the comments and determine whether to include the project in the review or to exclude it within 30 days of the end of the comment period based on whether the project may have the potential for significant environmental effects, taking into account the comments received and the interaction of the project with other anticipated development in its surrounding area.</p>
                  <p>E. If a specific project will be reviewed through the procedures of this part rather than through the EAW or EIS procedures and the project itself would otherwise require preparation of an EIS pursuant to part 4410.4400 or will comprise at least 50 percent of the geographic area to be reviewed, the RGU must follow the additional procedures of subpart 5a in the review.</p>

                  <p>The RGU shall adopt an order for each review under this part that specifies the boundaries of the geographic area within which the review will apply and specifies the anticipated nature, location, and intensity of residential, commercial, warehousing, and light industrial development and associated infrastructure within those boundaries. The RGU may specify more than one scenario of anticipated development provided that at least one scenario is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan. At least one scenario must be consistent with any known development plans of property owners within the area. The RGU may delineate subareas within the area, as appropriate to facilitate planning and review of future development, and allocate the overall anticipated development among the subareas.</p>

                  <p>The procedures in items A to H must be used for review under this part.</p>
                  <p>A. The RGU shall prepare a draft environmental analysis document addressing each of the development scenarios selected under subpart 3 using the standard content and format provided by the EQB under subpart 4. A draft version of the mitigation plan as described under item C must be included. The geographic extent of the analyses of direct, indirect, and cumulative potential effects conducted in preparing the document is not to be limited by the boundaries set in the order for review under subpart 3. The draft document must be distributed and noticed in accordance with part 4410.1500.</p>
                  <p>B. Reviewers shall have 30 days from the date of notice of availability of the draft environmental analysis in the EQB Monitor to submit written comments to the RGU. Reviewers that are governmental units shall be granted a 15-day extension by the RGU upon a written request for good cause. A copy of the request must be sent to the EQB.</p>
                  <p>Comments may address the accuracy and completeness of the information provided in the draft analysis and draft mitigation plan, potential impacts that warrant further analysis, further information that may be required in order to secure permits for specific projects in the future, mitigation measures or procedures necessary to prevent significant environmental impacts within the area when actual development occurs, and the need to analyze additional development scenarios as required by this part.</p>
                  <p>Governmental units shall also state in their comments whether or not they wish to be notified by the RGU upon receipt of applications for specific development projects within the area.</p>
                  <p>C. The RGU shall revise the environmental analysis document based on comments received during the comment period. The RGU shall include in the document a section specifically responding to each timely, substantive comment received that indicates in what way the comment has been addressed. If the RGU believes a request for additional analysis is unreasonable, it may consult with the EQB chair before responding to the comment.</p>
                  <p>The RGU shall include in the document a plan for mitigation specifying the mitigation measures that will be imposed upon future development within the area in order to avoid or mitigate potential environmental impacts. The plan shall contain a description of how each mitigation measure will be implemented, including a description of the involvement of other agencies, if appropriate.</p>
                  <p>D. The RGU shall distribute the revised environmental analysis document, including the plan for mitigation, in the same manner as the draft document and also to any persons who commented on the draft document and to the EQB staff. State agencies and the Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities have ten days from the date of receipt of the revised document to file an objection to the document with the RGU. A copy of any letter of objection must be filed with the EQB staff. An objection may be filed only if the agency filing the objection has evidence that the revised document contains inaccurate or incomplete information relevant to the identification and mitigation of potentially significant environmental impacts, that the review has not analyzed sufficient development scenarios as required by this part, or that the proposed plan for mitigation will be inadequate to prevent potentially significant environmental impacts from occurring.</p>
                  <p>E. Unless an objection is filed in accordance with item D, the RGU shall adopt the revised environmental analysis document, including the plan for mitigation, at its first regularly scheduled meeting held 15 or more days after the distribution of the revised document. The RGU shall submit evidence of the adoption of the document and plan for mitigation to the EQB staff and all agencies that have stated that they wish to be informed of any future projects within the area as part of their comments on the draft environmental analysis document. The EQB shall publish a notice of the adoption of the document and the completion of the review process in the EQB Monitor.</p>
                  <p>Upon adoption of the environmental analysis document, including the plan for mitigation, residential, commercial, warehousing, and light industrial projects and associated infrastructure within the area that are consistent with the assumptions of the document and that comply with the plan for mitigation are exempt from review under parts 4410.1100 to 4410.1700 and 4410.2100 to 4410.2800.</p>
                  <p>F. If an objection is filed with the RGU in accordance with item D, within five days of receipt of the objection the RGU shall consult with the objecting agency about the issues raised in the objection and shall advise the EQB staff of its proposed response to the objection. At the request of the RGU, the objecting agency, the EQB staff, and any other affected agency shall meet with the RGU as soon as practicable to attempt to resolve the issues raised in the objection.</p>
                  <p>Within 30 days after receipt of the objection the RGU shall submit a written response to the objecting agency and the EQB chair. The response shall address each of the issues raised in the objection. The RGU may address an issue by either revising the environmental analysis document or plan for mitigation, or by refuting the comment.</p>
                  <p>G. Within five days of receipt of the RGU's response to the objection, the objecting agency shall advise the EQB chair of whether it accepts the response and withdraws its objection or continues to object. If the objecting agency continues to object, the EQB chair shall place the matter on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled EQB meeting or of a special meeting.</p>
                  <p>H. If the matter is referred to the EQB under item G, the EQB shall determine whether the environmental analysis document, including the plan for mitigation, is adequate, conditionally adequate, or inadequate. If the EQB finds the document conditionally adequate or inadequate, the EQB shall specify the revisions necessary for adequacy. The EQB shall only find the document inadequate if the EQB determines that it contains inaccurate or incomplete information necessary to the identification and mitigation of potentially significant environmental impacts, that the review of development scenarios is not in compliance with this part, or that the proposed plan for mitigation will be inadequate to prevent the occurrence of potentially significant environmental impacts.</p>
                  <p>If the EQB finds the document adequate or conditionally adequate, the RGU shall adopt the document under item E. If the document is found conditionally adequate by the EQB, the RGU shall first revise the document as directed by the EQB. If the EQB finds the document inadequate, the RGU has 30 days to revise the document and circulate it for review in accordance with items D to H.</p>

                  <p>A. The procedures of this subpart must be followed in addition to those of subpart 5 if a specific project will be reviewed according to this part and the project would otherwise require preparation of an EIS pursuant to part 4410.4400 or will comprise at least 50 percent of the geographic area to be reviewed.</p>
                  <p>B. Prior to final approval of the order for review pursuant to subpart 3, the RGU must conduct a public process to receive comments about the scope of the review. The RGU shall prepare a draft order for review and distribute and provide notice of its availability in the same manner as for an EAW pursuant to part 4410.1500. The draft order for review must include the information specified in subpart 3 and a description of the specific large project or projects to be included in the review comparable to that of a scoping EAW pursuant to part 4410.2100, subpart 2.</p>
                  <p>C. Government units and interested persons shall participate in the public comment process in accordance with part 4410.1600, except that the purpose of the comments is to suggest additional development scenarios and relevant issues to be analyzed in the review. Comments may suggest additional development scenarios that include alternatives to the specific large project or projects proposed to be included in the review, including development at sites outside of the proposed geographic boundary. The comments must provide reasons why a suggested development scenario or alternative to a specific project is potentially environmentally superior to those identified in the RGU's draft order.</p>
                  <p>D. The RGU must consider all timely and substantive comments received when finalizing the order for review. The RGU shall apply the criteria for excluding an alternative from analysis found under part 4410.2300, item G, in determining if a suggested additional scenario or alternative to a specific project should be included or excluded and must explain its reasoning in a written record of decision.</p>
                  <p>E. The RGU shall adopt the final order for review within 15 days of the end of the comment period. A copy of the order and the RGU's record of decision must be sent within ten days of the decision to the EQB and to anyone who submitted timely and substantive comments.</p>

                  <p>To remain valid as a substitute form of review, the environmental analysis document and the plan for mitigation must be revised if any of the circumstances in items A to H apply.</p>
                  <p>A. Five years have passed since the RGU adopted the original environmental analysis document and plan for mitigation or the latest revision. This item does not apply if all development within the area has been given final approval by the RGU.</p>
                  <p>B. A comprehensive plan amendment is proposed that would allow an increase in development over the levels assumed in the environmental analysis document.</p>
                  <p>C. Total development within the area would exceed the maximum levels assumed in the environmental analysis document.</p>
                  <p>D. Development within any subarea delineated in the environmental analysis document would exceed the maximum levels assumed for that subarea in the document.</p>
                  <p>E. A substantial change is proposed in public facilities intended to service development in the area that may result in increased adverse impacts on the environment.</p>
                  <p>F. Development or construction of public facilities will occur on a schedule other than that assumed in the environmental analysis document or plan for mitigation so as to substantially increase the likelihood or magnitude of potential adverse environmental impacts or to substantially postpone the implementation of identified mitigation measures.</p>
                  <p>G. New information demonstrates that important assumptions or background conditions used in the analysis presented in the environmental analysis document are substantially in error and that environmental impacts have consequently been substantially underestimated.</p>
                  <p>H. The RGU determines that other substantial changes have occurred that may affect the potential for, or magnitude of, adverse environmental impacts.</p>
                  <p>The environmental analysis document and plan for mitigation must be revised by preparing, distributing, and reviewing revised documents in accordance with subpart 5, items D to H, except that the documents must be distributed to all persons on the EAW distribution list under part 4410.1500. Persons not entitled to object to the documents under subpart 5, item D, may submit comments to the RGU suggesting changes in the documents.</p>

                  <p>AN ORDINANCE RELATING TO THE PREPARATION AND</p>
                  <p>REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS</p>
                  <p>The (county board) (town board) (city council) (watershed board) of _______________________ ordains:</p>
                  <p>Section 1. Application. This ordinance shall apply to all projects that:</p>
                  <p>A. are consistent with any applicable comprehensive plan; and</p>
                  <p>B. do not require a state permit; and</p>
                  <p>C. the (board) (council) determines that, because of the nature or location of the project, the project may have the potential for significant environmental effects; or</p>
                  <p>D. are listed in a mandatory EAW or EIS category of the state environmental review program, Minnesota Rules, parts 4410.4300 and 4410.4400, one copy of which is on file with the (county auditor) (town clerk) (city clerk) (watershed district board of managers).</p>
                  <p>This ordinance shall not apply to projects which are exempted from environmental review by Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4600 or to projects which the (board) (council) determines are so complex or have potential environmental effects which are so significant that review should be completed under the state environmental review program, Minnesota Rules, parts 4410.0200 to 4410.6500.</p>
                  <p>Section 2. Preparation. Prior to or together with any application for a permit or other form of approval for a project, the proposer of the project shall prepare an analysis of the project's environmental effects, reasonable alternatives to the project and measures for mitigating the adverse environmental effects. The analysis should not exceed 25 pages in length. The (board) (council) shall review the information in the analysis and determine the adequacy of the document. The (board) (council) shall use the standards of the state's environmental review program rules in its determination of adequacy. If the (board) (council) determines the document is inadequate, it shall return the document to the proposer to correct the inadequacies.</p>
                  <p>Section 3. Review. Upon filing the analysis with the (board) (council), the (board) (council) shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the (county) (city) (town) (district) that the analysis is available for review. A copy of the analysis shall be provided to any person upon request. A copy of the analysis shall also be provided to every local governmental unit within which the proposed project would be located and to the EQB. The EQB shall publish notice of the availability of the analysis in the EQB Monitor.</p>
                  <p>Comments on the analysis shall be submitted to the (board) (council) within 30 days following the publication of the notice of availability in the EQB Monitor. The (board) (council) may hold a public meeting to receive comments on the analysis if it determines that a meeting is necessary or useful. The meeting may be combined with any other meeting or hearing for a permit or other approval for the project. Public notice of the meeting to receive comments on the analysis shall be provided at least ten days before the meeting.</p>
                  <p>Section 4. Decision. In issuing any permits or granting any other required approvals for a project subject to review under this ordinance, the (board) (council) shall consider the analysis and the comments received on it. The (board) (council) shall, whenever practicable and consistent with other laws, require that mitigation measures identified in the analysis be incorporated in the project's design and construction.</p>

                <p>A. An RGU may use a series of tiered EISs to fulfill environmental review requirements for an action where decisions on which alternative to select must be made in stages, progressing from the general to the specific. Prior to each decision which would eliminate from further consideration any alternatives under consideration, a tiered EIS must be completed which addresses the issues and alternatives relevant to the decisions to be made in that tier, at a level of detail appropriate to that tier. The level of detail in earlier tiers need not be as great as that in later tiers, provided that it is sufficient to reasonably inform decision makers of the significant environmental, economic, employment, and sociological impacts of the choices made in that tier.</p>
                <p>B. The procedures for preparing tiered EISs shall be the same as those for a regular EIS, as specified in parts 4410.2100 to 4410.3000.</p>

                  <p>If a project listed in items A to F will be built on state-owned land or funded, in whole or part, by grant-in-aid funds administered by the DNR, the DNR is the RGU. For other projects, if a governmental unit is sponsoring the project, in whole or in part, that governmental unit is the RGU. If the project is not sponsored by a unit of government, the RGU is the local governmental unit. For purposes of this subpart, "existing trail" means an established corridor in current legal use.</p>
                  <p>A. Constructing a trail at least 25 miles long on forested or other naturally vegetated land for a recreational use, unless exempted by part 4410.4600, subpart 14, item D.</p>
                  <p>B. Designating at least 25 miles of an existing trail for a new motorized recreational use other than snowmobiling. When designating an existing motorized trail or existing corridor in current legal use by motor vehicles, the designation does not contribute to the 25-mile threshold under this item. When adding a new recreational use or seasonal recreational use to an existing motorized recreational trail, the addition does not contribute to the 25-mile threshold if the treadway width is not expanded as a result of the added use. In applying items A and B, if a proposed trail will contain segments of newly constructed trail and segments that will follow an existing trail but be designated for a new motorized use, an EAW must be prepared if the total length of the newly constructed and newly designated segments is at least 25 miles.</p>
                  <p>C. Paving ten or more miles of an existing unpaved trail, unless exempted by part 4410.4600, subpart 27, item B or F. Paving an unpaved trail means to create a hard surface on the trail with a material impervious to water.</p>
                  <p>D. Constructing an off-highway vehicle recreation area of 80 or more acres, or expanding an off-highway vehicle recreation area by 80 or more acres, on agricultural land or forested or other naturally vegetated land.</p>
                  <p>E. Constructing an off-highway vehicle recreation area of 640 or more acres, or expanding an off-highway vehicle recreation area by 640 or more acres, if the land on which the construction or expansion is carried out is not agricultural, is not forested or otherwise naturally vegetated, or has been significantly disturbed by past human activities such as mineral mining.</p>
                  <p>F. Some recreation areas for off-highway vehicles may be constructed partially on agricultural naturally vegetated land and partially on land that is not agricultural, is not forested or otherwise naturally vegetated, or has been significantly disturbed by past human activities. In that case, an EAW must be prepared if the sum of the quotients obtained by dividing the number of acres of agricultural or naturally vegetated land by 80 and the number of acres of land that is not agricultural, is not forested or otherwise naturally vegetated, or has been significantly disturbed by past human activities by 640, equals or exceeds one.</p>

If the project meets or exceeds the thresholds specified in any other subparts as well as those in item A or B, the RGU must be determined as provided in part 4410.0500, subpart 1.</p>
                  <p>D. This subpart does not apply to projects for which there is a single mandatory category specified in subparts 2 to 10, 12, 13, 17, or 22, or part 4410.4300, subparts 2 to 13, 16, 17, 20, 23, 25, 29, or 34, regardless of whether the project in question meets or exceeds any threshold specified in those subparts. In those cases, the need for an EIS or an EAW must be determined by comparison of the project to the threshold specified in the applicable subpart, and the RGU must be the governmental unit assigned by that subpart.</p>

                  <p>An EIS is required for residential development if the total number of units that the proposer may ultimately develop on all contiguous land owned by the proposer or for which the proposer has an option to purchase, except land identified by an applicable comprehensive plan, ordinance, resolution, or agreement of a local governmental unit for a future use other than residential development, equals or exceeds a threshold of this subpart. In counting the total number of ultimate units, the RGU shall include the number of units in any plans of the proposer; for land for which the proposer has not yet prepared plans, the RGU shall use as the number of units the product of the number of acres multiplied by the maximum number of units per acre allowable under the applicable zoning ordinance, or if the maximum number of units allowable per acre is not specified in an applicable zoning ordinance, by the overall average number of units per acre indicated in the plans of the proposer for those lands for which plans exist. If the total project requires review but future phases are uncertain, the RGU may review the ultimate project sequentially in accordance with part 4410.2000, subpart 4.</p>
                  <p>The RGU may review an initial stage of the project, that may not exceed ten percent of the applicable EIS threshold, by means of the procedures of parts 4410.1200 to 4410.1700 instead of the procedures of parts 4410.2000 to 4410.2800. If the RGU determines that this stage requires preparation of an EIS under part 4410.1700, it may be reviewed through a separate EIS or through an EIS that also covers later stages of the project.</p>
                  <p>If a project consists of mixed unattached and attached units, an EIS must be prepared if the sum of the quotient obtained by dividing the number of unattached units by the applicable unattached unit threshold, plus the quotient obtained by dividing the number of attached units by the applicable attached unit threshold, equals or exceeds one.</p>
                  <p>The local governmental unit is the RGU for construction of a permanent or potentially permanent residential development of:</p>

                  <p>B. 400 unattached units or 600 attached units in a city that does not meet the conditions of item D;</p>
                  <p>C. 400 unattached units or 600 attached units in a city meeting the conditions of item D if the project is not consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan; or</p>
                  <p>D. 1,000 unattached units or 1,500 attached units in a city within the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area that has adopted a comprehensive plan under Minnesota Statutes, section 473.859, or in a city not located within the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area that has filed with the EQB chair a certification that it has adopted a comprehensive plan containing the following elements:</p>
                  <p>(1) a land use plan designating the existing and proposed location, intensity, and extent of use of land and water for residential, industrial, agricultural, and other public and private purposes;</p>
                  <p>(2) a transportation plan describing, designating, and scheduling the location, extent, function, and capacity of existing and proposed local public and private transportation facilities and services;</p>
                  <p>(3) a sewage collection system policy plan describing, designating, and scheduling the areas to be served by the public system, the existing and planned capacities of the public system, and the standards and conditions under which the installation of private sewage treatment systems will be permitted;</p>

                  <p>A. The local governmental unit is the RGU for construction of a permanent or potentially permanent residential development located wholly or partially in shoreland outside the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area of a type listed in items B to D. For purposes of this subpart, "riparian unit" means a unit in a development that abuts a public water or, in the case of a development where units are not allowed to abut the public water, is located in the first tier of the development as provided under part 6120.3800, subpart 4, item A. If a project is located partially in a sensitive shoreland area and partially in nonsensitive shoreland areas, an EIS must be prepared if the sum of the quotient obtained by dividing the number of units in the sensitive shoreland area by the applicable sensitive shoreland area threshold, plus the quotient obtained by dividing the number of units in nonsensitive shoreland areas by the applicable nonsensitive shoreland area threshold, equals or exceeds one. If a project is located partially in shoreland and partially not in shoreland, an EIS must be prepared if the sum of the quotients obtained by dividing the number of units in each type of area by the applicable threshold for each area equals or exceeds one.</p>
                  <p>B. A development containing 50 or more unattached or attached units for a sensitive shoreland area or 100 or more unattached or attached units for a nonsensitive shoreland area, if any of the following conditions is present:</p>
                  <p>(1) less than 50 percent of the area in shoreland is common open space;</p>
                  <p>(2) the number of riparian units exceeds by at least 15 percent the number of riparian lots that would be allowable calculated according to the applicable lot area and width standards for riparian unsewered single lots under part 6120.3300, subparts 2a and 2b; or</p>
                  <p>(3) any portion of the project is in an unincorporated area.</p>
                  <p>C. A development of 100 or more unattached or attached units for a sensitive shoreland area or 200 or more unattached or attached units for a nonsensitive shoreland area, if none of the conditions listed in item B is present.</p>
                  <p>D. A development creating 20 or more unattached or attached units for a sensitive shoreland area or 40 or more unattached or attached units for a nonsensitive shoreland area by the conversion of a resort, motel, hotel, recreational vehicle park, or campground, if either of the following conditions is present:</p>
                  <p>(1) the number of nonriparian units in shoreland exceeds by at least 15 percent the number of lots that would be allowable on the parcel calculated according to the applicable lot area and width standards for nonriparian unsewered single lots under part 6120.3300, subparts 2a and 2b; or</p>
                  <p>(2) the number of riparian units exceeds by at least 15 percent the number of riparian lots that would be allowable calculated according to the applicable lot area and width standards for riparian unsewered single lots under part 6120.3300, subparts 2a and 2b.</p>
                  <p>E. An EIS is required for residential development if the total number of units that the proposer may ultimately develop on all contiguous land owned by the proposer or for which the proposer has an option to purchase, except land identified by an applicable comprehensive plan, ordinance, resolution, or agreement of a local governmental unit for a future use other than residential development, equals or exceeds a threshold of this subpart. In counting the total number of ultimate units, the RGU shall include the number of units in any plans of the proposer. For land for which the proposer has not yet prepared plans, the RGU shall use as the number of units the number of acres multiplied by the maximum number of units per acre allowable under the applicable zoning ordinance or, if the maximum number of units allowable per acre is not specified in an applicable zoning ordinance, by the overall average number of units per acre indicated in the plans of the proposer for those lands for which plans exist.</p>

                <p>A. The permittee shall ensure that it clears the right-of-way only to the extent necessary to assure safe drilling operations and to provide suitable access for construction and operation.</p>
                <p>B. Equipment used in right-of-way preparation and maintenance shall comply with the noise control rules of the Pollution Control Agency published in chapter 7030.</p>
                <p>C. Where the right-of-way as planned contacts surface water and roads, clearing by the permittee shall be done so that a screen of the maximum possible width of any existing natural vegetation is left along the right-of-way adjacent to the surface water or road. If the natural vegetation that existed prior to clearing cannot be left as a screen and suitable natural regeneration is not likely to occur within one full growing season following right-of-way restoration, native types of shrubs and trees shall be planted by the permittee to provide an adequate screen. Where the right-of-way as planned contacts surface water of any size and type, the permittee shall act in accordance with federal law, including Executive Order 11990, that protects wetlands of all sizes and types, in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, section 84.083, and chapters 103A, 103B, and 103E to 103G, which cover shoreland management, floodplain management, wild and scenic rivers, and permits required for protected waters, and in accordance with any other federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances. The amount and species of vegetation that will be planted to replace the vegetation removed from any Minnesota highway right-of-way shall be specified by the Minnesota Department of Transportation or appropriate county or local authority.</p>
                <p>D. Investigative activities by the permittee in the vicinity of streams shall comply with Minnesota Statutes, chapter 103G, permit requirements of the Department of Natural Resources so as to minimize damage to the natural condition of the area.</p>
                <p>E. Stream banks disturbed during right-of-way clearance or investigative activities shall be stabilized, reclaimed, and revegetated by the permittee using native plant species indigenous to the area.</p>
                <p>F. Areas where natural vegetation has been removed and suitable natural regeneration is not likely to occur within one full growing season, shall be revegetated by the permittee using native plant species indigenous to the area within one full growing season after temporary abandonment.</p>
                <p>G. Where significant grading or excavation or both is required, precautions shall be taken by the permittee to protect and segregate top soil.</p>
                <p>H. Compaction of cropland by the permittee shall be kept to a minimum and confined to as small an area as practicable.</p>
                <p>I. Precautions to protect livestock and crops shall be taken by the permittee.</p>
                <p>J. All appropriate precautions to protect against pollution of the environment shall be taken by the permittee.</p>
                <p>K. The permittee shall repair or replace all drainage tiles broken or damaged during right-of-way preparation or investigative activities unless otherwise negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate, on whose property the tiles are located.</p>
                <p>L. The permittee is responsible for the repair of private roads and lanes damaged when moving equipment or when obtaining access to the right-of-way and for the reimbursement to the landowner or tenant, as appropriate, for crop loss resulting from access to right-of-way damaged during preparation or drilling operations.</p>
                <p>M. The permittee shall replace or repair all fences and gates removed or damaged during right-of-way preparation and investigative activities unless otherwise negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate.</p>
                <p>N. Shelterbelts and trees shall be protected by the permittee whenever possible. If shelterbelts and trees must be cut, native shrubs and trees shall be planted to provide protection in accordance with the request of the landowner or tenant, as appropriate, unless otherwise negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate.</p>
                <p>O. The permittee shall restore cropland to substantially its original condition, unless otherwise negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate. Restoration shall include grading, topsoil replacement, subsoiling and disking, or other methods as negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate.</p>
                <p>P. The permittee shall return pasture to its former level of productivity, unless otherwise negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate. Pasture restoration shall include planting native or tame grasses or other restoration methods as negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate.</p>
                <p>Q. The permittee shall, unless negotiated with the landowner or tenant, as appropriate, restore other areas to substantially their original condition.</p>

                  <p>A. Within the ten working days the chair shall decide whether the proposed amendments require board approval and notify the permittee as to the status of the proposed permit amendments.</p>
                  <p>B. If, in the opinion of the chair, the proposed amendments would not significantly change the terms and conditions set forth in the drilling permit, or materially and adversely affect the environment, the amendments may be approved by the chair.</p>
                  <p>C. If, in the opinion of the chair, the proposed amendments would cause significant changes in the terms and conditions of the permit, or materially and adversely affect the environment, the chair shall submit the proposed amendments to the board at its next scheduled meeting following the chair's determination, providing the determination is made 20 days in advance of the next scheduled board meeting. The board shall approve the proposed amendments if the application as amended complies with all the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 116C.724, and parts 4410.7900 to 4410.7934. The board shall reject the proposed amendments if it determines that the application as amended would not comply with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 116C.724, and parts 4410.7900 to 4410.7934. Proposed amendments submitted to the board shall not be implemented until the board approves them.</p>

                  <p>(2) the history of any previous environmental uses of the genetically engineered organism;</p>

                  <p>(a) whether the recipient organism is native or nonnative to the release area;</p>
                  <p>(b) whether the genetically engineered organism is pathogenic or toxic to target or nontarget organisms and to what extent this trait has been introduced or altered as a result of the genetic engineering;</p>
                  <p>(c) the extent to which the genetically engineered organism's competitiveness and survivability under environmental stress including, but not limited to, dormancy, temperature tolerance, fire resistance, drought resistance, or ability to disperse in the environment have been changed or potentially changed as a result of the genetic engineering. The determination of potential changes must be based minimally on the natural history of the recipient organism and the potential effects of natural selection on the genetically engineered organism;</p>
                  <p>(d) the extent of change or potential change to the recipient organism's resource base including, but not limited to, the ability of plants to grow on new soil types, of bacteria to metabolize new nutrients, and of fish to eat new foods;</p>
                  <p>(e) the potential for the genetically engineered organism's genes to transfer to other hosts and the resultant effects on other hosts' competitiveness, dispersal, dormancy, pathogenicity or toxicity, and expansion of their resource bases; and</p>
                  <p>(f) the potential of the genetically engineered organism to enter or adversely affect the groundwater environment or to pass unusual genes to a microorganism resident in the groundwater;</p>
                  <p>(4) the adequacy and appropriateness of proposed measures, if any, for confinement of the genetically engineered organism;</p>
                  <p>(5) any previous risk assessments for the same or similar organisms prepared by federal or state agencies and their adequacy and relevance to the current proposal including, but not limited to, consideration of the following:</p>
                  <p>(a) the range of soils, ecological biotypes, and meteorological conditions that existed in previous field releases and their relationship to the proposed release area;</p>
                  <p>(b) whether the genetically engineered organisms failed to demonstrate an ability to be self-reproducing or competitive because of transient factors; and</p>
                  <p>(c) whether the scale of the assessment was adequate to assess potential for establishing a self-reproducing population;</p>

                  <p>The purpose of these rules is to provide public agencies and private persons with policy, definitions, procedures, criteria, standards, and guidelines of statewide application to be used in the implementation of the Critical Areas Act.</p>
                  <p>Because development in areas of the state that possess important historic, cultural, or aesthetic values or natural systems that perform functions of greater than local significance may result in irreversible damage to these resources, decrease their value and utility for public purposes, or unreasonably endanger life and property, the state shall identify these critical areas and assist and cooperate with local units of government in the preparation of plans and rules for the wise use of these areas.</p>
                  <p>The critical areas planning process is intended to be neither a "court of last resort" to review purely local planning and zoning issues nor a substitute for an ongoing land planning process involving the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of state and local government. The critical areas planning process shall be limited to exceptional circumstances where other powers are unavailable, inapplicable or are not being used effectively to ensure adequate and coordinated local, regional, and state planning and regulation to protect the public interest in the area.</p>
                  <p>The critical areas planning process is intended to be applied to a limited number of areas in the state. Critical area designation based on criteria that may characterize large or common areas of the state or region shall be avoided.</p>

                  <p>In determining pursuant to subparts 1 and 2 whether a release permit should be issued or denied, modified, or revoked and in specifying or modifying permit conditions, the board must consider the following:</p>
                  <p>A. the familiarity and predictability of the ecologically relevant biological properties of the introduced DNA, the vector if one exists, the recipient, and engineered organisms;</p>
                  <p>B. the history of any previous environmental uses of the genetically engineered organism;</p>
                  <p>C. the potential for the genetically engineered organisms to cause adverse environmental effects including, but not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(1) whether the recipient organism is native or nonnative to the release area;</p>
                  <p>(2) whether the genetically engineered organism is pathogenic or toxic to target or nontarget organisms and to what extent has this trait been introduced or altered as a result of the genetic engineering;</p>
                  <p>(3) the extent to which the genetically engineered organism's competitiveness, survivability under environmental stress including, but not limited to, dormancy, temperature tolerance, fire resistance, and drought resistance, or ability to disperse in the environment has been changed or potentially changed as a result of the genetic engineering. The determination of potential changes must be based minimally on the natural history of the recipient organism and the potential effects of natural selection on the genetically engineered organism;</p>
                  <p>(4) the extent of change or potential change to the recipient organism's resource base including, but not limited to, the ability of plants to grow on new soil types, of bacteria to metabolize new nutrients, and of fish to eat new foods;</p>
                  <p>(5) the potential for the genetically engineered organism's genes to transfer to other hosts and the resultant effects on the other hosts' competitiveness, dispersal, dormancy, pathogenicity or toxicity, or on the expansion of their resource bases; and</p>
                  <p>(6) the potential of the genetically engineered organism to enter or adversely affect the groundwater environment or to pass unusual genes to a microorganism resident in the groundwater;</p>
                  <p>D. the adequacy and appropriateness of proposed measures, if any, for confinement of the genetically engineered organism;</p>
                  <p>E. any previous risk assessment for the release of the same or similar organisms prepared by federal or state agencies and the risk assessment adequacy and relevance to the current proposal including, but not limited to:</p>
                  <p>(1) the range of soils, ecological biotypes, and meteorological conditions that existed in previous field releases and their relationship to the proposed release area;</p>
                  <p>(2) whether the genetically engineered organisms failed to demonstrate an ability to be self-reproducing or competitive because of transient factors; and</p>
                  <p>(3) whether the scale of the release was adequate to assess potential for establishing a self-reproducing population;</p>
                  <p>F. the conclusions reached and conditions imposed by federal agencies with jurisdiction over the proposed release and their adequacy and relevance to the current proposal;</p>
                  <p>G. the conclusions reached or conditions imposed by federal or state agencies on previous environmental releases in Minnesota or elsewhere and their adequacy and relevance to the current proposal;</p>
                  <p>H. the type, extent, and reversibility of environmental effects;</p>
                  <p>I. the cumulative potential effects of related or anticipated future projects; and</p>
                  <p>J. the extent to which the environmental effects are subject to mitigation by ongoing public regulatory authority.</p>

                  <p>A. Any person proposing the use of a genetically engineered organism in a facility that does not meet the requirements of a containment facility, but provides adequate containment for the specific organism, may apply for an exemption from the requirement to obtain a release permit.</p>
                  <p>B. The proposer must file with the board a written request for exemption that includes:</p>
                  <p>(1) a description of the genetically engineered organism and its use;</p>
                  <p>(2) a description and location of the facility;</p>

                  <p>D. The board must grant or deny the exemption at its first regularly scheduled meeting after the request for exemption is filed, provided that the request is filed at least 21 calendar days before that meeting.</p>
                  <p>E. If the board denies an exemption, the board must inform the proposer in writing of its reasons. The proposer may refile a revised request for exemption or may apply for a release permit.</p>
                  <p>F. The use of the genetically engineered organism allowed in an exemption granted under this subpart is exempt from environmental review for a release under chapter 4410.</p>

                  <p>The board may decide a review adverse to a party which defaults. Upon default, the allegations and evidence provided by the nondefaulting party shall be deemed true without further evidence. A default occurs when a party fails to appear at a hearing, fails to comply with any interlocutory orders of the administrative law judge, or fails to timely prefile testimony, and is unable to demonstrate that good cause existed for any failure.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of the prehearing conference is to obtain stipulations regarding foundation for testimony or exhibits, to consider the proposed witnesses for each party, and to consider other matters that may be necessary or advisable to consider. Upon the request of any party or upon the judge's own motion, the administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion, hold a prehearing conference prior to each contested review hearing. The administrative law judge may require the parties to file a prehearing statement prior to the prehearing conference. The statement shall contain items the administrative law judge deems necessary to promote a useful prehearing conference. A prehearing conference shall be an informal proceeding conducted expeditiously by the administrative law judge. Agreements on any matters considered by the prehearing conference may be entered on the record or may be made the subject of an order by the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge shall hold any prehearing conferences in a manner and at a time which will not interfere with the completion of the review process in the time allowed by Minnesota Statutes, section 115A.35 and part 9200.4800.</p>
                  <p>Any application to the administrative law judge for an order shall be by motion, shall state the grounds for the order, and shall set forth the relief or order sought. A written notice of any motion shall be provided to all parties and to the board and shall be served five days prior to the submission of the motion except where impractical. All orders by the administrative law judge, other than those made during the course of the hearing, shall be in writing and shall be served upon all parties of record and the board. In ruling on motions where these procedures are silent, the administrative law judge shall apply the Rules of Civil Procedure for the district courts for the state of Minnesota to the extent that he or she determines that it is appropriate to do so in order to promote a fair and expeditious proceeding.</p>

                  <p>A. Each party shall, within ten days of a demand by another party, disclose the names and addresses of all witnesses that a party intends to call at the hearing. All witnesses unknown at the time of the disclosure shall be disclosed as soon as they become known. Each party shall also disclose any relevant written or recorded statements made by the party or by witnesses on behalf of a party. The demanding party shall be permitted to inspect and reproduce those statements. Any party unreasonably failing upon demand to make the disclosure required by this rule may, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, be foreclosed from presenting any evidence at the hearing through witnesses not disclosed or through witnesses whose statements are not disclosed.</p>
                  <p>B. A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission of relevant facts or opinions, or of the application of law to relevant facts or opinions, including the genuineness of any document. The request must be served at least 15 days prior to the hearing and it shall be answered in writing by the party to whom the request is directed within ten days of receipt of the request. The written answer shall either admit or deny the truth of the matters contained in the request or shall make a specific objection thereto. Failure to make a written answer shall result in the subject matter of the request being deemed admitted.</p>
                  <p>C. Upon the motion of a party, the administrative law judge may order discovery of any other relevant material or information, provided that privileged work product of attorneys, investigators, and similar people shall not be discoverable. The administrative law judge shall also recognize all other privileged information or communications which are recognized at law. Upon proper motion made to the administrative law judge, any means of discovery available pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure for the district courts of the state of Minnesota may be allowed provided that the request can be shown to be needed for the proper presentation of a party's case, can be completed within the time allowed in this rule, and the issues are significant enough to warrant extensive discovery. Upon the failure of a party to reasonably comply with this type of order by the administrative law judge, the administrative law judge may order that the subject matter of the order for discovery or any other relevant facts shall be taken as established for the purposes of the case in accordance with the claim of the party requesting the order, or may refuse to allow the party failing to comply to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or may prohibit the failing party from introducing designated matters in evidence.</p>
                  <p>D. When asked to reveal material which a party considers to be proprietary information or trade secrets, the party shall bring the matter to the attention of the administrative law judge who shall make protective orders which are reasonable and necessary or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
                  <p>E. Discovery shall be conducted in a manner to ensure the completion of the review in the time permitted by Minnesota Statutes, section 115A.35 and part 9200.4800. The hearing shall not be continued to permit additional time for discovery.</p>

A subpoena shall be served in the manner provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure for the district courts of the state of Minnesota unless otherwise provided by law. The cost of service, fees, and expenses of any witnesses subpoenaed shall be paid by the party at whose request the witness appears. The person serving the subpoena shall make proof of service by filing the subpoena with the administrative law judge, together with the affidavit of service. Upon motion made promptly, and in any event at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance with it, the administrative law judge may quash or modify the subpoena on finding that it is unreasonable or oppressive.</p>

The administrative law judge shall utilize the rules of privilege recognized by law. Evidence which is incompetent, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious may be excluded.</p>
                  <p>B. All evidence to be considered in the case shall be offered and made a part of the record in the case. No other factual information or evidence shall be considered in the determination of the case.</p>
                  <p>C. Documentary evidence in the form of copies or excerpts may be received or incorporated by reference in the discretion of the administrative law judge or upon agreement of the parties.</p>
                  <p>D. The administrative law judge or the board may take notice of judicially cognizable facts but shall do so on the record and with the opportunity for any party to contest the facts so noticed.</p>
                  <p>E. A party may call an adverse party, his or her agent or employees, and interrogate by leading questions and contradict and impeach on material matters in all respects as if she or he had been called by the adverse party. The adverse party may be examined by his or her counsel upon the subject matter of the examination in chief under the rules applicable to direct examination, and may be cross-examined, contradicted, and impeached by any other party adversely affected by the testimony.</p>
                  <p>F. Testimony in the hearing shall be limited to issues identified by the board in its statement of issues.</p>

                  <p>E. When all parties and witnesses have been heard, opportunity shall be offered to present final argument in a sequence determined by the administrative law judge.

Neither the petitioner nor the political subdivision shall be deemed to have the burden of proof as to any of the factors. The factors are:</p>
                  <p>A. the risk and effect of the proposed facility on local residents, units of government, and the local public health, safety, and welfare, including such dangers as an accidental release of wastes during transportation to the facility; water, air, and land pollution; and fire or explosion, where appropriate; and the degree to which the risk or effect may be alleviated;</p>
                  <p>B. the consistency of the proposed facility with, and its effect on, existing and planned local land use and development, local laws, ordinances, and permits; and local public facilities and services;</p>
                  <p>C. the adverse effects of the facility on agriculture and natural resources and opportunities to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects by additional stipulations, conditions, and requirements respecting the proposed facility at the proposed site;</p>
                  <p>D. the need for the proposed facility, especially its contribution to abating solid and hazardous waste disposal, the availability of alternative sites, and opportunities to mitigate or eliminate need by additional and alternative waste management strategies or actions of a significantly different nature;</p>
                  <p>E. whether, in the case of solid waste resource recovery facilities, the applicant has considered the feasible and prudent waste processing alternatives for accomplishing the purposes of the proposed project and has compared and evaluated the costs of the alternatives, including capital and operating costs and the effects of the alternatives on the cost to generators; and</p>
                  <p>F. any issue within the established scope of the supplementary review which is not addressed by items A to E.</p>
