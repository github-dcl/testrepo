                  <p>(2) a review of the findings of the executive director's investigation; and</p>

The board's determination shall be based on the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(1) whether the information required in the application has lost substantial probative value due to the passage of time; and</p>
                  <p>(2) whether the delay in processing the application is due to delay by the applicant or the workload of the board.</p>

An applicant with a lapsed license is subject to an administrative penalty of up to $100 to be imposed under part 7506.0170, subpart 5. A lapsed license does not authorize the holder to conduct business as a private investigator or protective agent. The holder of a lapsed license is eligible for reissuance; however, if the lapsed license expires, the applicant must then file an application for a new license.</p>
