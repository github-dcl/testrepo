                  <p>Pursuant to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 13.02, subdivision 8, the responsible authority shall establish procedures to provide access by the parents of a minor data subject to private data concerning that minor, subject to the following:</p>
                  <p>A. The responsible authority may deny parental access to private data when the minor, who is the subject of that data, requests that the responsible authority deny such access. The responsible authority shall provide minors from whom the entity collects private or confidential data with a notification that the minor individual has the right to request that parental access to private data be denied. The responsible authority may require the minor data subject to submit a written request that the data be withheld. The written request shall set forth the reasons for denying parental access and shall be signed by the minor.</p>
                  <p>B. Upon receipt of such a request, the responsible authority shall determine if honoring the request to deny parental access would be in the best interest of the minor data subject. In making the determination, the responsible authority shall be guided by at least the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) whether the minor is of sufficient age and maturity to be able to explain the reasons for and to understand the consequences of the request to deny access;</p>
                  <p>(2) whether the personal situation of the minor is such that denying parental access may protect the minor data subject from physical or emotional harm;</p>
                  <p>(3) whether there is ground for believing that the minor data subject's reasons for precluding parental access are reasonably accurate;</p>
                  <p>(4) whether the data in question is of such a nature that disclosure of it to the parent could lead to physical or emotional harm to the minor data subject; and</p>
                  <p>(5) whether the data concerns medical, dental, or other health services provided pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, sections 144.341 to 144.347. If so, the data may be released only if failure to inform the parent would seriously jeopardize the health of the minor.</p>

                  <p>The responsible authority shall not deny access by parents to data that is considered an "education record," as that term is defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, part 99, section 99.3, unless the minor to whom the data pertains is enrolled as a full-time student in a postsecondary educational institution or the student has attained the age of 18. As of the date of the adoption of these rules, the term "education records" was defined by Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, part 99, section 99.3 as follows:</p>
                  <p>(a) "Education records" means those records which:</p>
                  <p>(1) are directly related to a student; and</p>
                  <p>(2) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution.</p>
                  <p>(b) The term does not include:</p>
                  <p>(1) Records of instructional, supervisory, and administrative personnel and educational personnel ancillary thereto which:</p>
                  <p>(i) are in the sole possession of the maker thereof; and</p>
                  <p>(ii) are not accessible or revealed to any other individual except a substitute. For the purpose of this definition, a "substitute" means an individual who performs on a temporary basis the duties of the individual who made the record, and does not refer to an individual who permanently succeeds the maker of the record in his or her position.</p>
                  <p>(2) Records of a law enforcement unit of an educational agency or institution which are:</p>
                  <p>(i) maintained apart from the records described in paragraph (a) of this definition;</p>
                  <p>(ii) maintained solely for law enforcement purposes; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) not disclosed to individuals other than law enforcement officials of the same jurisdiction; provided that education records maintained by the educational agency or institution are not disclosed to the personnel of the law enforcement unit.</p>
                  <p>(3)(i) Records relating to an individual who is employed by an educational agency or institution which:</p>
                  <p>(A) are made and maintained in the normal course of business;</p>
                  <p>(B) relate exclusively to the individual in that individual's capacity as an employee; and</p>
                  <p>(C) are not available for use for any other purpose.</p>
                  <p>(ii) This paragraph does not apply to records relating to an individual in attendance at the agency or institution who is employed as a result of his or her status as a student.</p>
                  <p>(4) Records relating to an eligible student which are:</p>
                  <p>(i) created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in his or her professional or paraprofessional capacity, or assisting in that capacity;</p>
                  <p>(ii) created, maintained, or used only in connection with the provision of treatment to the student; and</p>
                  <p>(iii) not disclosed to anyone other than individuals providing the treatment; provided that the records can be personally reviewed by a physician or other appropriate professional of the student's choice. For the purpose of this definition, "treatment" does not include remedial educational activities or activities which are part of the program of instruction at the educational agency or institution.</p>
                  <p>(5) Records of an educational agency or institution which contain only information relating to a person after that person was no longer a student at the educational agency or institution. An example would be information collected by an educational agency or institution pertaining to the accomplishments of its alumni.</p>

                  <p>A. Except as otherwise provided in Code of Federal Regulations, title 13, part 121, businesses are affiliates of each other when, either directly or indirectly:</p>
                  <p>(1) one business controls or has the power to control the other; or</p>
                  <p>(2) a third party or parties control or have the power to control both; or</p>
                  <p>(3) an identity of interest between or among parties exists such that affiliation may be found.</p>
                  <p>B. In determining whether affiliation exists, it is necessary to consider all appropriate factors, including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. Affiliates must be considered together in determining whether a business meets small business size criteria and the statutory cap on the participation of businesses in the Minnesota small business procurement program.</p>

                  <p>A. A person shall be debarred if one or more of the following occurs:</p>
                  <p>(1) conviction for commission of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract, or in the performance of the contract or subcontract;</p>
                  <p>(2) conviction under state or federal statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property, or other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that affects responsibility as a state vendor;</p>
                  <p>(3) conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out of the submission of bids or proposals;</p>
                  <p>(4) violation of contract provisions, as set forth in units (a) and (b), of a character that is regarded by the director to be so serious as to justify debarment action:</p>
                  <p>(a) failure without good cause to perform according to the specifications, time limits, or any terms or conditions in the contract; or</p>
                  <p>(b) a record of failure to perform, or of unsatisfactory performance, according to the terms of one or more contracts or as measured by standard commercial practices; provided that this failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance was not caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor; or</p>
                  <p>(5) any other cause the director determines to be serious and compelling including, but not limited to, threatening, abusive, or intimidating behavior; collusion with other vendors to restrain competition; giving false information on a vendor's registration application or response to a solicitation; violating terms of suspension; and all acts that would disqualify the person as a responsible vendor, as defined in part 1230.0150, subpart 20, including debarment by another governmental entity.</p>
                  <p>B. The following must occur in cases in which a vendor is debarred by other governmental entities:</p>
                  <p>(1) Any vendor debarred by the federal government, the state of Minnesota, or any of its departments, commissions, agencies, or political subdivisions, is automatically debarred by the division under the same terms and limits of the original debarment.</p>
                  <p>(2) If the vendor is debarred by any other governmental entities, it is cause for suspension until a determination can be made by the division under normal suspension procedures as to whether the debarment applies under Minnesota statutes and rules.</p>

                  <p>A. Citizens of the United States or lawfully admitted permanent residents who are women, persons with substantial physical disabilities, Native Americans, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, subcontinent Asian Americans, or other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the SBA are deemed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Applicants must submit a signed, notarized certification that each deemed disadvantaged owner is, in fact, socially and economically disadvantaged.</p>
                  <p>B. (1) Each individual owner of a business applying to participate as a socially and economically disadvantaged or economically disadvantaged area small business whose ownership and control are relied upon for certification must certify that the individual has a personal net worth that does not exceed the limit in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, subtitle A, part 26.</p>
                  <p>(2) This certification must be supported with a signed, notarized statement of personal net worth on a form specified by the division, with appropriate supporting documentation. Where necessary to accurately determine an individual's personal net worth, on a case-by-case basis, additional financial information may be required from the owner of an applicant business including, but not limited to, information concerning the assets of the owner's spouse, where needed to clarify whether assets have been transferred to the spouse or when the owner's spouse is involved in the operation of the company.</p>
                  <p>(3) In determining an individual's net worth, the following requirements apply:</p>
                  <p>(a) an individual's ownership interest in the applicant business is excluded;</p>
                  <p>(b) an individual's equity in the individual's primary residence, except any portion of the equity that is attributable to excessive withdrawals from the applicant business, is excluded. The equity is the market value of the residence less any mortgages and home equity loan balances. Home equity loan balances must be included in the equity calculation and not as a separate liability on the individual's personal net worth form. Exclusions for net worth purposes are not exclusions for asset valuation or access to capital and credit purposes;</p>
                  <p>(c) a contingent liability may not be used to reduce an individual's net worth; and</p>
                  <p>(d) with respect to assets held in vested pension plans, individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, or other retirement savings or investment programs in which the assets cannot be distributed to the individual at the present time without significant adverse tax or interest consequences, only the present value of the assets, less the tax and interest penalties that would accrue if the asset were distributed at the present time, is included.</p>
                  <p>(4) Upon certification, an individual's personal net worth and any documents pertaining to it including but not limited to financial statements and federal tax returns must be returned to the individual or destroyed by the division.</p>

                  <p>An individual's presumption of economic disadvantage may be rebutted in two ways.</p>
                  <p>A. If the standard of personal net worth and supporting documentation that an individual submits under subpart 1, item B, shows that the individual's personal net worth exceeds the limit in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, subtitle A, part 26, the individual's determination of economic disadvantage is rebutted.</p>
                  <p>For example, an individual with very high assets and significant liabilities may, in accounting terms, have a personal net worth of less than the limit in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, subtitle A, part 26. However, the person's assets collectively, including high income level, an expensive house, a yacht, and extensive real or personal property holdings, may lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual is not economically disadvantaged. The individual's determination of economic disadvantage may be rebutted under these circumstances, as provided in this subpart, even though the individual's personal net worth is less than the limit in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, subtitle A, part 26.</p>
                  <p>B. If the statement of personal net worth and supporting documentation an individual submits under subpart 1, item B, demonstrates that the individual is able to accumulate substantial wealth, the individual's determination of economic disadvantage is rebutted. Factors that may be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) whether the average adjusted gross income of the owner over the most recent three-year period exceeds the limit in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, subtitle A, part 26;</p>
                  <p>(2) whether the income was unusual and not likely to occur in the future;</p>
                  <p>(3) whether the earnings were offset by losses;</p>
                  <p>(4) whether the income was reinvested in the business or used to pay taxes arising in the normal course of operations by the business;</p>
                  <p>(5) other evidence that income does not indicate a lack of economic disadvantage; and</p>
                  <p>(6) whether the total fair market value of the owner's assets exceeds the limit in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, subtitle A, part 26.</p>

                  <p>B.

                  <p>(1) In the case of a corporation, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or veterans, respectively, must own at least 51 percent of each class of voting stock outstanding and 51 percent of the aggregate of all stock outstanding.</p>
                  <p>(2) In the case of a partnership, 51 percent of each class of partnership interest must be owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or veterans, respectively. The ownership must be reflected in the business partnership agreement.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">3</inline>. <b>Proof of contribution.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. The business's ownership by qualifying individuals, including their contribution of capital or expertise to acquire their ownership interests, must be real, substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the business as reflected in ownership documents. Proof of contribution of capital should be submitted at the time of the application. When the contribution of capital is through a loan, there must be documentation of the value of assets used as collateral for the loan.</p>
                  <p>B. Insufficient contributions include a promise to contribute capital, an unsecured note payable to the business or an owner who is not a qualifying individual, mere participation in a business's activities as an employee, or capitalization not commensurate with the value of the business.</p>
                  <p>C. The qualifying owners must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership, and share in the risks and be entitled to the profits and loss commensurate with their ownership interests, as demonstrated by the substance, not merely the form, of arrangements. Any terms or practices that give a nonqualifying individual or business a priority or superior right to a business's profits, compared to the qualifying owner or owners, are grounds for denial.</p>
                  <p>D. Debt instruments from financial institutions or other organizations that lend funds in the normal course of business do not render a business ineligible, even if the debtor's ownership interest is security for the loan. For example:</p>
                  <p>(1) if an individual pays $100 to acquire a majority interest in a business worth $1,000,000, the individual's contribution to capital would not be viewed as substantial;</p>
                  <p>(2) if a 51 percent qualifying owner and a nonqualifying 49 percent owner contribute $100 and $10,000, respectively, to acquire a business grossing $1,000,000, this may be indicative of a pro forma arrangement that does not meet the requirements of item A; and</p>
                  <p>(3) if a qualifying owner of an applicant business spends $250 to file articles of incorporation and obtains a $100,000 loan, but makes only nominal or sporadic payments to repay the loan, this type of contribution is not of a continuing nature.</p>

Except as provided in this subpart, no securities or assets held in trust, or by any guardian for a minor, are considered as held by a qualifying individual in determining the ownership of a business. However, securities or assets held in trust are regarded as held by a qualifying individual for purposes of determining ownership of the business if:</p>
                  <p>A. the beneficial owner of securities or assets held in trust is a qualifying individual, and the trustee is the same or another such individual; or</p>
                  <p>B. the beneficial owner of a trust is a qualifying individual who, rather than the trustee, exercises effective control over management and policy making or daily operational activities of the business. Assets held in a revocable living trust may be counted only in the situation where the same qualifying individual is the sole grantor, beneficiary, and trustee.</p>

                  <p>A. For purposes of determining ownership, all interests in a business or other assets obtained by the individual as the result of a gift, or transfer without adequate consideration, are not held by a qualifying individual if they were obtained from any nonqualifying individual or nonqualifying business that is:</p>
                  <p>(1) involved in the same business for which the individual is seeking certification, or an affiliate of that business; or</p>
                  <p>(2) engaged in an ongoing business relationship with the business, or an affiliate of the business, for which the individual is seeking certification.</p>
                  <p>B. To overcome this determination and permit the interests or assets to be counted, the qualifying individual must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that:</p>
                  <p>(1) the gift or transfer to the qualifying individual was made for reasons other than obtaining certification; and</p>
                  <p>(2) the qualifying individual actually controls the management, policy, and operations of the business, notwithstanding the continuing participation of a nonqualifying individual who provided the gift or transfer.</p>

                  <p>A. When marital assets, other than the assets of the business in question, held jointly or as community property by both spouses, are used to acquire the ownership interest asserted by one spouse, the ownership interest in the business is deemed to have been acquired by that spouse with the spouse's own individual resources, provided that the other spouse irrevocably renounces and transfers all rights in the ownership interest in the manner sanctioned by the laws of the state in which either spouse or the business is domiciled. A greater portion of joint or community property assets will not be counted toward ownership than state law would recognize as belonging to the qualifying owner or the applicant business.</p>
                  <p>B. A copy of the document legally transferring and renouncing the other spouse's rights in the jointly owned business or community assets used to acquire an ownership interest in the business must be included as part of the business's application for certification.</p>

                  <p>The following factors shall be considered in determining the ownership of a business. A contribution of capital is not regarded as failing to be real and substantial, and a business shall not be found ineligible, solely because:</p>
                  <p>A. a qualifying individual acquired the individual's ownership interest as the result of a gift, or transfer without adequate consideration, other than the types specified in subpart 8;</p>
                  <p>B. there is a provision for the cosignature of a nonqualifying spouse on financing agreements, contracts for the purchase or sale of real personal property, bank signature cards, or other documents; or</p>
                  <p>C. ownership of the business in question or its assets is transferred for adequate consideration from a nonqualifying spouse to a qualifying spouse. In this case, particularly close and careful scrutiny shall be given to the ownership and control of a business to ensure that it is owned and controlled, in substance as well as in form, by a qualifying individual.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>1230.<inline name="num">1605</inline> <b>OPERATING CONTROL.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>A. In determining whether qualifying owners control a business, all the facts in the record will be considered and viewed as a whole.</p>
                <p>B. Only an independent business may be certified as a socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business. An independent business is one in which the viability does not depend on its relationship with another business or businesses.</p>
                <p>(1) In determining whether a potential socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business is an independent business, the relationships with nonqualifying businesses in areas as personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and bonding support, and other resources, shall be scrutinized.</p>
                <p>(2) Present or recent employer-employee relationships between the qualifying owner or owners of the potential socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business and nonqualifying businesses or persons associated with nonqualifying businesses may be considered in determining whether these relationships compromise the independence of the potential socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business.</p>
                <p>(3) The business's relationships with prime contractors shall be examined to determine whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with a prime contractor compromises the independence of the potential socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business.</p>
                <p>(4) In considering factors related to the independence of a potential socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business, the consistency of relationships between the potential socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business and nonqualifying businesses with normal industry practice shall be considered.</p>
                <p>C. A socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of qualifying owners. There must not be any restrictions through corporate charter provisions, bylaw provisions, contracts, or any other formal or informal devices including cumulative voting rights, voting powers attached to different classes of stock, employment contracts, requirements for concurrence by nonqualifying partners, conditions precedent or subsequent, executory agreements, voting trusts, or restrictions on or assignments of voting rights, that prevent qualifying owners, without the cooperation or vote of any nonqualifying individual, from making any business decision of the business. This item does not preclude a spousal cosignature on documents as provided for in part 1230.1604, subpart 10, item B.</p>
                <p>D. The qualifying owners must possess the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the business and to make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on matters of management, policy, and operations.</p>
                <p>(1) A qualifying owner must hold the chief executive officer, president, or highest-ranking officer position in the company.</p>
                <p>(2) In a corporation, qualifying owners must control the board of directors.</p>
                <p>(3) In a partnership, one or more qualifying owners must serve as general partners, with control over all partnership decisions.</p>
                <p>E. Nonqualifying individuals or immediate family members may be involved in a socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business as owners, managers, employees, stockholders, officers, and directors. These individuals must not possess or exercise the power to control the business or be disproportionately responsible for the operation of the business.</p>
                <p>F. The qualifying owners of the business may delegate various areas of management and policy making or daily operations of the business to other participants in the business, regardless of whether these participants are qualifying individuals. These delegations of authority must be revocable, and the qualifying owners must retain the power to hire and fire any person to whom such authority is delegated. The managerial role of the qualifying owners in the business's overall affairs must be such that it can be reasonably concluded that the qualifying owners actually exercise control over the business's operations, management, and policy.</p>
                <p>G. The qualifying owners must have an overall understanding of, and managerial and technical competence and experience directly related to, the type of business in which the business is engaged and the business's operations. The qualifying owners are not required to have experience or expertise in every critical area of the business's operations, or to have greater experience or expertise in a given field than managers or key employees. The qualifying owners must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the business's activities and to use this information to make independent decisions concerning the business's daily operations, management, and policy making. Generally, expertise limited to office management, administration, or bookkeeping functions unrelated to the principal business activities of the business is insufficient to demonstrate control.</p>
                <p>H. If Minnesota or local law requires the owners to have a particular license or other credential in order to own or control a certain type of business, then the qualifying individuals who own and control a potential socially and economically disadvantaged or veteran-owned small business of that type must possess the required license or credential. If Minnesota or local law does not require a license or credential to own or control a business, certification will not be denied solely on the grounds that the owner lacks the license or credential. However, the division may take into account the absence of the license or credential as one factor in determining whether the qualifying owners actually control the business.</p>
                <p>I. (1) Differences in remuneration between the qualifying owners and other participants in the business may be considered in determining whether to certify a business as a socially and economically disadvantaged or veteran-owned small business. Such consideration shall be in the context of the duties of the persons involved, normal industry practices, the business's policy and practice concerning reinvestment of income, and any other explanations from the business for the differences. It may be determined that a business is controlled by its qualifying owner although that owner's remuneration is lower than that of some other participants in the business.</p>
                <p>(2) In a case where a nonqualifying individual formerly controlled the business, and a qualifying individual now controls it, a difference between the remuneration of the former and current controller of the business may be considered as a factor in determining who controls the business, particularly when the nonqualifying individual remains involved with the business and continues to receive greater compensation than the qualifying individual.</p>
                <p>J. In order to be viewed as controlling a business, a qualifying individual cannot engage in outside employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the business or prevent the individual from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the business to control its activities. Absentee ownership of a business and part-time work in a full-time business are not viewed as constituting control. An individual could be viewed as controlling a part-time business that operates only on evenings and weekends if the individual controls it all the time it is operating.</p>
                <p>K. (1) A qualifying individual may control a business even though one or more of the individual's immediate family members who are nonqualifying individuals participate in the business as a manager, employee, or owner, or in another capacity. Except as otherwise provided in this item, a judgment about the control the qualifying owner must exercise in relation to other persons involved in the business must be made without regard as to whether or not the other persons are immediate family members.</p>
                <p>(2) If the qualifying owners, as distinct from the family as a whole, cannot be determined to control the business, then the qualifying owners have failed to establish their burden of proof concerning control, even though they may participate significantly in the business's activities.</p>
                <p>L. When a nonqualifying individual who may or may not be an immediate family member transfers ownership and control of a business to a qualifying individual, and the nonqualifying individual remains involved with the business in any capacity, there is a rebuttable presumption of control by the nonqualifying individual unless the qualifying individual now owning the business demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that:</p>
                <p>(1) the transfer of ownership and control of the business to the qualifying individual was made for reasons other than obtaining certification as a socially and economically disadvantaged or veteran-owned small business; and</p>
                <p>(2) the qualifying individual actually controls the management, policy, and operations of the business, notwithstanding the continuing participation of a nonqualifying individual who formerly owned and controlled the business.</p>
                <p>M. In determining whether a business is controlled by qualifying owners, whether the business owns equipment necessary to perform its work will be considered. Where leasing equipment is a normal industry practice and the lease does not involve a relationship with a prime contractor or other party that compromises the independence of the business, the business may be determined to be controlled by qualifying individuals.</p>
                <p>N. A business shall be granted certifications only for specific types of work in which qualifying owners have the ability to control the business. To become certified in an additional type of work, the business must demonstrate that its qualifying owners are able to control the business with respect to that type of work. The qualifying owner's control of the business in the additional type of work must be verified.</p>
                <p>(1) The types of work a business can perform, whether on initial certification or when a new type of work is added, must be described in terms of the most specific available NAICS code for that type of work. Multiple NAICS codes may be assigned where appropriate. The plain meaning of NAICS code descriptions will be used in determining the scope of a business's certification.</p>
                <p>(2) Businesses must carefully check to make sure that the NAICS codes cited in a certification are kept up to date and accurately reflect work that the business's owners can control. The business bears the burden of providing detailed company information to make an appropriate NAICS code designation.</p>
                <p>(3) If a business believes that there is not a NAICS code that fully or clearly describes the types of work in which it is seeking to be certified, the business may request that the division, in the business's certification documentation, supplement the assigned NAICS codes with a clear, specific, and detailed narrative description of the type of work in which the business is certified.</p>
                <p>O. A business operating under a franchise or license agreement may be certified if it meets the standards in this part and the franchiser or licenser is not affiliated with the franchisee or licensee. In determining whether affiliation exists, restraints relating to standardized quality, advertising, accounting format, and other provisions imposed on the franchisee or licensee by the franchise agreement or license should not be considered, provided that the franchisee or licensee has the right to profit from its efforts and bears the risk of loss commensurate with ownership. Alternatively, even though a franchisee or licensee may not be controlled by virtue of such provisions in the franchise agreement or license, affiliation could arise through other means, such as common management or excessive restrictions on the sale or transfer of the franchise interest or license.</p>
                <p>P. In order for a partnership to be controlled by qualifying individuals, any nonqualifying partners must not have the power without the specific written concurrence of the qualifying partner or partners to contractually bind the partnership or subject the partnership to contract or tort liability.</p>
                <p>Q. The qualifying individuals controlling a business may use an employee leasing company. The use of such a company does not preclude the qualifying individuals from controlling their businesses if they continue to maintain an employer-employee relationship with the leased employees. This includes being responsible for hiring, firing, training, assigning, and otherwise controlling the on-the-job activities of the employees, as well as ultimate responsibility for wage and tax obligations related to the employees.</p>

                <p>A. (1) The eligibility of a business must be evaluated on the basis of present circumstances. A business must not be denied certification based solely on historical information indicating a lack of ownership or control of the business by qualifying individuals in the past if the business currently meets the ownership and control standards of parts 1230.1601 to 1230.1607.</p>
                <p>(2) A business must not be denied certification solely on the basis that it is a newly formed business that has not completed projects or contracts at the time of its application, has not yet realized profits from activities, or has not demonstrated a potential for success. If the business meets the requirements in parts 1230.1601 to 1230.1607, the business is eligible for certification.</p>
                <p>B. Certified socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small businesses and businesses seeking certification as socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small businesses shall cooperate fully with requests for information relevant to the certification process. Failure or refusal to provide such information is grounds for removal or denial of certification.</p>
                <p>C. Except in the case of rehabilitation facilities and extended employment providers, only businesses organized for profit may be eligible.</p>
                <p>D. An eligible socially and economically disadvantaged or veteran-owned small business must be owned by individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged or by veterans, respectively. Except as provided in this item, a business that is not owned by such individuals, but instead is owned by another business, including a socially and economically disadvantaged or veteran-owned small business, is not an eligible socially and economically disadvantaged or veteran-owned small business.</p>
                <p>(1) If qualifying individuals own and control a business through a parent or holding company, established for tax, capitalization, or other purposes consistent with industry practice, and the parent or holding company in turn owns and controls an operating subsidiary, the subsidiary may be certified if it otherwise meets all the requirements in parts 1230.1601 to 1230.1607. In this situation, the individual owners and controllers of the parent or holding company are deemed to control the subsidiary through the parent or holding company.</p>
                <p>(2) A subsidiary may be certified only if there is cumulatively 51 percent ownership of the subsidiary by qualifying individuals. For example:</p>
                <p>(a) if qualifying individuals own 100 percent of a holding company, which has a wholly owned subsidiary, the subsidiary may be certified if it meets all other requirements;</p>
                <p>(b) if qualifying individuals own 100 percent of a holding company that owns 51 percent of a subsidiary, the subsidiary may be certified if all other requirements are met;</p>
                <p>(c) if qualifying individuals own 80 percent of a holding company that owns 70 percent of a subsidiary, so that the cumulative ownership of the subsidiary by qualifying individuals is 56 percent (80 percent of the 70 percent), which is more than 51 percent, then the subsidiary may be certified if all other requirements are met;</p>
                <p>(d) if unit (b) or (c) applies, but someone other than the qualifying owners of the parent or holding company controls the subsidiary, even though the subsidiary is owned by qualifying individuals through the holding or parent company, it cannot be certified because it fails to meet control requirements;</p>
                <p>(e) if qualifying individuals own 60 percent of the holding company, that in turn owns 51 percent of a subsidiary, so that the cumulative ownership of the subsidiary by qualifying individuals is about 31 percent, which is less than 51 percent, then the subsidiary cannot be certified; or</p>
                <p>(f) if the holding company, in addition to the subsidiary seeking certification, owns several other companies and the combined gross receipts of the holding companies and its subsidiaries are greater than the size standard for the subsidiary seeking certification, then under the rules concerning affiliation, the subsidiary fails to meet the size standard and cannot be certified.</p>
                <p>E. Recognition of a business as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a business is an independent business, owned and controlled by qualifying individuals.</p>
                <p>F. Socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small businesses may not be required to be prequalified as a condition for certification.</p>
                <p>G. A business that is owned by an Indian tribe rather than by Native Americans as individuals may be eligible for certification. Such a business must be controlled by qualifying individuals, as provided in parts 1230.1601 to 1230.1607.</p>

                <p>A. An individual business that is not a targeted group business but is owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged person, as defined in part 1230.0150, subpart 24, may be included as a targeted group business if the division determines that inclusion is necessary to remedy discrimination against the owner based on race, gender, or disability in attempting to operate a business that would provide goods or services to public agencies. The business must demonstrate that it is encountering the effects of discrimination as evidenced by the owner lacking adequate external support necessary to operate a competitive business enterprise through a diminished ability to secure:</p>

                <p>(2) equipment, raw material, or supplier trade credit;</p>

                <p>(g) all senior debt, including bonds, debentures, bank debt, mortgages, deferred portions of long-term debt, and capital lease obligations;</p>

A schedule of leased assets with a brief description of type and dollar value must be submitted. A brief outline describing shareholders equity must be submitted, when applicable, for the type of company organization.</p>
                <p>In addition, supportive documentation must be submitted when seeking certification under various provisions as follows:</p>

                <p>(3) A signed, notorized notification must be provided within 30 days of the occurrence of the change. If the applicant fails to make timely notification of such a change, the applicant will be deemed to have failed to cooperate.</p>

                  <p>B. the applicant has failed to provide all relevant required information;</p>
                  <p>C. the applicant failed to establish that majority ownership and day-to-day operating control are held by qualifying individuals;</p>

                  <p>H. ownership of the applicant's business is shared with a previously certified participant who was removed from the vendor list or directory of certified businesses by operation of Minnesota Statutes, section 16C.19, paragraph (c), and part 1230.1850; and</p>
                  <p>I. the applicant's financial data profile does not fit within the parameters in subpart 5a, item C, when applying as an individual business under part 1230.1607.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">5a</inline>. <b>Criteria for determinations.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. In addition to the standards in parts 1230.1604 and 1230.1605, the following circumstances will be given special consideration in determining eligibility:</p>
                  <p>(1) newly formed businesses and businesses whose ownership or day-to-day operating control or both ownership and control has changed will be closely scrutinized to determine the reasons for the timing of the formation or of a change in the business;</p>
                  <p>(2) any relationship between a socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business and a nonqualifying business that has an interest, financial or otherwise, in the socially and economically disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small business will be carefully reviewed to determine if the interest conflicts with the ownership and day-to-day operating control requirements.</p>
                  <p>B. The combined gross sales or revenues from businesses operated by the same owners in related fields exceed the highest size standard for the field defined under Minnesota Statutes, section 16C.16, subdivision 2.</p>
                  <p>C. The following standards, along with supporting documentation, must be used in reaching a determination to certify an applicant under part 1230.1607:</p>
                  <p>(1) Financial data for the company seeking certification shall be analyzed using formulas, techniques, processes, and ratios used in the annual statement studies published by Robert Morris and Associates (RMA), Philadelphia. Where RMA data does not reflect or provide adequate comparable data for the applicant's main line of business, the "Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios," published by Dun and Bradstreet Credit Services, or any similar representative reporting service may be used.</p>
                  <p>(2) Certification determination will be made upon careful review of all the evidence submitted. However, to establish eligibility for this review, the financial data applicable to the applicant company shall fall within the following parameters: financial ratios: at any point between the lower quartile and the upper quartile. Upper quartile ratings are indicative of a successful company not in need of the assistance provided through certification. Lower quartile ratings indicate a need for additional assistance before certification. Lower quartile businesses will be referred to the Department of Employment and Economic Development for remedial assistance before becoming eligible for reconsideration for certification.</p>
                  <p>(3) The following ratios and formulas will be used to determine eligibility for certification:</p>
                  <p>(a) lacking adequate external support in obtaining long-term or working capital financing: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)/interest, sales/working capital, quick ratio, fixed/worth, debt/worth;</p>
                  <p>(b) lacking adequate external support in obtaining equipment, raw materials, or supplier trade credit: current ratio, quick ratio;</p>
                  <p>(c) bonding and insurance: none - review of documentation only;</p>
                  <p>(d) the business has not captured a proportionate share of the market for its goods and services, based on the most current annual statement studies published by RMA. The national average revenues appropriate for the applicant business's standard industrial code and asset size will be divided by the national average assets determined similarly and multiplied by the applicant's actual total assets to indicate a proportionate market share. The applicant business's actual revenues will be divided by this proportionate market share to indicate the actual percentage of the proportionate market attained. Any percentage at 75 or less shall qualify for eligibility.</p>
                  <p>(4) If eligible under part 1230.1607, all other documentation shall be reviewed to arrive at a determination to grant or deny certification. The key determinant is "lacking adequate external support ... as evidenced by diminished ability to secure ..." Even though an applicant qualifies as an eligible business on the basis of financial ratios, if the business has been able to secure sufficient loans, bonding, insurance, or credit at the usual industry norms, it is not qualified as there is no evidence showing lack of support. Conversely, the business may show adequate financial ratios but still find itself unable to obtain any, or only partial, amounts of financing, bonding, credit, or insurance needed to remain competitive, or it can only acquire such at unfavorable terms not normal for its industry segment. Upon finding that such circumstances are not a result of internal management deficiencies as indicated by ratios appropriate to these concerns such as the following:</p>
                  <p>(a) percent profit before taxes/tangible net worth;</p>
                  <p>(b) percent profit before taxes/total assets;</p>
                  <p>(c) percent depreciation, depletion, amortization/sales; and</p>
                  <p>(d) percent officers' compensation/sales;</p>
                  <p>the business can be certified as a targeted group business. The same management efficiency review shall apply when determining certification due to an inability to capture a proportionate market share; however, no other documentation will need be considered under this eligibility criterion. Findings that a business suffers from internal management deficiencies will require a denial of certification until remedial assistance has been obtained through referral to the Department of Employment and Economic Development for help from public or private resources. When the appropriate ratio indicators fall within the eligible zone, the business may again apply for certification.</p>
                  <p>The impact of both short- and long-term business cycles for the economy in general and for the particular business segment in specific shall be considered in arriving at certification findings. When appropriate, an average of two to five years of fiscal data for the applicant company shall be used in determining ratio values.</p>
                  <p>D. Businesses seeking certification that operate in distinctly defined commodities, construction services, or product lines must be reviewed for certification under those distinctions. If the company operates in more than one classification, the review must be made under the primary industry segment if 75 percent or more of its net sales or contract revenues are generated by that segment. The business may seek certification for individual product, service, commodity, or construction activities if 25 percent or more of its net sales or contract revenues is generated by a given category. All other financial data required by this application process must be proportionately attributed to the categories for which certification is sought unless it can be conclusively demonstrated that the dollar amounts shown are directly attributable to specific elements. If the company is unable to provide the breakdown of financial data requested by this rule, it shall accept or request certification under the predominant category in its operation.</p>

                <p>(1) The division shall include a statement on the solicitation document informing all vendors that the solicitation is set aside for responses only from certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small businesses.</p>

                  <p>The division may set goals that require prime contractors to subcontract a portion of any contract for construction or professional or technical services to targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small businesses.</p>
                  <p>A. Goals for subcontracting will depend on the type of work involved, location of project, size of project, and the availability of certified, willing, and able targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned small businesses open to subcontracts from the prime contractor.</p>
                  <p>B. Credit toward the goal established for the contract shall be at 100 percent for subcontractors who provide labor, materials, and supplies and at 60 percent for subcontractors who provide supplies and materials only.</p>

                  <p>A. The prime contractor may request a waiver for some or all specialties based on a documented unsuccessful effort to obtain certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractors. The request for waiver must be accompanied by documentation showing the effort and steps taken to secure certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractors.</p>
                  <p>B. A prime contractor may request a waiver for a specific specialty if a certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractor cannot or will not fulfill a subcontract and no suitable alternative subcontractor is available so as to prevent significant project delay.</p>

                  <p>Solicitation documents must state whether or not the incentive rule applies for the project being solicited. If so:</p>
                  <p>A. Prime contractors who exceed the established goal on a given project for use of certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractors by more than three percent may be awarded a financial incentive over and above the awarded project price, the incentive to be determined in the following manner:</p>
                  <p>(1) Contracts qualifying for incentive clauses may be prime contracts at $50,000 or higher in which the goal for subcontractor use has been set at one percent or higher. The maximum goal qualifying for incentives may not exceed 25 percent. Contracts between $2,000 and $50,000 may qualify for incentive clauses if the approved goal percentage applied to the estimated project cost will provide a minimum of $500 in potential subcontracting awards.</p>
                  <p>(2) A monetary incentive over and above the awarded contract price shall be paid to the prime contractor upon documented proof of actual use of certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractors on the project in excess of three percent of the goal set for that project. The monetary incentive in any case shall not exceed six percent of the awarded project price, or $60,000 at the maximum. The form of documented proof shall be specified in the award agreement.</p>
                  <p>(3) The actual amount of incentive to be paid shall be calculated by the following formula:</p>
                  <p>(a) subtract the established goal plus three percent from 25 percent;</p>
                  <p>(b) divide six percent of the project or $60,000, as appropriate, by the number of percentage points in unit (a); and</p>
                  <p>(c) multiply the result of unit (b) by the number of percentage points exceeding goal plus three percent.</p>
                  <p>(4) The provisions of subitems (1), (2), and (3) shall be applicable to all prime contractors and shall also apply to certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned contractors acting as prime contractors if the awarded contract was not gained through preference or set-aside bidding procedures.</p>
                  <p>B. Prime contractors who have been awarded a contract and fail to meet the project goal for certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractor use without approved waiver shall be penalized up to six percent of the total project value, not to exceed $60,000. The penalty to be assessed will be proportionate to the actual underuse of certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractors as compared to the project goal. The contractor involved shall be notified in writing of the proposed penalty and the reasons for the penalty. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice the contractor may request a hearing before the director or the director's designee. The director may uphold, modify, or reject the penalty. The decision of the director may be appealed within 30 calendar days to the commissioner. If there are facts in dispute, the commissioner may refer the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings for a contested case hearing under Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.57 to 14.62, or, if feasible, may affirm or reject the director's decision. Any person receiving an adverse decision from the commissioner may appeal in any appropriate court in this state.</p>
                  <p>C. If required in a solicitation, prime contractors who fail to meet the project goal without waiver for a project to be awarded and are the apparent low responder shall have a penalty of up to six percent, not to exceed $60,000, added to their total price when other prime contractors have submitted responses that meet the specified subcontracting goal. The penalty to be added must be proportionate to the underuse determined in the response as compared to the announced project goal.</p>
                  <p>D. The formula to be utilized in the application of this subpart is: Penalty (to be added to the response) = maximum penalty x (underuse ÷ project goal).</p>
                  <p>E. The division may cancel solicitations and resolicit the project when no responses meet the announced goal and the evidence available to the division indicated sufficient responsible certified targeted group, economically disadvantaged area, or veteran-owned subcontractors are willing and able to do the work.</p>

When the commissioner determines that the business is unable to perform for the reasons stated, the division shall notify the Department of Employment and Economic Development so that the commissioner of employment and economic development can assist the small business in attempting to remedy the causes of the inability to perform. The division shall notify the business of the referral to the Department of Employment and Economic Development and the notice must include a statement that any records of the Department of Employment and Economic Development in assisting the small business may be discoverable in a contested case or judicial procedure. Failure to enter into a contract, to accept an offered award, or to satisfactorily complete a contract for documented reasons beyond its control will not automatically disqualify a business from future participation in the solicitation process.</p>
                  <p>A. The division may, if circumstances permit, delay an award or completion of a contract to allow the commissioner of the Department of Employment and Economic Development to provide assistance or to allow the business to remedy the business's inability to perform. If the division decides that delay is inappropriate because of the nature of the bid or contract, the division may seek other solutions. The decision to proceed shall not be prejudicial to the record of the business in question.</p>
                  <p>B. Failure of the business in question to reasonably cooperate with either the division or the Department of Employment and Economic Development shall be considered a failure to fulfill the terms of a contract and shall be handled according to parts 1230.1000 and 1230.1100. The records of the division shall document the actions taken relative to each case of inability to perform handled under this subpart.</p>

                  <p>A. The title to the property shall be examined by an attorney for the division, whereupon a field title report shall be prepared by the division. The field title report shall be based on information from the owner or a representative of the owner. The purpose and nature of the acquisition shall be explained to the owner at the time of the field title interview. Where there are occupied buildings involved, a relocation study shall be made to ensure that displacees can be relocated without undue hardship.</p>
                  <p>B. A legal description of the property to be acquired shall be written. Where necessary, a written engineering assessment shall be obtained from the state architect's office.</p>
                  <p>C. The property to be acquired shall be appraised. Appraiser(s) shall be selected by the director or the assistant director, and may be state employees or fee appraisers. Where fee appraisers are used, they shall be selected from a list of qualified fee appraisers, which list shall be maintained by the division. The fee to be paid to the appraiser shall be as agreed upon between the appraiser and the director or the assistant director.</p>
                  <p>D. The appraisal(s) shall be reviewed by members of the division staff. Where the appraisal(s) are deemed satisfactory, the appraisal amount which is deemed to represent value (and damages, where applicable) shall be certified by the director or the assistant director.</p>
                  <p>E. Instruments appropriate for the acquisition shall be requested from the Attorney General's Office.</p>
                  <p>F. A direct purchase offer shall be submitted to the property owner. Where possible and practical, the offer shall be submitted in person. A detailed explanation of the state's acquisition policies and of the owner's options shall be made to the owner, especially including, where applicable, a full explanation of relocation benefits available to the owner.</p>
                  <p>G. If the owner accepts the offer, the property shall be purchased. The division shall be responsible for proper execution of instruments, closing of transaction, recording of instruments, payment to owner, relocation assistance to the owner, and removal of buildings, where applicable.</p>
                  <p>H. If the owner rejects the offer, and the legislature has directed by law that acquisition by eminent domain proceedings shall or may be pursued, the division shall institute necessary proceedings to so acquire.</p>
