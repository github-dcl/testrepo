                  <p>"Random number generator" means a device that has an automated method of selecting game symbols or producing game outcomes based on a preset number of chances available for random selection.</p>
                  <p>A. This subpart is only applicable to electronic game systems or devices that utilize a random number generator, which must:</p>
                  <p>(1) be statistically independent;</p>
                  <p>(2) conform to the desired random distribution;</p>
                  <p>(3) pass various recognized statistical tests as identified in item B;</p>
                  <p>(4) allow for each possible permutation of game elements that produces winning or losing game outcomes to be available for random selection at the initiation of each play, unless otherwise denoted by the game; and</p>
                  <p>(5) not make a variable secondary decision that affects the result shown to the player, such as the random number generator choosing an outcome that the game will be a loser.</p>
                  <p>B. The random number generator and random selection process must be impervious to electromagnetic interference, electrostatic interference, radio frequency interference, and other influences from outside the system or device that may affect the game outcome. Recognized statistical tests used to determine whether or not the random values produced by the random number generator pass the desired confidence level of 99 percent include:</p>
                  <p>(1) chi-square test;</p>
                  <p>(2) equi-distribution (frequency) test;</p>

                  <p>(10) order statistic test;</p>
                  <p>(11) run tests (patterns of occurrences should not be recurrent);</p>
                  <p>(12) correlation test;</p>
                  <p>(13) tests on subsequences;</p>
                  <p>(14) Poisson distribution; and</p>
                  <p>(15) other recognized statistical tests determining the desired 99 percent confidence level.</p>
                  <p>C. The random number generator must meet the standards under parts 7863.0270, subpart 1; 7864.0230, subparts 5, 6, 9a, and 10a; and 7864.0235.</p>

                  <p>A. The board must issue a license to a person who:</p>
                  <p>(1) submits the information required in the gambling manager application;</p>
                  <p>(2) pays the fee as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 349.167, subdivision 2; and</p>
                  <p>(3) is eligible to receive a license under subpart 2.</p>
                  <p>B. The board must deny the application if:</p>
                  <p>(1) a person is ineligible under subpart 2;</p>
                  <p>(2) the person failed to submit the information required by subpart 4 and the application remains incomplete for more than 90 days after it was received by the board; and</p>

                  <p>D. If a gambling manager quits, dies, or is unable to perform the duties, the organization, to continue its conduct of lawful gambling, must comply with Minnesota Statutes, section 349.167, subdivision 2, paragraph (d), for an emergency replacement gambling manager or otherwise discontinue its operation until the organization complies with Minnesota Statutes, section 349.167, subdivision 2, paragraph (e).</p>

                  <p>(1) the organization does not or will not have an organization license or licensed gambling manager when the premises permit is issued, or the organization license has lapsed according to Minnesota Statutes, section 349.16, subdivision 3a;</p>
                  <p>(2) the application has been denied by the local unit of government;</p>
                  <p>(3) illegal gambling was conducted at the proposed site within the 90 days immediately preceding the date of the application, and at a time when no licensed organization had a premises permit for the site;</p>
                  <p>(4) another organization's premises permit for the proposed site is under suspension or revocation for illegal gambling under part 7865.0220, subpart 3;</p>
                  <p>(5) a prior premises permit for the proposed site would have been subject to suspension or revocation for illegal gambling under part 7865.0220, subpart 3, and the suspension period or revocation that could have been imposed for that site has not elapsed;</p>
                  <p>(6) the organization has not submitted the information required by subpart 2, and for a leased site the organization has not submitted a lease as required by subpart 3, and the application remains incomplete for more than 90 days after it was received by the board; or</p>
                  <p>(7) the lessor, the lessor's immediate family, any person residing in the same residence as the lessor, or the lessor's agents or employees have required an organization to perform an action that would violate statute or rule, as referenced in the lease agreement.

                  <p>(a) up to one year from the date of the board's final decision on the matter; or</p>
                  <p>(b) up to two years from the date of the board's final decision on the matter for a second such violation, unless a complete change of ownership of the site occurred at the time of the first or second violation. "Complete change of ownership" has the meaning given in part 7865.0210, subpart 3, item C.</p>
                  <p>When the board determines that an application must be denied, the board must promptly give a written notice to the organization. The notice must contain the grounds for the action and reasonable notice of the rights of the organization to request an appeal under part 7865.0260, subpart 2.</p>

                  <p>A. The value of prizes awarded must not exceed the limits in this subpart or Minnesota Statutes, section 349.211. "Value" means the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) fair market value of merchandise prizes, which must not be an amount less than the organization paid for the prize. Merchandise prizes purchased by the organization at a discount and donated prizes must be valued at their fair market value and included in the determination of compliance with this subpart or Minnesota Statutes, section 349.211;</p>

                  <p>(a) a complete description, including the value of the merchandise or services to be redeemed by the certificate;</p>

                  <p>D. An organization must pay for in full or otherwise become the owner, without lien or interest of others, of merchandise prizes before winners of the prizes are determined, except as allowed by Minnesota Statutes, section 349.211, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), or for raffles with gross receipts of $60 or less.</p>
                  <p>E. When an organization awards a prize that will require registration or licensure by a government agency as a condition of ownership, the organization must use a certificate for merchandise. The winner will be responsible for securing the required registrations or licenses and will be required to give proof of eligibility to receive the prize.

                  <p>A. If bingo balls are used, the 75 bingo balls must be available for inspection and inspected by at least one player before a bingo occasion begins to determine that all are present and in operating condition. Each bingo ball may bear no more than one letter and one number. Each bingo ball in the set must be equal in size, weight, shape, balance, and all other characteristics that control their selection, and must be free from any defects. Except for continuation bingo games, each bingo ball must be present in the bingo ball selection device before each bingo game begins.</p>

                  <p>D. An organization must maintain in sound working condition all equipment used in the conduct of a bingo game.</p>

                  <p>G. An organization must not use sets of bingo paper sheets or packets containing identical faces during a single bingo game, except that identical faces may occur on sealed bingo paper sheet faces during a breakopen bingo game. Identical faces may not occur on facsimiles of sealed bingo paper sheet faces used with an electronic bingo device during a breakopen bingo game.</p>
                  <p>H. Sealed paper sheets or facsimiles of sealed paper sheets must be used for any bingo game for which, prior to the selection of the first bingo number, a person could determine whether a particular bingo face is more likely to win the game than another bingo face or more likely to win a higher alternative prize.</p>
                  <p>I. An organization or its employees or agents must not:</p>
                  <p>(1) duplicate or make copies of bingo hard cards or bingo paper;</p>

A Braille hard card must contain the letters and numbers required by part 7861.0210, subpart 3, in a format that can be verified by sight by a person who is not able to read Braille. An organization may disallow the use of a Braille or large print hard card that does not comply with requirements for bingo hard cards or linked bingo paper. For the use of a personal Braille or large print hard card, an organization must charge a person who is visually impaired the same price charged for a bingo hard card or bingo paper sheet face. Large print hard cards may not be used to participate in electronic linked bingo games.</p>

                  <p>B. A player is limited to the use of not more than two electronic bingo devices so long as one is used exclusively for the play of electronic linked bingo.</p>
                  <p>C. The device may be used with a facsimile of a bingo paper sheet. If a facsimile is used, the organization must provide the player with a sales receipt at the point of sale. This item does not apply to electronic bingo devices used to conduct electronic linked bingo.</p>
                  <p>D. Once a bingo game has begun, no additional bingo faces may be sold for that game.</p>
                  <p>E.

                  <p>F. The organization must offer the use of an electronic bingo device for the same price options to all players.</p>
                  <p>G. The organization must record all voids before the start of the second bingo game in a bingo occasion. For a malfunction that occurs after the start of the second bingo game, the organization must record and document the reason for the void and report the voids to the board within three business days.</p>
                  <p>H. Only licensed manufacturers, linked bingo game providers, distributors, or authorized organization employees may perform service or maintenance on an electronic bingo device.</p>
                  <p>I. An organization must not modify the assembly or operational functions of an electronic bingo device or any of its components. If the electronic bingo device has an audio function, the organization may activate the audio function for all players or may limit the use of the audio function to players who are visually impaired.</p>
                  <p>J. If a player has the option of using credits on a device that may be used for both electronic linked bingo and electronic pull-tabs, the device counts as both an electronic pull-tab device and an electronic linked bingo device for the purposes of device count under Minnesota Statutes, sections 349.17, subdivision 9, paragraph (b), and 349.1721, subdivision 4, paragraph (b).</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">6</inline>. <b>Beginning a bingo game.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A bingo game begins with the first letter and number called.</p>
                  <p>A. Before the start of a bingo game, the bingo pattern or bingo game requirement must be described and verbally announced to the players. In games where players fill in the numbers on bingo paper sheet faces or facsimiles used with an electronic bingo device, the numbers must correspond to the appropriate columns on a bingo paper sheet face and the required pattern. Only the numbers 1 to 15 may be placed in the "B" column, 16 to 30 in the "I" column, 31 to 45 in the "N" column, 46 to 60 in the "G" column, and 61 to 75 in the "O" column. A bingo pattern or bingo game requirement may not be completed with fewer than three bingo numbers having been drawn.</p>
                  <p>B. Before the start of a bingo game, the prize amount must be verbally announced to players. For games with alternative prize levels, the factors determining the prize amount must be verbally announced to players before the start of the game.</p>
                  <p>C. All numbers and letters announced must be clearly and audibly called.</p>
                  <p>D. Immediately following the selection of each bingo number:</p>
                  <p>(1) if a bingo ball selection device is used, the caller must display that portion of the bingo ball that shows the letter and the number to the players. After a bingo ball has been drawn, it must not be returned to the receptacle until the game is completed;</p>
                  <p>(2) except for bar bingo, the caller must make sure that the majority of players are able to see the selected letter and number during the game; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the corresponding letter and number on the flashboard, if used, must be lit.</p>
                  <p>E. If a bingo board is used, the caller must do the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) sequentially open one seal on the bingo board, starting with the number 1; and</p>
                  <p>(2) immediately announce the letter and number revealed.</p>
                  <p>No additional windows may be opened after a winning bingo has been called and verified, unless the game is a continuation game.</p>
                  <p>F. For bingo conducted with a bingo board, the caller must make sure that at least two players are able to see the selected letter and number during the game.</p>
                  <p>G. If the bingo caller discovers a wrong number has been called, the caller must:</p>
                  <p>(1) announce that a wrong number has been called;</p>
                  <p>(2) call the correct number; and</p>
                  <p>(3) correct the flashboard, if used, and continue the game.</p>
                  <p>H. The letter and number selected must be called before the next bingo number is selected, except when conducting a bingo game where the selected letter and number do not pertain to the pattern being played.</p>
                  <p>I. In a bingo game with a pattern that does not require all available bingo numbers, the caller must verbally state before the game begins that selected bingo numbers not pertaining to the pattern will not be called.</p>

                  <p>Except for linked bingo games, an organization must close each bingo game with the following procedure.</p>
                  <p>A. The game must be stopped after a player has declared a valid bingo.</p>
                  <p>B. The next bingo ball out of the device for selecting bingo numbers must be removed from the device before shutting the device off, and must be the next bingo ball called if the bingo is not valid.</p>
                  <p>(1) In a continuation bingo game, the next bingo ball out of the device must be held and used as the first bingo ball called for the next game.</p>
                  <p>(2) In a bingo game where a drawn ball does not pertain to the pattern being played, the bingo ball must be removed from the device before shutting the machine off. If the drawn ball pertains to the pattern being played, the bingo ball must be the next bingo ball called if the bingo is not valid.</p>
                  <p>C. Every winning bingo face must be verified by at least one neutral player who is not an immediate family member of the player declaring bingo plus an organization employee must read aloud the numbers in the winning bingo if an electronic verification device is not used.</p>
                  <p>D. After a bingo winner has been determined and verified, the bingo caller must ask the players at least twice if there are any other bingos. If no one answers, the caller must announce that the game is completed.</p>

                  <p>In addition to other requirements contained in this part, a breakopen bingo game must also comply with the following.</p>
                  <p>A. At the start of the breakopen bingo game an organization must announce:</p>

                  <p>(2) the price of original sealed paper, and the price of trade-in sealed paper, if used.</p>
                  <p>B. A breakopen bingo game begins when, in the presence of players, the organization calls and posts, either manually or by use of a flashboard, a predetermined quantity of bingo numbers.</p>
                  <p>C. For each breakopen game held during a bingo occasion, the organization must use a separate set of bingo balls and one of the following:</p>

                  <p>D. If using a bingo board, the board or placard must be in view of players and seals must be opened in numerical order or as indicated on the board or placard.</p>
                  <p>E. Sealed paper or facsimiles of sealed paper may be sold throughout the bingo occasion. However, no sealed paper or facsimiles of sealed paper for the game may be sold after the organization has resumed calling bingo numbers for the breakopen game.</p>
                  <p>F. After the predetermined quantity of bingo numbers has been called and posted and immediately before the selection of the next bingo number, the caller must ask if any player has completed the designated pattern or bingo game requirement.</p>
                  <p>(1) All players who complete the pattern or bingo game requirement within the predetermined quantity of bingo numbers called are considered winners, regardless of the last number called.</p>
                  <p>(2) If a player or players declare bingo based on the predetermined quantity of numbers selected and the bingo is verified, the player or players must be awarded the designated prize and the game ends.</p>
                  <p>(3) If no bingo is declared and verified, the organization must resume calling bingo numbers until one or more players declare bingo, the bingo is verified, and the designated prize or consolation prize is awarded.</p>
                  <p>G. Except for progressive breakopen bingo games, a breakopen bingo game must be played at a bingo occasion until the game is completed.</p>
                  <p>H. An organization may allow players to trade in sealed paper. The organization must account for the trade-in of sealed paper in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>(1) If a trade-in sealed paper is used, the organization must use two sets of sealed paper for each game. One set, known as the "original set," must be a different color than the second set, known as the "trade-in set."</p>
                  <p>(2) All sealed paper in the original set must be sold for the same price. All sealed paper in the trade-in set must be sold for the same price as other sealed paper in the trade-in set.</p>
                  <p>(3) After purchasing sealed paper from the original set, players may continue to purchase sealed paper from the original set. Players may trade in sealed paper from the original set for sealed paper from the trade-in set.</p>
                  <p>I. An electronic bingo device as defined in part 7861.0210, subpart 15c, item A, may be used with facsimiles of sealed bingo paper for a breakopen bingo game.

After a winner has been declared and verified for a linked bingo game conducted with paper bingo sheets, the participating organization at the permitted premises where the win occurred must notify the linked bingo game provider of the winner's name, address, and all information required for federal and Minnesota tax requirements before any payment is issued. If applicable, any participating organization other than the organization at the winning location may continue play of the game at the permitted premises and award a consolation prize.</p>

                  <p>In addition to the information required by part 7861.0260, subpart 2, an organization must post the flare for each deal of paper pull-tabs in play.</p>
                  <p>A. The flare must be attached to the receptacle or pull-tab dispensing device containing the deal of pull-tabs or prominently posted at the point of sale.</p>

                  <p>Paper pull-tab games must be conducted in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>A. A deal of paper pull-tabs may not be placed out for play in the original container in which it was received. When a deal of paper pull-tabs is put into play, all of the paper pull-tabs must be placed out for play at the same time. All of the paper pull-tabs must be randomly removed from the original containers and thoroughly mixed before a deal of paper pull-tabs is offered for sale. Tiered containers may not be used for the sale of paper pull-tabs.</p>
                  <p>B. An organization may not put into play any paper pull-tab or pull-tab flare that has been marked, defaced, altered, or tampered with, or operate a paper pull-tab game in a manner that tends to deceive the public or affects the chances of winning or losing.</p>
                  <p>C. Separate cash banks must be maintained for each deal unless a point of sale system that meets the standards in this part is used or the deal is played through a paper pull-tab dispensing device.</p>
                  <p>D. Each paper pull-tab must be sold for the price on the flare. A paper pull-tab may not be given to a player free of charge or for any other consideration.</p>
                  <p>E. An organization may not award a prize to a player unless the player redeems a winning paper pull-tab. A prize payout must not be made to any player for a lost, marked, defaced, or altered paper pull-tab, or for any winning paper pull-tab that left the permitted premises where the deal is in play.</p>
                  <p>F. The pull-tab seller must immediately deface each winning paper pull-tab when it is redeemed by the player.</p>
                  <p>G. For paper pull-tab event games where a winning ticket is determined by a method other than an instant win the following apply:</p>
                  <p>(1) if more than one method of selecting the winning ticket or tickets is provided on the flare by the manufacturer, the organization must determine the method to be used and record the determination on the flare prior to making the game available for play;</p>
                  <p>(2) the organization must prominently post the flare prior to the sale of any tickets; and</p>
                  <p>(3) a player with a potential winning (hold) ticket is not required to be in attendance to win and must be given a receipt by the seller for notification purposes if the ticket is selected as a winner. If the hold ticket is selected as a winning ticket, the organization must notify the player within two business days of selecting the winning ticket.</p>

                  <p>A. The chance ticket display containing the chance tickets must be prominently visible when the game is in play.</p>
                  <p>B. For multiple chance games, forfeiting a qualifying winning ticket for a chance ticket is not a consideration.</p>
                  <p>C. When a qualifying winning ticket is presented to the pull-tab seller:</p>
                  <p>(1) the player must indicate in ink on the qualifying winning ticket whether the player elects to:</p>
                  <p>(a) forfeit the qualifying winning ticket for a chance ticket; or</p>
                  <p>(b) redeem the prize indicated on the qualifying winning ticket;</p>
                  <p>(2) if the player chooses to forfeit the qualifying winning ticket, the player may choose a chance ticket contained in the chance ticket display adjacent to the game flare. The seller may not choose the chance ticket;</p>
                  <p>(3) the seller must open that section of the chance ticket display surrounding the selected chance ticket and hand the chance ticket to the player; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the seller must staple the forfeited qualifying ticket to the chance ticket, along with a prize receipt if required, and retain in the game's records for 3-1/2 years.</p>
                  <p>D. When the seller is away from the point of sale or the site is closed for business, the chance ticket display must be secured.</p>
                  <p>E. The organization must immediately close a deal when there is compromised security of the multiple chance game, tickets, flare, or chance ticket display.</p>
                  <p>F. Any chance tickets remaining in the chance ticket display at the close of the game must remain sealed in the chance ticket display and be maintained with the game's records for 3-1/2 years.</p>

                  <p>A. A progressive paper pull-tab game may only be played with deals having the same form number from the same family and manufacturer.</p>
                  <p>B. Each deal in a progressive paper pull-tab game must contribute the same amount towards the progressive jackpot. When the progressive jackpot reaches the jackpot amount listed on the flare, no additional contribution may be made to the progressive jackpot.</p>
                  <p>C. The holder of a paper pull-tab ticket that allows the player to be a potential jackpot winner must also complete a contact information form that includes the organization and game information, holder's name, address, telephone number, and the selected progressive jackpot window or windows to be opened or uncovered if the player is the seal prize winner.</p>
                  <p>D. If the seal prize winner is present, the winner must select a progressive jackpot window or windows to be opened or uncovered by the seller. If the winner is not present, the seller opens or uncovers the window or windows the player has selected and recorded on the contact information form.</p>
                  <p>E. If there is no seal prize winner or the progressive jackpot is not won, the next deal may be put in play or the progressive paper pull-tab game may be closed.</p>
                  <p>F. When a progressive jackpot of $100 or more is won, the organization must:</p>

                  <p>B. Each paddleticket card must have a paddleticket card number preprinted on the stub and on each attached paddleticket. Each paddleticket card must have a different paddleticket card number. An organization must not have two paddleticket cards with the same number in its possession.</p>
                  <p>C. An organization must use paddletickets that are attached to a paddleticket card.</p>
                  <p>D. All paddletickets on a paddleticket card must be sold before the paddlewheel is spun. If all the paddletickets on the card cannot be sold, the organization must refund the cost of the paddletickets to the players. The unplayed paddletickets must be returned to and defaced by the organization.</p>
                  <p>E. The mechanical paddlewheel must be spun by the paddlewheel operator and make at least four complete revolutions before stopping. If four complete revolutions are not made, the spin is not valid and the paddlewheel must be spun again. An organization may not have multiple spins of the paddlewheel to award multiple prizes for one paddleticket card.</p>
                  <p>F. The winning number is determined by the position of the pointer when the paddlewheel stops spinning. If the pointer stops on top of a peg, the number preceding the peg is the winning number.</p>
                  <p>G. Prizes may only be awarded to a holder of a winning paddleticket.</p>
                  <p>H. An organization must not transfer paddlewheel games in play to another permitted premises.</p>

                  <p>The following requirements for the balancing, opening, closing, maintenance, and inspection of paddlewheels apply to all paddlewheel games.</p>
                  <p>A. To open a paddlewheel, the paddlewheel operator must inspect each peg and the pointer for uneven wear and replace any worn peg or worn pointer.</p>
                  <p>B. The paddlewheel operator must check the balance of the paddlewheel by:</p>
                  <p>(1) inspecting the back of the paddlewheel for a foreign object that may affect the paddlewheel's balance;</p>
                  <p>(2) positioning the pointer so it does not interfere with the spin of the paddlewheel; and</p>
                  <p>(3) slowly rotating the paddlewheel 45 to 90 degrees at a time in one direction. The paddlewheel operator must determine whether there is any abnormality in the rotation or any reverse rotation after the paddlewheel stops. The wheel must continue to be rotated until the entire wheel has been evaluated by this method in both directions. If the paddlewheel is out of balance, the organization must balance the paddlewheel before conducting paddlewheels.</p>
                  <p>C. To close a paddlewheel, the paddlewheel operator must place a cover over the paddlewheel or otherwise make it inoperable.</p>

                  <p>The following items pertain to the conduct of paddlewheels with a paddlewheel table.</p>
                  <p>A. Before conducting a paddlewheel game with a paddlewheel table, the organization's gambling manager must attend a board-authorized class on the conduct of paddlewheels with a paddlewheel table. Thereafter a replacement gambling manager must attend a board-authorized class on the conduct of paddlewheels with a paddlewheel table within 60 days of the effective date of the new gambling manager's license. If a gambling manager fails to meet board-authorized class requirements, the organization must discontinue the conduct of paddlewheels with a paddlewheel table until the replacement gambling manager has attended the board-authorized class.</p>
                  <p>B. No more than two paddlewheel tables may be at a permitted premises. If there are two paddlewheel tables at a permitted premises, each table and its drop boxes must have a separate and unique paddlewheel table identification number.</p>
                  <p>C. To open a paddlewheel for use, a gambling employee or volunteer must inspect the cavity of the table for any paddleticket, paddlewheel chip, or foreign object that may have fallen through the slots, and must attach a paddlewheel chip tray and lock a paddlewheel drop box to the table.</p>
                  <p>D. For the sale of paddlewheel chips and paddletickets the organization must comply with the following.</p>
                  <p>(1) All paddletickets must be sold on the permitted premises immediately before a spin to be valid for that spin.</p>
                  <p>(2) Each ticket on the paddlecard must be sold for the same price and must be a separate and equal chance to win with all other paddletickets sold for the spin.</p>
                  <p>(3) The player must purchase paddlewheel chips and paddletickets from the paddlewheel operator at the paddlewheel table.</p>
                  <p>(4) A player must purchase paddletickets only with paddlewheel chips, except that paddletickets for the immediate next spin may be purchased directly with cash in an amount equal to the value of the tickets.</p>
                  <p>(5) When a player first purchases paddlewheel chips, the operator must give the player a card containing a unique identification number. The player must return the card to the operator when the player stops playing.</p>
                  <p>(6) Only chips may be used that comply with the standards in subpart 9.</p>
                  <p>E. Upon receiving currency from a player for the purchase of paddlewheel chips or paddletickets, the operator must:</p>
                  <p>(1) spread each bill of currency face down and flat, in sequence of denomination, in the inner table area perpendicular to the chip tray, and momentarily move the operator's hands away from the currency so the currency is within the camera's view;</p>
                  <p>(2) spread the paddlewheel chips or purchased paddletickets out on the playing surface, and momentarily move the operator's hands away from the chips or paddletickets so that the chips or paddletickets are within the camera's view;</p>
                  <p>(3) restack the chips and push them to the player; and</p>
                  <p>(4) place the currency in the drop box after giving the player the chips or paddletickets.</p>
                  <p>F. The placement of bets must comply with the following.</p>
                  <p>(1) Each player must write the player's assigned identification number on the back of the player's paddletickets before placing the tickets in a betting slot on the paddlewheel table.</p>
                  <p>(2) A player must bet all of the player's purchased paddletickets on the immediate next spin. Any purchased but unplayed tickets are not valid, must not be used on any other spin of the paddlewheel, and must be given back to the operator who must treat them as losing tickets.</p>
                  <p>(3) To bet, a player must place the purchased paddleticket in a betting slot on the paddlewheel table. If the player forces the ticket all the way through the slot into the cavity of the table, the paddleticket is not valid and must be treated as a losing ticket.</p>
                  <p>(4) The paddlewheel operator must announce "bets closed" when the paddlewheel operator has determined that:</p>
                  <p>(a) no other player wants to purchase a paddleticket for the immediate next spin;</p>
                  <p>(b) there is no partially sold paddleticket card; and</p>
                  <p>(c) the players have bet all their tickets.</p>
                  <p>After that, a player may not bet a paddleticket, change a bet of a previously placed ticket, touch any ticket, or place the player's hands on top of the paddlewheel table.</p>
                  <p>(5) The paddlewheel operator may assist a player with a disability if the operator first verbally announces to all players at the table that assistance is being given.</p>
                  <p>G. The paddlewheel operator must record each spin in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>(1) The paddlewheel operator must sequentially number each paddlewheel spin for each day of activity beginning with "one" for the first spin of the day, progressing until activity for the day is completed.</p>
                  <p>(2) The spin number must be written with a nonerasable marker in a consistent manner either on:</p>
                  <p>(a) the face of the first paddleticket card stub for which paddletickets have been sold for a particular spin; or</p>
                  <p>(b) the back of the last stub from which tickets have been sold for a particular spin.</p>
                  <p>(3) All spin numbers must be recorded in the same location on the stub.</p>
                  <p>(a) When the sale of tickets for a particular spin continues into a new sealed grouping of paddleticket cards, the sequential spin number must then be written on the face of the first stub of the group from which tickets are continuing to be sold.</p>
                  <p>(b) For each subsequent spin of the same group of paddleticket cards, the spin number must be written in a consistent manner on either the face of the first stub for which paddletickets have been sold or on the back of the last stub from which tickets have been sold.</p>
                  <p>(4) All tickets sold for a spin must have the same prize payout. If more than one group of paddletickets is sold for a spin, the master flare for each group of tickets must be posted. At the end of the spin, the old flare must be removed.</p>
                  <p>(5) The paddlewheel operator must initial each paddleticket card stub with a nonerasable marker.</p>
                  <p>(6) After each spin, the paddlewheel operator must record with a nonerasable marker the winning number or numbers on:</p>
                  <p>(a) the face of the paddleticket card stub with the lowest serial number of the cards related to that spin of the paddlewheel; or</p>
                  <p>(b) the back of the paddleticket card stub with the highest serial number of the cards related to that spin of the paddlewheel.</p>
                  <p>H. When redeeming a winning paddleticket and awarding a prize, the organization must comply with the following.</p>
                  <p>(1) The paddlewheel operator must remove all losing paddletickets from the slots on the paddlewheel table and in view of the players tear in half and discard the torn tickets in a container that is not easily accessible by a player.</p>
                  <p>(2) Next, the operator must pay off the winning tickets, if any, slot by slot. To pay off the winning tickets, the operator must:</p>
                  <p>(a) circle or record, in ink, the winning number or set of numbers on the face or on the back of the winning ticket;</p>
                  <p>(b) pay off the winning ticket in chips to the player who has the card containing the unique identification number written on the back of the ticket; and</p>
                  <p>(c) record the prize amount in ink on the face or on the back of the winning ticket.</p>
                  <p>I. To close a paddlewheel, a paddlewheel operator must tell the players that their paddlewheel chips must be redeemed through the cash bank cashier. A paddlewheel operator must collect all identification cards from the players.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">8</inline>. <b>Operating procedures and internal controls for paddlewheels with a paddlewheel table.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The following operating procedures and internal controls apply to the conduct of paddlewheels with a paddlewheel table.</p>
                  <p>A. An organization is responsible for the safeguarding and secure storage of paddleticket cards and paddlewheel chips.</p>
                  <p>B. An organization must redeem paddlewheel chips for cash at the value for which they were sold. The chips must be redeemed only through the paddlewheel chip and cash bank cashier. The organization must keep the cash bank used to redeem paddlewheel chips separate from all other organization cash. Until the organization completes the records for the time period during which the chips were redeemed, the organization must keep redeemed chips separate and apart from the chip bank.</p>
                  <p>C. All tips must be made only with paddlewheel chips. A paddlewheel operator must redeem paddlewheel chips received as tips through the paddlewheel chip and cash bank cashier and may not exchange those chips for other chips from any chip tray.</p>
                  <p>D. An organization may not transfer or make change of chips directly from one table to another table.</p>
                  <p>E. When paddlewheel chips are distributed to a paddlewheel table from the chip bank, the paddlewheel chip and cash bank cashier must prepare a fill slip. The fill slip must be at least a two-part carbonless form and include at a minimum the following information:</p>
                  <p>(1) date and time;</p>
                  <p>(2) denomination of chips;</p>
                  <p>(3) quantity and total dollar value, by denomination, of chips;</p>
                  <p>(4) total dollar value of chips; and</p>
                  <p>(5) if there is more than one paddlewheel table located at the permitted premises, the table identification number.</p>
                  <p>The cashier must keep the original copy of the fill slip. The paddlewheel operator must deposit the duplicate copy of the fill slip in the paddlewheel table drop box.</p>
                  <p>F. When paddlewheel chips are returned from the paddlewheel table to the chip bank, the paddlewheel operator must prepare a credit slip which must be at least a two-part carbonless form. The same information must be recorded on the original and duplicate credit slip as on a fill slip. The paddlewheel operator must deposit the original copy of the credit slip in the paddlewheel table drop box, and the cashier must keep the duplicate copy of the credit slip.</p>
                  <p>G. After play has started, the paddlewheel operator must keep the money plunger in the paddlewheel table drop box slot while the drop box is attached to the table. The paddlewheel operator must remove the money plunger when coin, currency, or forms are being inserted into the drop box.</p>
                  <p>H. The paddlewheel operator must immediately place all cash received for paddlewheel chips into the drop box. The contents of the drop box may not be accessed by any person before the drop box cash count.</p>
                  <p>I. An organization employee or volunteer, who is not the paddlewheel operator or paddlewheel chip and cash bank cashier, must keep and control the key to at least one lock securing the contents of the paddlewheel drop box during the time a paddlewheel is in play.</p>
                  <p>J. At the end of the activity, the paddlewheel operator must remove and secure the unopened drop box.</p>
                  <p>K. The drop box must be opened and the cash counted by two organization employees or volunteers, only one of which may be the paddlewheel operator or the chip and cash bank cashier.</p>

                  <p>A bet is void if it exceeds one or more of these limits. The paddletickets used to make the excess portion of the bet must be treated as losing tickets.</p>
                  <p>B. The prize payout must be a predetermined variable multiple of the amount wagered, must be made in paddlewheel chips, and must not exceed the following ratios:</p>
                  <p>(1) 40 to 1 for a bet on a single number in the outer concentric circle of the paddlewheel;</p>

An organization must keep records to account for the paddletickets, paddleticket cards, paddlewheel chips, gross receipts, actual net receipts, actual cash profit, and cash long or short for each separate time period on each day that a paddlewheel table is open for play.</p>
                  <p>F. For each separate time period that a paddlewheel table is in use, an organization must keep a record of the following information:</p>

                  <p>(2) all linked bingo game providers and distributors that they may not sell or lease any gambling equipment to the delinquent organization.</p>
                  <p>F. When the board has been notified that the delinquency is paid in full, the board must notify all linked bingo game providers and distributors that the delinquency has been paid and that the sale or lease of gambling equipment to the organization is authorized.</p>
                  <p>G. Until authorized by the board, a linked bingo game provider or distributor may not extend credit or sell or lease gambling equipment to an organization in violation of an order under items D and E.</p>

                  <p>This subpart applies to board approval of electronic gambling equipment, conformance with standards for previously approved electronic gambling equipment, and independent laboratory testing required for certain electronic gambling equipment.</p>
                  <p>A. Before the sale, lease, or distribution of any electronic gambling equipment in Minnesota, a linked bingo game provider must obtain prior board approval for the electronic gambling equipment. The linked bingo game provider must provide to the director at no charge the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) the list of proposed equipment in an electronic format or other format approved by the board;</p>
                  <p>(2) the electronic linked bingo games; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the electronic linked bingo test system and equipment to be used to determine compliance with this part.</p>
                  <p>B. Electronic gambling equipment must be received by the board on or before the 15th day of the month to ensure consideration at the board's meeting the following month.</p>
                  <p>C. The board must notify the linked bingo game provider in writing no later than five days after a board meeting of the board's decision on whether the product is approved for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>D. For changes to the payout structure for any approved game, the linked bingo game provider must assign a new game identification and submit the game for review and approval by the board before being offered for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>E. For changes to approved electronic gambling equipment, the linked bingo game provider must submit the changes to the director for review, and, if required by the director, equipment must be submitted for review and approval by the board.</p>
                  <p>(1) The version of gambling equipment containing changes approved by the director under this item is the only version of gambling equipment allowed to be available for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>(2) Handheld, portable electronic devices with power cords approved before July 15, 2019, may remain in play for 180 days from July 15, 2019, at which time the devices must be permanently removed from play. All other previously approved electronic gambling equipment approved before July 15, 2019, must come into compliance within 180 days of July 15, 2019.</p>
                  <p>F. Within 14 days of receipt of an electronic linked bingo game, the director must notify the linked bingo game provider in writing of the director's decision to recommend approval or recommend denial.</p>
                  <p>(1) The written notice of the director's recommended denial must state the basis for the director's recommendation of denial. Within 14 days of receipt of a notice of the director's recommended denial, the linked bingo game provider may request a contested case hearing under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>(2) The written notice of the board's denial must state the basis for the board's denial.</p>
                  <p>G. Linked bingo game providers are in compliance if the electronic gambling equipment is approved by the board and is produced in compliance with the standards prescribed in this part. Once approved, a linked bingo game provider may not change the equipment without prior approval of the board, in compliance with this subpart and part 7863.0260, subpart 1a. The board shall withdraw its approval if it determines that the electronic gambling equipment:</p>
                  <p>(1) was not manufactured in compliance with standards in this part; or</p>
                  <p>(2) is defective and the defect is not immediately corrected and submitted for reapproval by the board for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>If the board decides that its approval should be withdrawn, the board will notify the linked bingo game provider of its right to request a contested case hearing under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>H. Not later than December 31 of each calendar year, a linked bingo game provider must submit to the board, on a form prescribed by the board, a list of all board-approved games that it intends to sell in Minnesota. Any board-approved game not included on the linked bingo game provider's list, or any board-approved game that has not been played by a licensed organization in Minnesota in the previous two calendar years, will be considered abandoned by the linked bingo game provider and will be removed from the board's approved games database. Nothing in this subpart prohibits a linked bingo game provider from voluntarily informing the board at any time of an abandoned game. A voluntarily abandoned game may not be provided by a linked bingo game provider for play in Minnesota unless the game is reapproved by the director.</p>
                  <p>I. Independent testing requirements for electronic gambling equipment when required by the board shall include a certification from a board-approved testing laboratory that the electronic gambling equipment tested meets the electronic linked bingo standards and requirements as established in Minnesota Statutes and Minnesota Rules and in conformance with game procedures as provided by the linked bingo game provider. The certification must include:</p>
                  <p>(1) a detailed description of the equipment and related software applications that were tested, including applicable model numbers of specific equipment and the software version of the application used for testing;</p>
                  <p>(2) the specific reference to the standard being tested;</p>
                  <p>(3) a statement that the equipment meets the standard; and</p>
                  <p>(4) any additional findings or issues of concern that might affect the performance or play of the equipment.</p>
                  <p>J. Independent testing of electronic gambling equipment includes:</p>
                  <p>(1) electronic linked bingo game devices;</p>
                  <p>(2) programmable electronic devices;</p>
                  <p>(3) electronic linked bingo game systems;</p>
                  <p>(4) upgrades or changes to previously approved and tested equipment;</p>
                  <p>(5) other technical hardware devices used in conjunction with lawful gambling equipment;</p>
                  <p>(6) software applications and version upgrades used in conjunction with lawful gambling equipment;</p>
                  <p>(7) user-acceptance testing, which ensures the different functionalities of the system and software work as they would in real-life scenarios. User-acceptance testing includes accurate game simulation; and</p>
                  <p>(8) quality assurance, including:</p>
                  <p>(a) patterns, game payout indicators, and payouts must match;</p>
                  <p>(b) bingo patterns and conduct are accurate and must match;</p>
                  <p>(c) game must play as stated on the program; and</p>
                  <p>(d) the proposed game version and the version provided by the linked bingo game provider to the board for consideration of approval must be identical.</p>

                  <p>This subpart applies to a manufacturer license issued or denied by the board.</p>
                  <p>A. Before issuing or denying a new or renewal manufacturer license, the board must conduct or request the director of alcohol and gambling enforcement to conduct a background investigation that includes a review of the manufacturer's sources of financing, ownership, and organizational structure. Actual costs in addition to the new or renewal application fee must be paid by the manufacturer.</p>
                  <p>B. The board must issue a new or renewal license to a manufacturer who:</p>
                  <p>(1) submits the information required in the application and attachments, and for a renewal application submits a complete application at least 75 days before the expiration of the existing license;</p>
                  <p>(2) pays the fee required by Minnesota Statutes, section 349.163, subdivision 2; and</p>
                  <p>(3) is eligible to receive a license under item A and subparts 2 and 3.</p>
                  <p>C. The board must deny the application if a manufacturer:</p>
                  <p>(1) is ineligible under subparts 2 and 3; and</p>
                  <p>(2) failed to submit all information required by subparts 4 and 5.</p>
                  <p>When the board determines that an application must be denied, the board must promptly give a written notice to the manufacturer. The notice must contain the grounds for the action and reasonable notice of the rights of the manufacturer to request an appeal under part 7865.0260, subpart 2 or 4, whichever is applicable.</p>
                  <p>D. All fees submitted with a new or renewal license application are considered earned and are not refundable.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subpart <inline name="num">1</inline>. <b>Prior board approval required for paper pull-tab games, tipboard games, promotional paper pull-tab or tipboard tickets, raffle boards, and bingo boards; conformance with standards for previously approved games.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The following pertain to prior board approval required for paper pull-tab games, tipboard games, promotional paper pull-tab tickets, tipboard tickets, raffle boards, and bingo boards manufactured for sale in Minnesota, and conformance with standards for previously approved games.</p>
                  <p>A. To obtain prior board approval for paper pull-tab and tipboard games, promotional paper pull-tab or tipboard tickets, raffle boards, and bingo boards, a manufacturer must submit to the director a deal of tickets; flare; prize pool board and chance ticket display, if any; raffle board; and bingo board that has been produced to comply with the manufacturing standards prescribed in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>B. Within 14 days of receipt of the gambling equipment, the director must notify the manufacturer in writing of the director's decision to recommend approval or recommend denial of the gambling equipment.</p>
                  <p>(1) The written notice of the director's recommended denial must state the basis for the director's recommendation of denial. Within 14 days of receipt of a notice of the director's recommended denial, the manufacturer may request a contested case hearing under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>(2) The written notice of the board's denial must state the basis for the board's denial.</p>
                  <p>C. Manufacturers are in compliance if the gambling equipment is approved by the board, and all tickets, flares, any prize pool boards, chance ticket displays, raffle boards, and bingo boards, are produced in compliance with the manufacturing standards prescribed in this chapter. Once approved, a manufacturer may not change any gambling equipment without prior approval of the board, in compliance with subpart 11.</p>
                  <p>D. Not later than December 31 of each calendar year, a manufacturer must submit to the board, on a form prescribed by the board, a list of all board-approved games that it intends to sell in Minnesota. Any board-approved game not included on the manufacturer's list, or any board-approved game that the manufacturer has not shipped into Minnesota in the previous two calendar years, will be considered abandoned by the manufacturer and will be removed from the board's approved games database. Nothing in this subpart prohibits a manufacturer from voluntarily informing the board at any time of an abandoned game. A voluntarily abandoned game may not be shipped by a manufacturer into Minnesota unless the game is reapproved by the director. Abandoned games shipped into Minnesota by the manufacturer on or before December 31 may continue to be sold in Minnesota by licensed distributors and organizations.</p>
                  <p>E. The board may withdraw its approval if it determines that the paper tickets, including chance tickets and their chance ticket displays, flares, prize pool boards, if any, raffle boards, and bingo boards, were not manufactured in such a manner to be tamper-resistant. If the board decides that its approval should be withdrawn, the board will notify the manufacturer of its right to request a contested case hearing under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>F. For changes to the payout structure or ticket count for any approved game or for any game within a family of games, the manufacturer must assign a new game form number and submit the game for review and approval by the board before being offered for sale in Minnesota. The version of gambling equipment containing changes approved by the director under subpart 11, item A, subitem (5), is the only version of the gambling equipment the manufacturer is allowed to ship into Minnesota for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>G. Previously approved games not in compliance with this part must come into compliance within 180 days of being notified by the board.</p>

                  <p>A. Paper pull-tab, tipboard, and sports-themed tipboard tickets manufactured for sale in Minnesota must, at a minimum, include the following information printed on the front of a ticket and be the same for all tickets in a deal:</p>
                  <p>(1) manufacturer's name or its board-registered logo;</p>
                  <p>(2) game name, which must be identical to the game name on the flare for that deal;</p>
                  <p>(3) game serial number, which must be a minimum of five and a maximum of eight characters, printed on the game information side of the pull-tab, and must not be repeated on gambling equipment of the same form number for 3-1/2 years from the date of the manufacturer's invoice to the distributor. There must not be more than one serial number in a deal;</p>
                  <p>(4) unique form number for that game;</p>
                  <p>(5) the letters XB must be used in front of the unique form number for sports-themed tipboard games and must not be used at the beginning of a unique form number for any other tipboard or pull-tab game;</p>
                  <p>(6) cost per play, not to exceed the limit under Minnesota Statutes, section 349.211, and this subitem does not apply to chance tickets;</p>
                  <p>(7) quantity of winners in each tier, and the respective winning numbers or symbols and prize amount, except chance tickets shall also display the quantity of winners for each tier of winning prizes contained in the game's chance tickets;</p>
                  <p>(8) paper tickets with an unopened, overall area of 1.6 square inches or less are exempt from subitems (4), (6), and (7); and</p>
                  <p>(9) paper tickets with an overall area of less than 2.5 square inches but more than 1.6 square inches are exempt from subitem (7).</p>
                  <p>B. In addition to item A, multiple chance games must:</p>
                  <p>(1) contain a predetermined number of winning and losing tickets;</p>
                  <p>(2) contain a predetermined number of qualifying winning tickets that provide an option to the player to forfeit the ticket for a chance ticket which may contain a prize greater than, equal to, or less than the qualifying winning ticket; and</p>
                  <p>(3) contain a predetermined number of tickets designated as chance tickets.</p>
                  <p>C. In addition to item A, requirements for qualifying winning tickets are as follows:</p>
                  <p>(1) there must be the same number of qualifying winning tickets as there are chance tickets in the game;</p>
                  <p>(2) a qualifying winning ticket in a game where there are seals on the flare must:</p>
                  <p>(a) indicate that the ticket is a qualifying winning ticket; and</p>
                  <p>(b) contain the preprinted seal number to be opened or contain a space for a player to indicate in ink the player's chosen seal number and a space for the player to initial in ink the player's selection; and</p>
                  <p>(3) qualifying winning tickets used with chance ticket displays must contain a space for a player to indicate in ink the player's choice of:</p>
                  <p>(a) forfeiting the qualifying winning ticket for a chance ticket; or</p>
                  <p>(b) redeeming the prize indicated on the qualifying winning ticket.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">1b</inline>. <b>Manufacturing standards for design and manufacture of paper pull-tab and tipboard tickets.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The design and manufacture of paper pull-tab and tipboard tickets must comply with the following.</p>
                  <p>A. Except for folded and banded tickets, symbol blocks must be a minimum of 2.5/32 inch from the die-cut edge of the ticket.</p>
                  <p>B. To be tamper-resistant, tickets must be designed, constructed, glued, and assembled to prevent the determination of a winning or losing ticket before its sale to the public:</p>
                  <p>(1) from the outside of the ticket in any manner;</p>
                  <p>(2) without removing the tabs or opening the tickets to reveal the numbers or symbols;</p>
                  <p>(3) when using a light; or</p>
                  <p>(4) due to any manufacturing or color variations in the tickets.</p>
                  <p>The glue must be of sufficient strength and type to prevent the separation or delamination of the ticket.</p>
                  <p>C. All winning tickets must have a primary and secondary form of identifying a winner. A secondary form of identifying a winner is not required for folded and banded tickets.</p>
                  <p>D. Winning tickets must comply with the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) tickets with both a primary and secondary win indicator must be designed so the win indicators are a minimum of 3.5/32 inch from the die-cut edge of the ticket;</p>
                  <p>(2) if a win bar is used and extends into the column farthest from the hinged side of the ticket, it must be 5/32 inch from the die-cut edge; and</p>
                  <p>(3) if randomly generated alphanumeric win indicators are used, they must be printed in the space between the hinge and the column closest to the hinge, or located in any position except the column farthest from the hinged side. Alphanumeric win indicators must be designed so that the code numbers, or any color used to highlight the code numbers, are a minimum of 3.5/32 inch from the die-cut edge.</p>
                  <p>E. Dimensions must be the same for all tickets in the deal.</p>
                  <p>F. Tickets must not contain coupons or discounts.</p>
                  <p>G. The qualifying tickets for a multiple seal or cumulative game must specify the seal to be opened or uncovered by the seller, or indicate that the player may select the seal to be opened.</p>
                  <p>H. Pull-tab tickets for an event game must be designed in such a way to avoid duplicate winning hold tickets. This item pertains to event games allowed by Minnesota Statutes, section 349.1721, subdivision 2.</p>
                  <p>I. Each deal must have an ideal sales and prize payout structure designed to result in a profit for the game, not to exceed the limit under Minnesota Statutes, section 349.2113.</p>
                  <p>J. Chance tickets must be randomly placed by the manufacturer in a chance ticket display that conforms to the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) each chance ticket is independently sealed in a separate section of the display;</p>
                  <p>(2) the chance ticket display must be constructed of a tamper-resistant material that indicates tampering if the seal, perforation, or other covering is broken; and</p>
                  <p>(3) chance ticket removal requires the breaking of the perforation, seal, or other covering.</p>
                  <p>K. Tickets used in sports-themed tipboard games must contain the statement "Not for resale."</p>

                  <p>The packaging of paper pull-tab and tipboard tickets for each deal must comply with items A to J.</p>
                  <p>A. Winning or qualifying tickets must be distributed and mixed among all other tickets in a deal to eliminate any pattern between deals or portions of deals from which the location or approximate location of any winning or qualifying tickets may be determined. The deal must be assembled so that placement of winning, qualifying, or losing tickets does not allow for the possibility of prize manipulation or selection of winning or qualifying tickets.</p>
                  <p>B. Subsets of a deal are not allowed.</p>
                  <p>C. A cumulative game may not contain more than 10,000 tickets in total for all deals in the game.</p>
                  <p>D. Progressive or cumulative sports-themed tipboards are not allowed.</p>
                  <p>E. Each deal's container must be sealed with a manufacturer's seal that includes a warning to the purchaser that the game may have been tampered with if the container was received by the purchaser with the manufacturer's seal broken.</p>
                  <p>(1) The seal must be of sufficient strength to prevent the seal from breaking when shipped to a purchaser.</p>
                  <p>(2) The seal must be:</p>
                  <p>(a) under the container's shrink-wrap; or</p>
                  <p>(b) if tickets are packaged using a heat-sealed process with plastic with a minimum thickness of 2 mil, the seal must be printed or affixed on the plastic.</p>
                  <p>F. The serial number must be clearly and legibly placed on the outside of the deal's container.</p>
                  <p>G. Except for deals packaged using a heat-sealed process with plastic with a minimum thickness of 2 mil, each pull-tab deal, including the flare and any other required information, must be sealed in shrink-wrap. Each case of individual tipboard games in which the tipboard tickets are affixed to the flare must be sealed in shrink-wrap. Chance ticket displays containing chance tickets must be packaged with the corresponding multiple chance game.</p>
                  <p>H. Chance ticket displays must have the game's name, form number, serial number, and prize tiers clearly printed on the display. A display constructed of transparent material where this information is visible on the chance tickets satisfies this provision.</p>
                  <p>I. The manufacturer must:</p>
                  <p>(1) attach to the outside of the container a bar code that contains information required by the commissioner of revenue according to Minnesota Statutes, section 297E.04, subdivision 2; and</p>
                  <p>(2) include an extra self-adhesive bar code inside each deal.</p>
                  <p>J. Each deal must contain the same number of tickets and winning combinations in the same denomination as listed on the flare.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">2</inline>. <b>Manufacturing standards for paper pull-tab dispensing devices.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Paper pull-tab dispensing devices used to dispense paper pull-tab tickets and manufactured to be sold or leased in Minnesota must have the manufacturer's name or board-registered logo, serial number, model number, and date of manufacture permanently attached to it, and conform to the following standards.</p>
                  <p>A. The electrical, electronic, and programming features of the paper pull-tab dispensing device must:</p>
                  <p>(1) have an electrical power source, be protected by a surge protector, and safely withstand static electricity;</p>
                  <p>(2) have an illuminated display of the monetary value of currency validated;</p>
                  <p>(3) have a time and date generator to record, display on an illuminated display, and maintain, at a minimum, the last 25 instances in which the ticket door and cash compartment were opened; and</p>
                  <p>(4) have a tamper-resistant component that contains a programming code identical to the equipment specification approved for use in Minnesota by an independent testing laboratory.</p>
                  <p>B. The column and dispensing features of a paper pull-tab dispensing device must comply with the following.</p>
                  <p>(1) The paper pull-tab dispensing device must have dispensing columns located in a separately locking compartment and the columns must accommodate tickets of varying lengths, widths, and thicknesses.</p>
                  <p>(2) Based on the amount of currency validated, all tickets must be accurately dispensed.</p>
                  <p>(3) Cash or tickets may not be dispensed to pay a player for a winning ticket.</p>
                  <p>(4) A shatterproof covering must be placed directly in front of the columns, and the paper pull-tab dispensing device must contain an outlet or tray to catch dispensed tickets.</p>
                  <p>(5) The paper pull-tab dispensing device must have at least one player button on the front which, when pressed, activates the dispensing of a ticket.</p>
                  <p>(6) If a malfunction occurs when the paper pull-tab dispensing device contains only one deal in one column, the device must become inoperable for that deal until the columns are adjusted or a new game is added.</p>
                  <p>(7) If a malfunction occurs when the paper pull-tab dispensing device contains more than one deal and the malfunction occurs in one of the columns containing a particular game, all of the columns containing tickets for that game must become inoperable until the malfunction is cleared.</p>
                  <p>(8) If electrical power is interrupted after currency has been validated but prior to paper pull-tabs being dispensed, the dollar amount of validated currency must be accurately redisplayed immediately after electrical power is restored.</p>
                  <p>(9) When tickets in a deal are dispensed from two or more columns and tickets remain in only one column, the tickets may continue to be dispensed without further splitting into multiple columns.</p>
                  <p>C. The accounting and access features must comply with the following.</p>
                  <p>(1) Accounting meters must redundantly and perpetually track the total currency validated and the total number of paper pull-tabs dispensed.</p>
                  <p>(2) One accounting meter must perpetually track the number of tickets dispensed from each column.</p>
                  <p>(3) Accounting meters must not be cleared, erased, or replaced unless the board is notified and has given its approval.</p>
                  <p>(4) Accounting information must be at least six numbers in length, and information must be retained for at least six months after electrical power to the paper pull-tab dispensing device has been disconnected or turned off.</p>
                  <p>(5) When any nonresettable accounting meter or any component essential to the secure operation is disconnected, operation must automatically discontinue.</p>
                  <p>(6) When in a test-vend or audit mode, test-vends of tickets or currency acceptances must not be recorded on the accounting meters. "Test-vend" means the intentional accepting of currency or vending of paper pull-tabs to properly calibrate columns to accept currency and vend paper pull-tabs of varying lengths, widths, and thicknesses. The paper pull-tab dispensing device must not perform test-vends of tickets or currency acceptances unless it is in a test-vend or audit mode and the exterior door of the paper pull-tab dispensing device is open.</p>
                  <p>(7) The manufacturer must not furnish more than four keys to the exterior locking door, and not more than four keys to each separate locking compartment. The keys to the cash compartment may not be the same as the keys to the cash box.</p>
                  <p>D. The electronic currency validator must:</p>
                  <p>(1) accept and validate only United States currency and be capable of preventing acceptance of known manipulations of the currency and returning invalid currency to a player;</p>
                  <p>(2) transmit the value of currency validated;</p>
                  <p>(3) ensure that tickets will not be dispensed unless the validator has accepted and retained currency;</p>
                  <p>(4) automatically discontinue accepting or validating currency if a malfunction should occur or if electrical power to the paper pull-tab dispensing device or currency validator is interrupted; and</p>
                  <p>(5) have at least one removable stacker box that can stack at least 600 United States currency bills or have at least one removable drop box. The box must be located in a separately locking compartment.</p>
                  <p>E. Each paper pull-tab dispensing device must be designed and constructed so that it can be securely attached to a floor, wall, or counter, and the appearance or design must not resemble a slot machine or other gambling device.</p>
                  <p>F. Any paper pull-tab dispensing device provided to a licensed distributor for demonstration purposes must be clearly and permanently marked for use as a demonstration device only.</p>

                  <p>B. If a manual audit or other game determination by organization employees or volunteers is conducted while a game is in play, termination of the entire game must immediately occur. An audit or game determination includes a determination of the individual prizes won or individual prizes remaining to be won.</p>
                  <p>C. The organization's gambling manager may choose an automatic game close feature before putting games into play.</p>
                  <p>D. For purposes of this part:</p>
                  <p>(1) "game determination" means determining how many winning tickets remain in a game, or the individual prizes won, or the individual prizes remaining to be won, while a game is in play;</p>
                  <p>(2) "finite details" means the number of tickets played, the number of winning tickets revealed, the denominations of prizes paid or remaining, and the number of tickets remaining to be played;</p>
                  <p>(3) "manual game close" means a real-time command by the gambling manager or authorized organization member to close a game and permanently end ticket sales for that game; and</p>
                  <p>(4) "automatic game close" or "auto close" means an automated program, approved by the board, that applies chosen parameters, selected by the gambling manager, used to determine whether to close a game in play. The parameters may trigger a game to close during or after business hours.</p>
                  <p>E. Daily reports will be made available to the licensed organization's authorized personnel that contain data relating to gross ticket sales and gross prizes paid on a per-game basis.</p>
                  <p>F. An electronic pull-tab game system must allow for the early termination of games as determined by the licensed organization's authorized personnel.</p>
                  <p>G. Access to the reporting portal must be secure and limited only to the gambling manager, authorized organization members who are not sellers, the organization's accountant, and the licensed distributor that leased the electronic game system to the organization. Access to the portal requires a unique identifying code and password for each individual user:</p>
                  <p>(1) sellers may not have reporting portal access; and</p>
                  <p>(2) the persons identified in this item may only view the daily and overall activity totals for gross receipts, prizes paid, net receipts, unredeemed credits, cash in, cash out, and payout percentage for games in play.</p>
                  <p>H. Any individual with access to the reporting portal may not play electronic games.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">38</inline>. <b>Prior board approval required for electronic gambling equipment; conformance with standards for previously approved electronic gambling equipment; independent laboratory testing required for certain electronic gambling equipment.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>This subpart applies to board approval of electronic gambling equipment, conformance with standards for previously approved electronic gambling equipment, and independent laboratory testing required for certain electronic gambling equipment.</p>
                  <p>A. Before the sale, lease, or distribution of any electronic gambling equipment in Minnesota, a manufacturer must obtain prior board approval for the electronic gambling equipment. The manufacturer must provide to the director at no charge the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) the list of proposed equipment in an electronic format or other format approved by the board;</p>
                  <p>(2) the electronic pull-tab games and flare information; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the electronic pull-tab game test system and equipment to be used to determine compliance with this part.</p>
                  <p>B. Electronic pull-tab deals submitted for approval of a new family of games proposed for production or already in production but not yet approved for sale in Minnesota or new members to a previously approved family of games must include:</p>
                  <p>(1) the front of the flare, prize pool board if any, ticket for each game, and any cumulative or progressive jackpot flare;</p>
                  <p>(2) the inside of the ticket showing the symbols in the boxes and the win indicators;</p>
                  <p>(3) the winning and losing symbols;</p>
                  <p>(4) the payout structure; and</p>
                  <p>(5) for new members of a previously approved family of games, the date when that family of games was previously approved by the board.</p>
                  <p>C. Electronic gambling equipment must be received by the board on or before the 15th day of the month to ensure consideration at the board's meeting the following month. The manufacturer must include information on any equipment that will be sold or leased on an exclusive basis according to part 7864.0240, subpart 1a.</p>
                  <p>D. The board must notify the manufacturer in writing no later than five days after a board meeting of the board's decision on whether the product is approved for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>E. For changes to the payout structure or ticket count for any approved game or for any game within a family of games, the manufacturer must assign a new game form number and submit the game for review and approval by the board before being offered for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>F. For changes to approved electronic gambling equipment, the manufacturer must submit the changes to the director for review, and, if required by the director, the equipment must be submitted for review and approval by the board.</p>
                  <p>(1) The version of gambling equipment containing changes approved by the director under this item is the only version of gambling equipment allowed to be available for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>(2) Handheld, portable electronic devices with power cords approved before July 15, 2019, may remain in play for 180 days from July 15, 2019, at which time the devices must be permanently removed from play. All other previously approved electronic gambling equipment approved before July 15, 2019, must come into compliance within 180 days of July 15, 2019.</p>
                  <p>G. Within 14 days of receipt of a deal, the director must notify the manufacturer in writing of the director's decision to recommend approval or recommend denial of a game.</p>
                  <p>(1) The written notice of the director's recommended denial must state the basis for the director's recommendation of denial. Within 14 days of receipt of a notice of the director's recommended denial, the manufacturer may request a contested case hearing under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>(2) The written notice of the board's denial must state the basis for the board's denial.</p>
                  <p>H. Manufacturers are in compliance if the electronic gambling equipment is approved by the board and is produced in compliance with the manufacturing standards prescribed in this part. Once approved, a manufacturer may not change the equipment without prior approval of the board, in compliance with this part. The board may withdraw its approval if it determines that the electronic gambling equipment:</p>
                  <p>(1) was not manufactured in such a manner to be tamper-resistant; or</p>
                  <p>(2) is defective and the defect is not immediately corrected and submitted to the board for reapproval for sale in Minnesota.</p>
                  <p>If the board decides that its approval should be withdrawn, the board will notify the manufacturer of its right to request a contested case hearing under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>I. Not later than December 31 of each calendar year, a manufacturer must submit to the board, on a form prescribed by the board, a list of all board-approved games that it intends to sell in Minnesota. Any board-approved game not included on the manufacturer's list, or any board-approved game that has not been played by a licensed organization in Minnesota in the previous two calendar years, will be considered abandoned by the manufacturer and will be removed from the board's approved games database. Nothing in this subpart prohibits a manufacturer from voluntarily informing the board at any time of an abandoned game. A voluntarily abandoned game may not be provided by a manufacturer for play in Minnesota unless the game is reapproved by the director. Abandoned games already uploaded for play by a licensed organization before December 31 may continue to be played until the game is closed.</p>
                  <p>J. Electronic gambling equipment, including electronic bingo devices, electronic pull-tab devices, electronic systems, and programmable electronic devices, that are submitted for approval must consist of the following:</p>
                  <p>(1) a copy of the manufacturer's catalog or brochure illustrating that the item meets board-prescribed manufacturing standards for the equipment; and</p>
                  <p>(2) a description of the item and its features.</p>
                  <p>The board may require the manufacturer to make the equipment available to the board for inspection. In addition to the requirements of subitems (1) and (2), manufacturers submitting electronic bingo devices, electronic pull-tab devices, electronic systems, or programmable electronic devices for approval must also include a certification from an independent testing laboratory approved by the board to perform testing services, stating that the equipment has been tested and analyzed and meets the standards required in this chapter. The board may require that a programmable electronic device must be tested and certified by an independent testing laboratory approved by the board.</p>
                  <p>K. Independent testing requirements for electronic gambling equipment when required by the board shall include a certification from a board-approved testing laboratory that the electronic gambling equipment tested meets the manufacturing standards and requirements as established in Minnesota Statutes and Minnesota Rules and in conformance with game procedures as provided by the manufacturer. The certification must include:</p>
                  <p>(1) a detailed description of the equipment and related software applications that were tested, including applicable model numbers of specific equipment and the software version of the application used for testing;</p>
                  <p>(2) the specific reference to the standard being tested;</p>
                  <p>(3) a statement that the equipment meets the standard; and</p>
                  <p>(4) any additional findings or issues of concern that might affect the performance or play of the equipment.</p>

                  <p>A. Within three business days of receipt of notification from the board, the manufacturer must initiate the recall of gambling equipment from licensed distributors or linked bingo game providers.</p>
                  <p>B. Within 25 business days of initiating the recall, the manufacturer must complete the recall and notify the board in writing that the recall has been completed. The notification must include:</p>
                  <p>(1) an inventory listing of the gambling equipment that was returned or not returned;</p>
                  <p>(2) bar code information as required by the commissioner of revenue; and</p>
                  <p>(3) listing of all distributors or linked bingo game providers, including license numbers, from whom the gambling equipment was recalled.</p>
                  <p>C. Within 15 business days of notifying the board as required by item B, the manufacturer must issue credit invoices to distributors or linked bingo game providers for the cost of the gambling equipment returned, including any valid and documented losses over which the organization had no control or ability to prevent and which were reimbursed by distributors or linked bingo game providers. Copies of the credit invoices must be filed electronically as required by the commissioner of revenue.</p>
                  <p>D. If a recalled paper pull-tab or tipboard game cannot be brought into compliance with the standards, the manufacturer must destroy the game. At the board's request, the manufacturer must submit an affidavit stating that the equipment was destroyed.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">7</inline>. <b>Report of delinquent distributor or linked bingo game provider required.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>This subpart pertains to the notice to the board that a distributor or linked bingo game provider is delinquent in payment of an invoice or lease agreement.</p>
                  <p>A. If a manufacturer has not received payment from a distributor or linked bingo game provider within 30 days of the day immediately following the date of invoice or lease agreement, the manufacturer must report the delinquency to the board in writing in an electronic format authorized by the board. The manufacturer must ensure that the board will receive the notice by the 31st day, or the next business day, after the invoice date for the sale or lease of the gambling equipment. The notice must include:</p>
                  <p>(1) the distributor's or linked bingo game provider's name and license number; and</p>
                  <p>(2) an invoice or lease agreement date, invoice number, and total dollar amount of the invoice or lease agreement.</p>
                  <p>B. If a manufacturer has not received payment in full within 60 days of its initial notice to the board, the manufacturer must notify the board of the continued delinquency. The manufacturer must ensure that the board will receive the notice on the 61st day, or the next business day, after the manufacturer's initial report to the board.</p>
                  <p>C. When the delinquency is paid, the manufacturer must notify the board immediately.</p>
                  <p>D. Upon receipt of the initial notice under item A, the board must:</p>
                  <p>(1) notify and direct the distributor or linked bingo game provider to eliminate the delinquency; and</p>
                  <p>(2) notify all manufacturers that until further notice they may only sell or lease gambling equipment to the delinquent distributor or linked bingo game provider on a cash basis. "Cash" means a debit card payment, check, electronic transaction, money order, or cashier's check.</p>
                  <p>E. Upon receipt of the second notice under item B, the board must notify:</p>
                  <p>(1) the distributor or linked bingo game provider that the sale and lease of gambling equipment to the distributor or linked bingo game provider will not be authorized until the delinquency is eliminated; and</p>
                  <p>(2) all manufacturers that they may not sell or lease any gambling equipment to the delinquent distributor or linked bingo game provider.</p>
                  <p>F. When the board has been notified that the delinquency is paid in full, the board must notify all manufacturers that the delinquency has been paid and that the sale or lease of gambling equipment to the distributor or linked bingo game provider is authorized.</p>
                  <p>G. Until authorized by the board, a manufacturer may not extend credit or sell or lease gambling equipment to a distributor or linked bingo game provider in violation of an order under items D and E.</p>

                  <p>The following terms have the meanings given them in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>A. "Suspension" means that the licensee keeps its license or premises permit, even though its conduct of lawful gambling in Minnesota must stop during the time of suspension.</p>
                  <p>B. "Revocation" means that the license or premises permit is terminated on the effective date of revocation.</p>
                  <p>C. "Complete change of ownership" means that when a violation occurred a person who was the lessor or owner of a site, an immediate family member of a lessor or owner, a person residing in the same household as an owner or lessor, or who otherwise held a direct or indirect financial interest of five percent or more in the site is currently not:</p>
                  <p>(1) a lessor or owner of the site;</p>
                  <p>(2) an immediate family member of the new lessor or owner of the site;</p>
                  <p>(3) a person residing in the same household as a lessor or owner of the site; or</p>
                  <p>(4) a holder of a direct or indirect financial interest of five percent or more in the site.</p>
                  <p>An appropriately recorded contract for deed does not constitute a prohibited direct or indirect financial interest. The existence of a complete change of ownership is an affirmative defense of an organization that has, or is applying for, a premises permit for the site.</p>

                  <p>When the board has determined that a violation of part 7861.0260, subpart 1, item J, has occurred based on Minnesota Statutes, section 349.155, subdivision 4a, paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), the board must suspend or revoke an organization's premises permit as follows.</p>
                  <p>A. For the first violation of part 7861.0260, subpart 1, item J, at a site, the board must suspend each premises permit for the site for up to 90 days from the date of the board's final resolution or determination on the violation. An organization may not pay rent for the site during the term of the suspension. When suspending an organization's premises permit, the board must consider the following factors:</p>
                  <p>(1) whether the organization notified the lessor, in writing, that illegal gambling was being conducted on the premises, giving specific information regarding the conduct of the illegal gambling, and requesting that the lessor take appropriate action;</p>
                  <p>(2) whether the organization, or any of its agents, knew that the game or device that violated part 7861.0260, subpart 1, item J, was used, or was designed to be capable of being used, in a manner that causes illegal gambling or violates part 7861.0260, subpart 1, item J, or Minnesota Statutes, section 609.75;</p>
                  <p>(3) the degree to which the organization cooperated with law enforcement authorities, the Department of Public Safety Gambling Enforcement Division, or the board;</p>
                  <p>(4) whether the organization or any of its agents participated in the illegal gambling; and</p>
                  <p>(5) the nature or severity of the violation.</p>
                  <p>B. For the second violation of part 7861.0260, subpart 1, item J, at a site, the board must suspend each premises permit for the site for two years from the date of the board's final resolution or determination on the violation. An organization may not pay rent for the site during the term of the suspension. If a complete change of ownership occurred between the first and second violations, the second violation is considered a first violation and the board must suspend each premises permit for the site for up to 90 days according to item A and must prohibit any organization from paying rent during the term of the suspension.</p>
                  <p>C. For the third violation of part 7861.0260, subpart 1, item J, at a site, the board must revoke each premises permit for the site for a minimum period of five years from the date of the board's final resolution or determination on the violation. Revocation must continue until a complete change of ownership occurs after the third violation. No organization may obtain a premises permit for the site during the term of the revocation. If a complete change of ownership occurred between the second and third violations, the third violation is considered a first violation and the board must suspend each premises permit for the site for up to 90 days according to item A and must prohibit any organization from paying rent for the site during the term of the suspension.</p>
                  <p>If the licensee does not enter into a consent order with the board according to the provisions of this subpart, and part 7865.0210, subpart 2, item I, the suspension or revocation of a premises permit is a contested case under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>

A licensee is not entitled to a stay of imposition if the board determines that the potential or actual harm to the public and the integrity of lawful gambling resulting from the grant of such a stay would exceed the harm to the licensee from the denial of such a stay.</p>

                  <p>This subpart applies to requests for stays of impositions of sanctions:</p>
                  <p>A. A licensee seeking a stay according to subpart 1 must file a written request with the board. The request must contain:</p>
                  <p>(1) a copy of the licensee's appeal to the court of appeals and proof that the appeal has been filed with the court of appeals;</p>
                  <p>(2) a brief statement describing why the harm the licensee would suffer from the denial of a stay exceeds the potential or actual harm to the public and the integrity of lawful gambling that would result from the grant of a stay; and</p>
                  <p>(3) a copy of the order issued by the board imposing the sanction the licensee seeks to have stayed.</p>
                  <p>B. Any request for a stay complying with item A must be considered by the chair of the board according to subpart 1.</p>
                  <p>(1) The chair must respond to the applicant in writing within five days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, of the date the application is received by the board.</p>
                  <p>(2) The chair must grant or deny the stay and explain the reasons for the decision.</p>
                  <p>(3) The chair's decision represents the official board response to the request until the board is able to consider the request according to item C.</p>
                  <p>C. Any request for a stay must be considered by the board after initial consideration and response by the chair.</p>
                  <p>(1) If the chair has granted the licensee's request for the stay, the board must consider the request at its next regularly scheduled meeting.</p>
                  <p>(2) If the chair has denied the request, the chair must call a special board meeting to consider the licensee's request for a stay. The special meeting must be held no later than ten days after the chair has issued a written response to the request.</p>
                  <p>(3) When the board considers the request for a stay, it must grant or deny the stay according to subpart 1 and issue a written order containing its decision and the reasons for the decision within five days of the date it considers the request. The board's decision is considered a final agency action.</p>

                  <p>(2) an ongoing variance of a rule;</p>

                  <p>In addition to the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 14.056, the board must approve or deny a variance request according to the following procedures:</p>
                  <p>A. Upon receipt of a variance request, the board must notify the requesting licensee of the time, date, and place of the board meeting at which the variance will be considered. The board will consider variance requests during its regularly scheduled monthly meeting.</p>
                  <p>B. The board may request the licensee to submit additional information regarding the variance request, or to appear before the board to provide additional information. If the board determines that the licensee must appear before the board, the board must provide advance notice to the licensee before the board meeting at which the variance request is considered. This procedure is not a contested case hearing as defined in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>C. If the licensee requesting the variance fails to follow the procedures in this part, the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 14.056, or fails to appear before the board when requested, the board must deny the variance request.</p>

                  <p>The board may approve a variance from any of its rules if it finds that all of the following criteria have been met:</p>
                  <p>A. strict application of the rule would cause undue and substantial hardship to the licensee applying for the variance;</p>
                  <p>B. approving the variance does not confer a benefit on the licensee which is not enjoyed by other licensees similarly situated;</p>
                  <p>C. approving the variance does not substantially impair the intent and purposes of the board's rules;</p>
                  <p>D. the variance can be approved without impacting the integrity of lawful gambling, or the public health, safety, or welfare;</p>
                  <p>E. approving the variance does not allow violation of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 297E, 299L, or 349; and</p>
                  <p>F. the variance is for a onetime variance for the licensee, not an ongoing variance of the rule.</p>

                  <p>A licensed distributor, linked bingo game provider, or manufacturer may appeal the denial of a renewal application.</p>
                  <p>A. To appeal the denial, the licensee must file a written request for a contested case hearing with the board within 15 days of receiving notice that the application has been denied.</p>
                  <p>B. Upon receipt of the request, the board must schedule a contested case hearing before an administrative law judge under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.</p>
                  <p>C. The hearing must be held no later than 30 days after the board receives the request for the hearing unless the licensee and the board agree on a later date.</p>
                  <p>D. If the licensee fails to appear at the hearing after having been notified of it, the licensee is considered in default and the proceeding may be determined against the licensee on consideration of the written notice of denial, the allegations of which may be considered to be true.</p>
                  <p>E. The board must issue its final decision within 30 days after receipt of the administrative law judge's report and subsequent exceptions and argument under Minnesota Statutes, section 14.61. The board may enter an order making the disposition that the facts require.</p>
                  <p>F. If no hearing is requested within 30 days of the service of the notice, the denial becomes final.</p>
