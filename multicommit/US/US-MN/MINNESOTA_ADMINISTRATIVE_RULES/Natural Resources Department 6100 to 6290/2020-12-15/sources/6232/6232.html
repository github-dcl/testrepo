Persons 12 years of age or older may enter the preference drawing by supplying their driver's license number, official state of Minnesota Identification Number, or 13-digit Firearms Safety Identification Number on the application, except that resident hunters under age 16 on the Saturday nearest November 6 may not apply for either-sex permits. All applicants who have reached their 18th birthday by the first Thursday following Labor Day must provide one of these three numbers to qualify. Applicants under 18 years of age who do not submit one of these numbers will be assigned a number and will be entered into the preference drawing. Applicants establish a preference rating based upon the number of times they have applied in previous years and have not obtained an either-sex or special hunt area permit. The preference rating will increase each year the applicant applies unsuccessfully for either an either-sex or special hunt area permit. Persons applying for the first time have no preference.
