In deciding whether to let an applicant repeat an assessment, the commissioner shall consider the type of assessment questions involved, the effect of memory and practice, the availability of unassessed applicants, and other circumstances regarding the assessment, the needs of the agency, and situations of individual applicants. If the same assessment is used more than once within a six-month period for the same or a different classification, applicants who have been refused the opportunity to retake the assessment because of a six-month prohibition will be considered based upon their results obtained on the previously taken assessment.</p>

                  <p>The jurisdiction must submit the information listed in items A to H for each job class which had employees at any time in calendar year 1991, unless the class was abolished on or before December 31, 1991.</p>
                  <p>The information provided must be as of December 31, 1991, except that for classes which were vacant on that date the information must be as of the most recent date when the class was occupied, as specified in items B, C, D, and F.</p>
                  <p>A. Class title. If the jurisdiction has a two-tier pay system, and there were employees in both tiers on December 31, 1991, the jurisdiction must report each tier as a separate class. The information in items B to H must be reported separately for each tier.</p>
                  <p>"Two-tier pay system" means a pay practice in which two classes with the same duties, responsibilities, and general qualifications have different pay range minimums or maximums, or in which more recently-hired employees progress through the pay range at a different rate than less recently-hired employees.</p>
                  <p>B. Male employees. For classes which were vacant on December 31, 1991, the jurisdiction must report the number of male employees as of the most recent date when the class was occupied.</p>
                  <p>C. Female employees. For classes which were vacant on December 31, 1991, the jurisdiction must report the number of female employees as of the most recent date when the class was occupied.</p>
                  <p>D. Class type. The jurisdiction must identify the class type (male-dominated, female-dominated, or balanced) as defined by Minnesota Statutes, section 471.991. For classes which were vacant on December 31, 1991, the class type must be as of the most recent date when the class was occupied.</p>
                  <p>E. Comparable work value. The jurisdiction must report the job evaluation rating (comparable work value) of the class as determined by the job evaluation system.</p>
                  <p>F. Salary. The jurisdiction must report the minimum and maximum monthly salary, as determined by subitems (1) to (4). If there is no salary range for the class, the jurisdiction must note that information in the space provided on the form.</p>
                  <p>(1) For classes with an established hourly wage, jurisdictions must multiply the minimum and maximum hourly wages by 173.3 to determine the minimum and maximum monthly wage. When there is no established hourly wage, and there is only an annual wage, jurisdictions must divide the minimum and maximum annual wages by the number of months worked to determine the minimum and maximum monthly wages.</p>
                  <p>If the wage is for a class in which all employees work less than full-time equivalents, the minimum and maximum monthly wages must be adjusted to represent the full-time equivalent wage. The jurisdiction must make the adjustment by determining the minimum and maximum hourly wage and multiplying that amount by 173.3.</p>
                  <p>(2) If any employee in the class is paid less than the minimum of the wage range, or if no wage range exists, the jurisdiction must list the lowest wage actually paid any employee in the class as the minimum monthly salary. For classes which were vacant on December 31, 1991, and for which no wage range exists, the jurisdiction must list the lowest wage actually paid any employee in the class as of the most recent date when the class was occupied.</p>
                  <p>(3) If any employee in the class is paid more than the maximum of the wage range, or if no wage range exists, the jurisdiction must list the highest wage actually paid any employee in the class as the maximum. For classes which were vacant on December 31, 1991, and for which no wage range exists, the jurisdiction must list the highest wage actually paid any employee in the class as of the most recent date when the class was occupied.</p>
                  <p>(4) If any class received additional cash compensation at any time from July 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991, and if that payment resulted in pay above the wage range maximum, that payment must be prorated to determine a monthly equivalent. The prorated amount must be added to the wage range maximum in calculating the maximum monthly salary.</p>
                  <p>G. Years to maximum. The jurisdiction must report the number of years required to qualify for the maximum monthly salary. If no salary range exists, the jurisdiction must report the number of years of service in the class for the employee with the highest actual monthly salary.</p>
                  <p>H. Exceptional service pay. The jurisdiction must report the type of exceptional service pay received, if any employee in the class was receiving longevity or performance payments which resulted in pay above the salary range maximum.</p>

                  <p>The jurisdiction must report whether or not eligibility for benefits, or the jurisdiction's contribution limit for benefits, is different for any male-dominated and female-dominated classes of comparable work value. Classes are of comparable work value for purposes of this subpart if their job evaluation ratings are within a range of ratings equal to ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings in the jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>The total range of evaluation ratings is determined by subtracting the lowest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction from the highest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction. The rating corresponding to ten percent of that amount is determined by dividing the total range of evaluation ratings by ten.</p>
                  <p>To determine whether differences exist, jurisdictions must compare benefits eligibility and contribution limits for each female-dominated class to benefits eligibility and contribution limits for each male-dominated class within an evaluation range extending from ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings below the female-dominated class to ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings above the female-dominated class.</p>
                  <p>If differences exist, and if the differences represent a lower contribution limit or more limited eligibility for any female-dominated class, the jurisdiction must report the following information for all classes:</p>
                  <p>A. eligibility or lack of eligibility for each benefit program; and</p>
                  <p>B. the amount of the employer's contribution limit for each benefit program, prorated to determine monthly value.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">4</inline>. <b>Determining predicted pay.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The department must determine predicted pay for each male-dominated and female-dominated class in the jurisdiction. Predicted pay means predicted salary for those jurisdictions which do not have different benefits for male-dominated and female-dominated classes of comparable work value, as described in part 3920.0300, subpart 6. For those jurisdictions which do have different benefits for male-dominated and female-dominated classes of comparable work value, predicted pay means the total predicted amount of salary plus benefits contribution limits.</p>
                  <p>The department must determine predicted pay by creating a window, drawing a regression line within the window, and identifying a predicted pay point on the regression line. The process described in items A to D is continued until pay has been predicted for each male-dominated and female-dominated class in the jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>A. Creating a window. The analysis creates a window around the class. The window defines classes of comparable work value for purposes of the statistical analysis. Except as provided in item B, each window represents 20 percent of the total range of job evaluation ratings in the jurisdiction. The total range of evaluation ratings is determined by subtracting the lowest rating assigned to any class from the highest rating assigned to any class. The result is then multiplied by 20 and divided by 100. In addition, the window must meet the criteria in subitems (1) to (4).</p>
                  <p>(1) The lower limit of the window is below the evaluation rating of the class being analyzed by ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings, except when the class being analyzed is in the bottom ten percent or the top ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings. The upper limit of the window is above the evaluation rating of the class being analyzed by ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings, except when the class being analyzed is in the top ten percent or the bottom ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings.</p>
                  <p>(a) If the evaluation rating of the class being analyzed is in the bottom ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings, the lower limit of the window is the lowest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction and the upper limit of the window is 20 percent above the lower limit.</p>
                  <p>(b) If the evaluation rating of the class being analyzed is in the top ten percent of the total range of evaluation ratings, the upper limit of the window is the highest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction and the lower limit of the window is 20 percent below the upper limit.</p>
                  <p>(2) The window must include at least three male-dominated job classes. When analyzing a male-dominated job class, the class being analyzed is counted as one of the three male-dominated job classes.</p>
                  <p>(3) The window must include at least two male-dominated job classes with different job evaluation ratings. When analyzing a male-dominated job class, the class being analyzed is counted as one of the two male-dominated job classes with different ratings.</p>
                  <p>(4) The window must include at least 20 percent of all the male-dominated classes in the jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>B. Expanding the window. If any of the criteria in item A, subitems (2) to (4), are not met, the window is expanded in increments of five percent of the total range of evaluation ratings on both sides of the previous window, except as provided in subitems (1) and (2). That is, in the first expansion the lower limit becomes the rating level 15 percent below the class being analyzed and the upper limit becomes the rating level 15 percent above the class being analyzed. The window is increased using these five percent increments as many times as necessary until the criteria in item A, subitems (2) to (4), are met.</p>
                  <p>(1) If the expansion results in a lower limit below the lowest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction, then the lower limit is the lowest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction. The upper limit is above the lower limit by the total length of the expanded window, that is, 30 percent in the first expansion, 40 percent in the second expansion, and so forth. The window is expanded until the criteria in item A, subitems (2) to (4), are met.</p>
                  <p>(2) If the expansion results in an upper limit above the highest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction, then the upper limit is the highest rating assigned to any class in the jurisdiction. The lower limit is below the upper limit by the total length of the expanded window, that is, 30 percent in the first expansion, 40 percent in the second expansion, and so forth. The window is expanded until the criteria in item A, subitems (2) to (4), are met.</p>
                  <p>C. Drawing a line. Using conventional statistical regression techniques, the analysis fits a linear regression line to all male-dominated classes in the window. The line is weighted to reflect the number of employees in each male-dominated class. The regression line represents the relationship between job evaluation ratings and salary, or between job evaluation ratings and salary plus benefits in the case of jurisdictions with different benefits for male-dominated and female-dominated classes of comparable work value, as explained in part 3920.0300, subpart 6.</p>
                  <p>D. Predicting pay. The analysis predicts pay for the class being analyzed by determining the dollar value on the regression line which corresponds to the job evaluation rating of the class being analyzed.</p>

                  <p>The analysis tabulates the number of female-dominated and male-dominated classes which are paid below predicted pay for their job evaluation ratings. The analysis then calculates female-dominated classes paid below predicted pay as a percentage of all female-dominated classes in the jurisdiction, and male-dominated classes paid below predicted pay as a percentage of all male-dominated classes in the jurisdiction, as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. the number of male-dominated classes which are paid below predicted pay is divided by the total number of male-dominated classes, and the result is multiplied by 100;</p>
                  <p>B. the number of female-dominated classes which are paid below predicted pay is divided by the total number of female-dominated classes, and the result is multiplied by 100; and</p>
                  <p>C. the result from item A is divided by the result from item B, and the quotient is multiplied by 100 and rounded to one decimal place. This is the underpayment ratio.</p>

                  <p>For a jurisdiction described in subpart 6, item C, the department must determine and analyze the average pay difference. The average pay difference is the dollar amount of the average difference from predicted pay, calculated as follows:</p>
                  <p>A. The number of employees in each female-dominated class is multiplied by the dollar amount of the difference from predicted pay for that class. Both positive amounts (above predicted pay) and negative amounts (below predicted pay) are included.</p>
                  <p>B. The sum of the amounts in item A is divided by the total number of employees in female-dominated classes and rounded to the nearest whole dollar. The result is the average difference from predicted pay for female-dominated classes.</p>
                  <p>C. The process explained in items A and B is repeated for male-dominated classes. The result is the average difference from predicted pay for male-dominated classes.</p>

                  <p>If the average pay difference represents a disadvantage for female-dominated classes, a standard test of statistical significance called the t-test must be applied to this finding. The department must evaluate the results as explained in items A and B.</p>
                  <p>A. The t-test of pooled variance is applied using conventional statistical techniques. Significance is determined at the five percent level for a one-tailed test. The statistical analysis rounds the value of t to three decimal places. The sample t table is taken from a standard statistical text: Blalock, Social Statistics, Second Edition 1972, published by McGraw-Hill, page 559. The degrees of freedom is the total number of employees in male-dominated and female-dominated classes, minus two. To be significant, the value of t for a jurisdiction must be at or above the level listed, except that for degrees of freedom not listed, the required level of t is taken from a standard normal distribution table.</p>

                  <p>B. for classes with no salary ranges, differences in years of service explain the underpayment for all underpaid female-dominated classes, as described in subpart 6;</p>
                  <p>C. for classes with no salary ranges, differences in performance, separately or in combination with differences in years of service, explain the underpayment for all underpaid female-dominated classes, as described in subpart 7; or</p>
                  <p>D. for classes with no salary ranges, combined differences in years of service and performance explain the underpayment for some of the underpaid female-dominated classes, and the remaining number of underpaid female-dominated classes is 20.0 percent, or less, of female-dominated classes in the jurisdiction, as explained in subparts 6 and 7.</p>

                  <p>The analysis is based on the maximum monthly salaries and job evaluation ratings listed in the jurisdiction's implementation report, except as described below. If the jurisdiction has no salary ranges, the analysis is based on the highest actual salary paid for each class. If a jurisdiction provides different benefits to male-dominated and female-dominated classes of comparable work value, and if those differences represent a disadvantage to any female-dominated class, the analysis is based on the jurisdiction's benefits contribution limit plus the maximum monthly salary, or on the jurisdiction's benefits contribution limit plus the highest salary actually paid for each class.</p>

                  <p>The department must conduct an initial review to determine whether salary, or salary plus benefits, for female-dominated classes is not consistently below that of male-dominated classes of comparable work value. The department must examine salary or salary plus benefits for each female-dominated class using the criteria in items A to D, and must identify each female-dominated class which is underpaid. For purposes of this part, "underpaid" means paid less than the level established by these criteria.</p>
                  <p>The department must count the number of underpaid female-dominated classes and calculate underpaid female-dominated classes as a percentage of all female-dominated classes in the jurisdiction. If 20.0 percent or a smaller percentage of female-dominated classes are underpaid according to the criteria in items A to D, the department must find that the jurisdiction has passed the alternative analysis test. If more than 20.0 percent of female-dominated classes are underpaid according to these criteria, the department must proceed as explained in subpart 5.</p>
                  <p>A. If there are any female-dominated classes with higher job evaluation ratings than male-dominated classes, and there are no male-dominated classes with ratings higher than those female-dominated classes, the amount of salary or salary plus benefits for each of those female-dominated classes must be equal to or higher than the amounts for each lower-rated male-dominated class.</p>
                  <p>B. If there are any female-dominated classes with job evaluation ratings falling between lower-rated and higher-rated male-dominated classes, the amount of salary or salary plus benefits for each of the female-dominated classes must fall between the amounts for the male-dominated classes.</p>

If there are any female-dominated classes with the same job evaluation ratings as male-dominated classes, the amount of salary or salary plus benefits for each of those female-dominated classes must be equal to or higher than the amounts for any of the male-dominated classes. This criterion does not apply if there are any male-dominated classes which are rated higher than the female-dominated class, but which receive salary or salary plus benefits amounts equal to or lower than the amounts for the female-dominated class.</p>
                  <p>D. If there are any female-dominated classes with job evaluation ratings lower than all male-dominated classes, those female-dominated classes must be compensated as reasonably in proportion to their job evaluation ratings as other classes in the jurisdiction.</p>

If a jurisdiction fails to submit a report by January 31, 1992, the department must find that jurisdiction not in compliance.</p>
                  <p>Any person or entity may submit a complaint about the accuracy or completeness of a jurisdiction's report by writing to the department. The complaint must specify the information believed to be inaccurate or incomplete. In response to a complaint, the department must decide either that the complaint is without merit and that no review is necessary, or that the complaint may have merit and a review is necessary.</p>
                  <p>In addition, the department may initiate a review of the accuracy and completeness of a jurisdiction's report for the purpose of ensuring that the compliance review is based upon correct and complete information.</p>
                  <p>If the department decides that a review is necessary, the department must notify the jurisdiction in writing that a review is being undertaken.

The department must establish and notify the jurisdiction of a reasonable time period for the jurisdiction to submit missing information or to verify the information.</p>
                  <p>If the jurisdiction does not respond within the established time period, or if the department determines after reviewing the response that the report remains inaccurate or incomplete, the department must find the jurisdiction not in compliance.</p>

The evaluation is limited to classes with an established number of years to reach maximum salary.</p>
                  <p>A. Calculate the average years to maximum for female-dominated classes by adding the years to maximum for female-dominated classes and dividing the result by the number of female-dominated classes.</p>

                  <p>(2) the higher compensation for male-dominated classes is needed to retain employees in those classes.</p>
                  <p>D. Recent arbitration. A jurisdiction may demonstrate that one or more female-dominated classes receive lower compensation than male-dominated classes because of recent arbitration awards that are inconsistent with equitable compensation relationships. The jurisdiction may submit any relevant information.</p>
                  <p>E. Good faith. A jurisdiction may demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to achieve compliance. The jurisdiction may submit any information supporting subitems (1) to (3).</p>
                  <p>(1) Since 1984, the jurisdiction has substantially reduced the frequency or amount of compensation inequities for female-dominated classes in comparison with male-dominated classes.</p>
                  <p>(2) Since 1984, a substantial portion of funds available for compensation increases has been spent on reducing compensation inequities for female-dominated classes.</p>
                  <p>(3) There is other evidence of the jurisdiction's good faith efforts to achieve compliance.</p>
                  <p>F. Continued progress. A jurisdiction may demonstrate its continued progress toward compliance. The jurisdiction may submit any relevant information.</p>
                  <p>G. Constraints. A jurisdiction may demonstrate any constraints it faces. The jurisdiction may submit any information supporting subitem (1) or (2).</p>
                  <p>(1) severe fiscal constraints have made implementation difficult or impossible; or</p>
                  <p>(2) there are other constraints which have made implementation of pay equity difficult or impossible.</p>
                  <p>H. Other evidence. A jurisdiction may submit any other information to demonstrate that the department's compliance decision was incorrect or that more time should be provided to achieve compliance.</p>

                  <p>A. an amount equivalent to five percent of the aid otherwise payable for calendar year 1992, calculated from January 1, 1992, added to an amount equivalent to five percent of the aid otherwise payable for all additional years after 1992, in which the department certifies that the jurisdiction remains not in compliance; or</p>
                  <p>B. an amount equivalent to $100 a day, calculated from January 1, 1992, until the date the department certifies to the Department of Revenue that the jurisdiction has achieved compliance.</p>

                  <p>The Department of Revenue must enforce the penalty by deducting aid or fining the jurisdiction. For purposes of this part, "aid" means amounts otherwise payable under Minnesota Statutes, section 126C.13, 273.1398, or 477A.011 to 477A.014. The Department of Revenue must determine which of the amounts in items A and B is larger, and deduct the aid or assess the fine accordingly:</p>
                  <p>A. an amount equivalent to five percent of the aid otherwise payable for the calendar year in which the department finds the jurisdiction not in compliance, added to an amount equivalent to five percent of the aid otherwise payable for all additional years in which the department certifies that the jurisdiction remains not in compliance; or</p>
                  <p>B. an amount equivalent to $100 a day, calculated from the date the department finds the jurisdiction not in compliance until the date the department certifies that the jurisdiction has achieved compliance.</p>
