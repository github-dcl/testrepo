The chief executive officer of the certified school shall, by October 1 of each year, file with the board an affirmative action plan and such other relevant information as the board may require.

                  <p>The board's duties with respect to certification include the following:</p>
                  <p>A. Not later than one year from the granting of provisional certification, the board shall grant or deny certification. Certification shall remain contingent upon periodic review by the board or by the executive director in addition to the requirements for a renewal application every five years as provided by item C.</p>
                  <p>B. Before a certified school offers any course from the professional peace officer education program at another site not included in its original application, the certified school must seek written approval from the board. The board shall consider those criteria in subpart 1 in determining whether the proposal will be approved.</p>
                  <p>C. By May 1, 1990, and every five years after that, the board must send a renewal application form to all certified schools. This application form must request information regarding the criteria contained in subpart 1. The coordinator must file the completed application with the board by November 1 of the year the application form was received. All applications for renewal of certification must be accompanied by evidence that the higher education system office governing the applicant school has approved the application of the school and, if required, that the application has been approved by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education. Upon review of the properly filed application form, the board shall renew the school's certification for another five years, if the board finds that the requirements of subpart 1 have been met. If a certified school does not comply with the requirements of this subpart, the school's certification will be deemed to have expired and the school will be required to reapply for certification under the procedures in subparts 1 and 2.</p>

                  <p>Nothing in parts 6700.0100 to 6700.1800 shall preclude or prevent any agency, political subdivision, civil service commission, or other appointing authority from publishing and enforcing rules, policies, or procedures which are more comprehensive than those minimum statewide standards set forth hereinafter. The responsibility for enforcing any rules, policies, or procedures which are more comprehensive than the following minimum standards of conduct remains with the promulgating agency, political subdivision, commission, or appointing authority.</p>

                  <p>The board believes that in order for the public to have confidence in the integrity and ability of law enforcement, it is paramount that peace officers demonstrate that they are capable of self-regulation. The board further believes that internal discipline is properly a function of the appointing authority and its political subdivision. These standards of conduct relate to licensure only and violations thereof do not enlarge on a peace officer's civil or criminal liability in any way.</p>

                <p>The board recognizes the complex and unpredictable factors associated with police pursuits. It is imperative that there be written procedures for these types of serious law enforcement operations. The board has identified the issues which the procedures must consider. Because police pursuits may involve peace officers from other jurisdictions, the board encourages each agency to advise neighboring agencies, or agencies which have concurrent jurisdictions, of its police pursuit policies.</p>
