        <p> Employees at or above the maximum salary rate for their class may be granted a salary adjustment only in the amount adopted by the merit system for all employees whose positions are not covered by the terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement.

        <p> An appointing authority may grant a salary increase within the salary range to an employee based upon unusual employment conditions that make the action necessary and the interests of the agency that will be served by the action. In granting this increase, the appointing authority shall give due consideration to the salary rates paid other employees in the same classification and shall not grant an increase that does not ensure equitable compensation for comparable work. Salary increases proposed according to this part are not based on employee performance or a general merit system adopted salary adjustment. The granting of such an increase shall not affect the employees' eligibility for subsequent merit increases or salary adjustments in accordance with merit system rules. If the unusual employment conditions giving rise to such an increase are of a temporary nature, the employee's salary shall be decreased to its previous level upon conclusion of those conditions.

      <p>When a position is reclassified resulting from a change in allocation the incumbent shall not be eligible to continue in the position except as provided in subpart 3 or unless eligible for original appointment, promotion, transfer, or demotion to the new class of positions. If ineligible to continue in such a position, the incumbent may be transferred, promoted, or demoted by appropriate action of the appointing authority in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter. If ineligibility of a permanent or probationary incumbent of a reclassified position arises from the existence of an eligible register established from an examination that the incumbent did not take, the incumbent may be permitted to take the same or equivalent examination from which the existing register was established without the examination being open for application. At that time, the county shall notify other employees that they may also apply and take the examination. The names of successful candidates examined under this part shall be placed on the existing register in accordance with the score attained. In any case in which the incumbent is ineligible to continue in the position and is not transferred, promoted, or demoted, the provisions of this chapter about layoff shall apply. Any transfer, promotion, demotion, or layoff in accordance with those provisions must occur within 60 days of the notification of reclassification of the position.</p>
