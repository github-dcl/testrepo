As part of the preadmission screening, the applicant's indicated preference for the waiting lists must be reviewed and amended if appropriate. An applicant may request movement from one waiting list to another at any time, unless the request is precluded by subpart 5. An applicant requesting movement from one waiting list to another must be placed at the bottom of the waiting list to which movement was requested.

A person who is discharged for failure to meet bed hold criteria in part 9050.0150, subpart 2 or 3, has priority for consideration for admission to a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs at an appropriate level of care if the person meets the criteria for that level of care and a bed is available. A person on the active waiting list must be considered for admission and, if approved by the admissions committee, offered a bed consistent with the person's position on the active waiting list and the patient classification system and level of care needs as determined by the admissions committee. A person offered admission has three working days to consider the offer. If the person declines the offer of admission, the person's name must be put on the bottom of the active waiting list, unless the person requests removal from the active waiting list or transfer to the inactive waiting list.

                  <p>The decision about admission to or continued stay in a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs licensed to provide boarding care must be based on the facility's ability to meet the care needs of the applicant or resident. A person whose care needs can be met by the facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs must be admitted, placed on the waiting list, or retained as a resident if the admissions committee or utilization review committee determines the person meets the criteria in items A to N. A person whose care needs cannot be met must be denied admission or continued stay if the admissions committee or utilization review committee determines the person does not meet the criteria in items A to N.</p>
                  <p>A. The person must have or be assigned to an appropriate bed through the use of a patient classification system.</p>
                  <p>B. The person must have a medical and, if appropriate, psychiatric diagnosis from the attending physician indicating placement in a boarding care facility is a medical necessity.</p>
                  <p>C. The person's attending physician must document the person's need for the services provided in a boarding care facility. If a resident has not specified an attending physician, the attending physician must be a Minnesota veterans homes staff physician. If an applicant for admission has not specified an attending physician, Minnesota veterans homes facility staff must assist the applicant in finding a physician to provide an admitting diagnosis.</p>
                  <p>D. A person must be alert and oriented to person, place, and time, and able to function within a structure of daily monitoring by the nursing staff of the boarding care facility. A person who has a diagnosis of mental illness must be assessed by a staff psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>
                  <p>E. A person must be able to recognize and appropriately react to hazards in the environment. A person who has a diagnosis of mental illness must be assessed by a staff psychiatrist or psychologist. The case mix indicator for orientation and self-preservation skills must be used to determine whether the individual has the mental judgment or physical ability necessary to function in a changing environment and a potentially harmful situation.</p>
                  <p>F. The person has the right to participate in establishing the person's individual care plan. Residents must be advised that exercising their right to refuse care may lead to their discharge if the facility is unable to care for them under part 4655.1500, subpart 2. Continuing cooperation must be measured as specified in the care plan review process in part 9050.0300.</p>
                  <p>G. A person must be physically and mentally capable of providing personal care and hygiene including dressing, grooming, eating, toileting, and washing other than bathing. A person who has a diagnosis of mental illness must be assessed by an attending psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>
                  <p>H. The person must be assessed by a staff registered nurse as independent in transferring and mobility.</p>
                  <p>I. The person must require no more than twice daily face-to-face monitoring by the nursing staff of the boarding care facility. For continued stay, face-to-face monitoring for special medical needs may exceed twice daily for up to five days with approval of the director of nursing or the assistant director of nursing of the boarding care facility.</p>
                  <p>J. An attending psychiatrist or psychologist must assess persons with a history of violent or self-abusive behavior and determine if significant risk factors currently exist which suggest that the individual poses a threat of harm to self or others to determine the facility's ability to meet the safety needs of the person and other persons at the facility.</p>
                  <p>K. A person diagnosed by the attending physician as actively psychotic must require no more than twice daily face-to-face monitoring by facility nursing staff and no more than weekly face-to-face therapeutic contacts with a staff psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>
                  <p>L. A person who has an active substance use disorder must be evaluated by an attending psychologist or psychiatrist. The evaluation must include an assessment of the person's chemical health needs, the current severity of the person's disorder, and whether the facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs can meet the care needs of the person. If the medical records obtained by the admissions committee do not adequately document a person's substance disorder status, the person's status may be verified by a collateral contact. For purposes of this part, "collateral contact" means an oral or written communication initiated by facility staff for the purpose of gathering information from an individual or agency, other than the applicant, to verify or supplement information provided by the applicant. Collateral contact includes contact with family members, criminal justice agencies, educational institutions, and employers.</p>
                  <p>M. The person must be able to comply with Minnesota veterans homes rules in chapter 9050. Ability to comply may be demonstrated by a documented history of compliance in a prior placement, if any, or other relevant evidence that demonstrates ability to comply. Continuing compliance must be measured as specified in the care plan process in part 9050.0300.</p>
                  <p>N. An attending physician shall determine whether the person is free from any communicable disease or infection that poses a threat to the health and safety of others. Exceptions may be made, however, subject to the authority granted by a waiver issued by the Minnesota Department of Health. This subpart complies with Minnesota Statutes, section 144.50, subdivision 7.</p>

                  <p>A resident may be transferred only with the resident's consent or the consent of the legal representative, if any, except in an emergency when obtaining consent before transfer is not possible. A resident who refuses consent for transfer to another health care facility or rehabilitation program or detoxification program on recommendation of the attending physician or the utilization review committee, or both, may be subject to discharge for noncompliance with the resident's individual care plan. The utilization review committee's decision to recommend discharge of a resident for refusing consent for transfer is limited by the Patient's Bill of Rights established in Minnesota Statutes, section 144.651, and must be based on the facility's ability to meet the person's care needs as determined by the criteria in part 9050.0070, subparts 3 and 4.

                  <p>A resident or the resident's legal representative may appeal an administrator's discharge or transfer order. A resident or the resident's legal representative has ten working days after issuance of the administrator's discharge or transfer order to request an administrative appeal.</p>
                  <p>If a resident is voluntarily or involuntarily discharged from a facility while an appeal is pending and fails to notify the administrator in writing as to whether or not the appeal is to continue, the steps in items A to D must be taken.</p>
                  <p>A. The appeal must be placed on hold.</p>
                  <p>B. The administrator shall send the resident a written notice via certified mail to the resident's forwarding address informing the resident that if no written response is received within 30 days of the date of the letter, the appeal must be dismissed. If the resident wishes the appeal to proceed, the resident must notify the administrator in writing.</p>
                  <p>C. If the resident has left no forwarding address, the facility shall document its good faith efforts to attempt to locate the resident.</p>
                  <p>D. If the resident fails to respond to the certified letter or cannot be located despite good faith efforts, the appeal must be dismissed 30 days after the certified letter has been sent or the location efforts were commenced. If the resident notifies the facility of a desire to continue with the appeal, the appeal hearing must be scheduled as soon as feasible for all parties.</p>
                  <p>Appeals must be in accordance with contested case procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act, Minnesota Statutes, section 14.48 et. seq., until rules are adopted under Minnesota Statutes, section 144A.135, by the commissioner of health. Once the rules adopted under Minnesota Statutes, section 144A.135, have taken effect, all appeals must be in accordance with those rules. The administrator shall inform the resident of the rules that govern the appeal in the notice provided under part 9050.0100, subpart 2, or 9050.0200, subpart 4. The final discharge order shall be issued by the commissioner of veterans affairs, after review of the entire record including the recommendations of the administrative law judge. A final discharge order issued by the commissioner of veterans affairs following the Office of Administrative Hearings' review remains in effect pending judicial review under Minnesota Statutes, section 14.63, et. seq. Notwithstanding this provision, the administrator may, for good cause shown, waive imposition of the discharge order until all appeals have been concluded.</p>
                  <p>Nothing in this part may be construed to limit, change, or restrict other appeal or review procedures available to a resident under law.</p>

                <p>A final discharge order is the order issued by the commissioner of veterans affairs following review of the administrator's discharge order under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14, or the discharge order issued by the administrator of a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs if no review was requested. A final discharge order is the final agency decision. When a resident refuses to comply with the terms of a final discharge order issued following review under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14, and the final agency decision, the administrator may seek enforcement of the final discharge order by applying to the district court for an order enforcing the discharge order. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 198.045, the district court may order the sheriff of the county in which the facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs is located to remove the resident from the facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs and authorize the administrator to remove the resident's property and hold it until it can be returned to the former resident. Upon issuance of the court order, the procedures in part 9050.0210 regarding voluntary discharge must be followed, to the extent possible, to effect the discharge.</p>

                  <p>A. Direct costs include the costs of staff care directly attributable to boarding care or nursing home services that directly benefit the resident. An example of a direct cost is nursing service.</p>
                  <p>B. Indirect costs include costs incurred for common or joint purposes that are identified with more than one level of care and are for services that are provided on behalf of a resident of the facility or facilities. Examples are the costs of housekeeping, laundry, administration, and food services. Indirect costs must be reduced by the amount of receipts received by the facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs for lease or rent payments, meals, and other common purpose sources.</p>
                  <p>C. Calculation of the cost of care does not include the expenses of the commissioner of veterans affairs and capital expenditures or revenues, including federal matching funds and designated contributions, and resident fund accounts as specified in parts 4655.4100 to 4655.4170.</p>

The maintenance fee must be recalculated for the period of the resident's stay that coincides with the period for retroactive payment of income to the resident. If the applicant or resident has applied for government benefits and is awarded a retroactive lump sum amount after admission to a facility, but the retroactive lump sum is not received by the resident prior to death or discharge, the maintenance charge must be recalculated for the period of the resident's stay that coincides with the period for retroactive payment of income to the resident.</p>

If real or personal property is not legally available, its equity must not be applied against the limits of subparts 2 and 3. Examples of property not available to a person are an estate that has not been probated, property owned together with one or more other people that the facility financial staff determines cannot be liquidated or reduced to cash through exercise of the applicant's or resident's legal rights, and property of an applicant or resident who is determined incompetent by a court and whose guardianship is pending. The facility financial staff shall consider as available property that property which a person has failed to make available for purposes of gaining admission to a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs or avoiding payment of the maintenance charge. An example of a person's failure to make property available occurs when the person refuses to accept a share of an inheritance.</p>
                  <p>C. Real or personal property transferred by an applicant or resident in violation of part 9050.0650 is presumed legally available.</p>
                  <p>D. The facility financial staff shall consider as available an individual retirement account, Keogh account, or other pension or deferred compensation plan account. The facility financial staff shall evaluate the accounts on the basis of the funds deposited in the account and the interest accrued on the funds less the penalty for early withdrawal.</p>
                  <p>E. The facility financial staff shall consider as available the proceeds that a person receives in a tort settlement, whether the settlement is entered into by the person or the person's guardian. If the settlement is received as a one-time payment, the facility financial staff shall treat it as a lump sum. If the settlement is structured to be paid over a period of time, the facility financial staff shall evaluate the property as those funds become available to the resident. This item applies only to settlements entered into after April 9, 1990.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">2</inline>. <b>Real property limitations.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>Real property owned by an applicant or resident must be excluded from consideration as an available resource, subject to the limitations in items A and B.</p>
                  <p>A. The facility financial staff shall exclude the homestead of an applicant or resident from consideration as a resource according to the provisions in subitems (1) to (4).</p>
                  <p>(1) The spouse of an applicant or resident or the dependent child or children of the applicant or resident, if any, must occupy the homestead.</p>
                  <p>(2) An applicant or resident or spouse of an applicant or resident who is purchasing real property through a contract for deed and using that property as a home is considered the owner of real property.</p>
                  <p>(3) The total amount of land that can be excluded under this subpart is limited as specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 510.02. Additional contiguous platted lots must be assessed as to their legal and actual availability according to subpart 1.</p>
                  <p>(4) When real property that has been used as a home by an applicant or resident, the spouse of an applicant or resident, or the dependent child or children of an applicant or resident is sold, the facility financial staff shall treat the proceeds from that sale as excluded property for a period of two years if the person intends to reinvest them in another home and maintains those proceeds, unused for other purposes, in a separate account. If the property is held jointly, any earnings that accrue on the sales proceeds before reinvestment or any excess proceeds not used for reinvestment must be treated as joint income or property and divided according to subpart 1, item A.</p>
                  <p>B. Real property being sold on a contract for deed must be excluded if the net present value of the contract in combination with other property does not exceed the limitations in parts 9050.0560 and 9050.0600. If the present value exceeds limitations, the contract payments must be considered as income to the applicant or resident. If the contract is sold, proceeds from the sale must be treated as lump sum payments.</p>
                  <p>C. Real property that is rental property leased at a market rent and producing a net income must be excluded. If the property is sold, the proceeds must be treated as lump sum payments.</p>
                  <p>D. Real property on or in which the person operates a business that is anticipated to produce a net income must be excluded. If the property is sold, the proceeds must be treated as lump sum payments.</p>
                  <p>E. Real property that is not salable must be excluded. If the property is an asset that must be liquidated for the resident or applicant to meet the financial needs established by the maintenance charge calculations, the property must be sold within six months of the determination of financial need or within six months of the date of initial admission, whichever is later, unless the property is not salable. For purposes of this item, "not salable" means:</p>
                  <p>(1) two neutral licensed professionals agree that the property is not salable due to a specified condition; if the nonsalable condition is due to an action taken by the applicant or resident within the 12 months prior to the initial admission, there is a presumption that the action was an improper transfer pursuant to part 9050.0650, subpart 3, and is subject to the considerations listed in that subpart; or</p>
                  <p>(2) an actual good faith sale attempt was made at a price not more than an estimate of the highest current market value obtained within six months of application for admission or since the last determination of the maintenance charge, but no offer to purchase was received. The market value price estimate must be based upon the written estimates from two licensed real estate professionals. If a purchase offer at the lowest professional market value price estimate was received but was rejected by the seller, it is presumed that the failure to sell the property was due to an improper action on the part of the seller. The lowest market price estimate must be the figure taken into account in determining the resident's maintenance charge or the spousal allowance.</p>
                  <p>For purposes of subitems (1) and (2), the source of information must be from the same geographic area as the property and knowledgeable about the value of the type of property offered for sale. For purposes of subitem (2), "an actual sale attempt" means the individual has listed the property with a licensed real estate broker or salesperson or, if the property is offered for sale by the owner, the owner has affixed to the property a prominently posted, conspicuous sign that is readable from the road or driveway entrance. The sign must include in large, legible type a notice of the sale and the address or phone number of the owner. The owner must prominently advertise the property for sale in the official newspaper of the county, the newspaper of largest circulation in the county, or the local shopper. The minimum period of an actual sale attempt is 90 consecutive days. If a property has been determined to be nonsalable, the owner of the property must offer it for sale again or establish it is still nonsalable within two years after the date of the last determination of nonsalability.</p>
                  <p>F. Other real property must be excluded if required by federal law, federal regulations, or state law.</p>

                  <p>B. the value of a prepaid burial account, burial plan, burial contract, or burial trust up to an amount set by the commissioner of veterans affairs or the entire amount of an investment made prior to the date of initial admission, whichever is greater. The commissioner of veterans affairs shall establish and annually review the items categorized under "burial account," "burial plan," "burial contract," and "burial trust" and establish maximum value allowance limits on those items. The allowance set by the commissioner of veterans affairs for total burial and funeral costs must not be below $5,000;</p>

                  <p>A person whose application for admission is pending or a current resident of a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs shall declare all transfers or sales of property within ten days of the transfer or sale. The value of property transferred or sold must be treated as an available resource for payment of the resident's maintenance charge. The value of the property transferred or sold that will be applied against the property limits in parts 9050.0560 and 9050.0600 is the market value of the property at the time of the sale or transfer less any encumbrances on the property. A transfer for purposes of preserving an estate for heirs is the same as a transfer for the purposes of establishing eligibility for admission to a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs or avoiding payment of a maintenance charge, except for transfers permitted under subpart 2, item B.</p>

                  <p>A transfer or sale of property for less than market value within 12 months before admission or during the resident's stay in a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs, unless permitted under subpart 2, is presumed to be for the purpose of establishing or maintaining eligibility for admission to or continued residence in a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs or to avoid payment of the maintenance charge, unless the person furnishes convincing evidence to show that the transfer was for another purpose. Convincing evidence must include evidence that the person had no health or economic reasons to believe that nursing home or boarding care would be needed. Upon discovery of an incorrect transfer, a retroactive adjustment must be made in the maintenance charge assessed to the resident. If the property that was incorrectly transferred was in the resident's name, the maintenance charge must be increased to the full cost of care until the facility has been paid the value of the property that was incorrectly transferred in addition to the maintenance charge that would have otherwise been received. If the property that was incorrectly transferred was in the spouse's name only, the spousal allowance must be eliminated for the number of months which, when multiplied by the amount of the spousal allowance that would have been granted but for the incorrect transfer, equals the value of the property that was incorrectly transferred.</p>
                  <p>If a resident's maintenance charge or a spousal allowance is adjusted because of a transfer for less than fair market value, the resident, spouse, dependent, or their legal representative may request from the administrator a waiver if the adjusted maintenance charge or spousal allowance will cause undue hardship resulting in an imminent threat to the individual's health or well-being. In evaluating a request for a waiver, the administrator shall take into account whether the individual was the victim of financial exploitation, whether the individual has made reasonable efforts to recover the transferred property or resource, and other factors relevant to a determination of hardship. If the administrator does not approve a waiver, the administrator shall issue a written notice to the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the decision. The decision may be appealed to the commissioner of veterans affairs. An appeal to the commissioner of veterans affairs must be handled in the same manner as a hearing under part 9050.0580.</p>

                  <p>An applicant or resident who lends property or on whose behalf property is loaned is considered to have transferred the property. The facility financial staff shall evaluate the transaction as a transfer of property under subparts 1 and 2. If the person receives adequate compensation for the loan or made the loan more than 12 months before the person's entrance into a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs, the facility financial staff shall honor the loan. Adequate compensation must be shown by a written loan agreement and receipt of payments according to the schedule in the agreement. If the loan is payable on demand, is due, or is otherwise negotiable, the property is presumed to be available to the applicant or resident. This presumption may be overcome by convincing evidence presented by the person that the loan will not be repaid. Interest payments made by the borrower to the person are considered income in the month received and an asset if retained. Principal payments made by the borrower to the person are considered as assets.</p>

For purposes of this subpart, "services" means labor performed by one person for another person or entity. Goods are not considered compensation unless supported by contemporaneous receipts or other evidence of expenditure. The purchase of paid up life insurance with no cash surrender value available to the person while the person is a resident or within 12 months before admission must be considered a transfer of an asset without acceptable compensation.</p>

Trusts established other than by will by the person or the person's spouse under which the person may be the beneficiary of all or part of the payments from the trust and the distribution of the payments are determined by one or more trustees who may exercise discretion about the distribution to the person must be considered an available resource. This item applies regardless of whether the trust is irrevocable or is established for purposes other than to enable a person to qualify for admission to a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs or whether the discretion of the trustees is exercised. A trust fund established by the applicant or resident on behalf of another person within 12 months before admission or during the resident's stay in a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs must be considered transferred property under part 9050.0650.</p>

                  <p>The commissioner of veterans affairs shall establish and annually review the items categorized under "basic needs" and "personal needs" and allowance limits on categories of expenses covered within those definitions. The commissioner of veterans affairs shall revise the allowances as necessary to reflect a reasonable sum for the average person. If the commissioner of veterans affairs does not take action to review the allowance, the allowance must be adjusted by multiplying it by the percentage of change of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the first day of each calendar year. The initial recommendations presented to the commissioner of veterans affairs must be based upon a review of the actual allowances currently being used at each home, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or a combination of the two. Future recommendations must be based upon the current allowances, requests for increased allowances that have been received by the homes, and data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
                  <p>If a spouse believes that an allowance as based upon the allowance limits is insufficient to meet the spouse's needs, the spouse or a legal representative may submit a written request to the administrator for a waiver. The decision to grant or deny a waiver must be based on assets, income, or expense information provided under subpart 1a. The reasons for granting or denying the waiver must be put in writing and delivered to the spouse or the legal representative. If the waiver is granted, the administrator shall indicate the amount of the revised spousal allowance and the duration of the waiver. No waiver may be granted for more than one calendar year. A spouse may apply for an additional waiver upon the expiration of an existing waiver.</p>

Allowances for education of the child beyond high school or the equivalent of high school must not be considered. Student loans must not be considered as an allowance expense.

                  <p>If an applicant or resident, or the spouse of an applicant or resident, requests a deduction from the applicant's or resident's gross monthly income for support of a dependent spouse or household, the facility financial staff shall verify the available resources of the dependent spouse or household. All resources listed in subpart 2a must be excluded for the purposes of determining availability of resources. If the facility financial staff has verified that the dependent spouse or household has no resources available other than excluded resources, a deduction from the applicant's or resident's gross monthly income must be calculated according to subpart 3.</p>
                  <p>Available resources must be calculated to include assets belonging to the spouse as of 12 months before the date of admission. Asset transfers to the applicant are permissible. Any action by a spouse within the 12 months before the initial admission for residency that defers income from an asset, limits the liquid value of an asset, or makes an asset unusable is presumed to be improper. If property or resources have been incorrectly transferred, the spousal allowance will be adjusted in accordance with part 9050.0650, subpart 3. Any asset transfer or sales after the date of initial admission by a spouse to anyone other than the resident is an incorrect transfer and part 9050.0650, subpart 3 applies, unless the proceeds of the transfer or sale are used by the spouse or dependent for normal living expenses.</p>
                  <p>If a maintenance charge or a spousal allowance is adjusted because of an incorrect transfer, the resident, spouse, or dependent or their legal representative may request from the administrator a waiver if the adjusted maintenance charge or spousal allowance will cause undue hardship resulting in an imminent threat to the individual's health and well-being. In evaluating a waiver, the administrator shall take into account whether the individual was a victim of financial exploitation, whether the individual has made reasonable efforts to recover the transferred property or resource, and other factors relevant to a determination of hardship. If the administrator does not approve a waiver, the administrator shall issue a written notice to the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the decision. The decision may be appealed to the commissioner of veterans affairs. An appeal to the commissioner of veterans affairs must be handled in the same manner as a hearing under part 9050.0580.</p>

                  <p>A. calculate the spouse's gross monthly income using the method for calculation of the applicant's or resident's gross income in part 9050.0710, then subtract the following deductible items:</p>

                  <p>(4) voluntary retirement fund payments. The payment amounts must not exceed the average of the monthly sums paid by the spouse during the 12 to 24 months prior to the resident's initial admission;</p>
                  <p>(5) actual reasonable unreimbursed expenses of child care necessary to earn an income and paid to anyone other than a parent of the child;</p>

                <p>Income must be anticipated on a semiannual basis for all applicants or residents. Anticipated income must be determined using the method in items A to G that most accurately reflects the circumstances of the person.</p>
                <p>A. If income is unvarying in amount and timing of receipt, an eligibility statement or wage stub must be used to verify the amount of the income. Examples of unvarying income are social security payments, pensions, unemployment compensation, and fixed salaries. For purposes of this item, "eligibility statement" means a document from a payer informing the person of eligibility for the amount of income.</p>
                <p>B. Income that is expected to fluctuate slightly must be anticipated by using the income in the month of admission or redetermination. Monthly income must be calculated by multiplying:</p>
                <p>(1) average weekly income by 4.3;</p>
                <p>(2) average biweekly income by 2.16; or</p>
                <p>(3) average semimonthly income by 2.</p>
                <p>C. If income is expected to fluctuate but does not follow a seasonal pattern, monthly income is the average of monthly income received during the three most recent months.</p>
                <p>D. If income fluctuates within a seasonal pattern but is reasonably stable from year to year, monthly income is the average of monthly income during the most recently completed calendar year.</p>
                <p>E. Except as provided in item G, monthly farm income is the average of monthly income for the three most recent years during which the farm has been in operation.</p>
                <p>F. Zero income must be used for any month in which no source of income is reasonably certain.</p>
                <p>G. If the applicant or resident has had a recent financial change that makes a method in item C, D, or E an inaccurate predictor of future income, the facility financial staff shall make a reasonable estimate of future income and document the income basis used.</p>
