The active waiting list is for applicants desiring the first available bed at the level of care appropriate to the applicant's needs. The inactive waiting list is for those applicants who do not currently want to exercise their option for admission, or who have not yet met the established criteria for admission.</p>
      <p>If an eligible applicant cannot be considered for admission to a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs with an appropriate level of care due to unavailability of a bed, the applicant must be placed on either an active or inactive waiting list according to preference. An applicant shall indicate preference for the active or inactive waiting list on the application form. As part of the preadmission screening, the applicant's indicated preference for the waiting lists must be reviewed and amended if appropriate. An applicant may request movement from one waiting list to another at any time, unless the request is precluded by subpart 5. An applicant requesting movement from one waiting list to another must be placed at the bottom of the waiting list to which movement was requested. The applicant's position on the waiting list is determined by the date on which the application form is received.</p>

A person on the active waiting list must be considered for admission and, if approved by the admissions committee, offered a bed consistent with the person's position on the active waiting list and the patient classification system and level of care needs as determined by the admissions committee. A person offered admission has three working days to consider the offer. If the person declines the offer of admission, the person's name must be put on the bottom of the active waiting list, unless the person requests removal from the active waiting list or transfer to the inactive waiting list. If the person fails to respond to the offer of admission within three working days from the date the offer is made, the person's application file must be closed and the person's name removed from all waiting lists. A person whose name is removed from all waiting lists for failure to respond to an offer for admission must reapply.</p>
      <p>A bed must be held without charge for an approved applicant for up to three working days from the date of acceptance of the offer of admission. The bed may be held open for an additional period of time at the discretion of the administrator. A bed held under this subpart is a reserved bed.</p>

    <p>A final discharge order is the order issued by the commissioner of veterans affairs following review of the administrator's discharge order under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14, or the discharge order issued by the administrator of a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs if no review was requested. A final discharge order is the final agency decision. When a resident refuses to comply with the terms of a final discharge order issued following review under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14, and the final agency decision, the administrator may seek enforcement of the final discharge order by applying to the district court for an order enforcing the discharge order. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section <a href="/statutes/cite/198.045">198.045</a>, the district court may order the sheriff of the county in which the facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs is located to remove the resident from the facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs and authorize the administrator to remove the resident's property and hold it until it can be returned to the former resident. Upon issuance of the court order, the procedures in part <a href="/rules/9050.0210">9050.0210</a> regarding voluntary discharge must be followed, to the extent possible, to effect the discharge.</p>

Residents not paying the maximum maintenance fee who receive retroactive increases in income must have their maintenance fee recalculated and the part of the increase owed to the home must be paid. The maintenance fee must be recalculated for the period of the resident's stay that coincides with the period for retroactive payment of income to the resident. If the applicant or resident has applied for government benefits and is awarded a retroactive lump sum amount after admission to a facility, but the retroactive lump sum is not received by the resident prior to death or discharge, the maintenance charge must be recalculated for the period of the resident's stay that coincides with the period for retroactive payment of income to the resident.</p>

          <p> two neutral licensed professionals agree that the property is not salable due to a specified condition; if the nonsalable condition is due to an action taken by the applicant or resident within the 12 months prior to the initial admission, there is a presumption that the action was an improper transfer pursuant to part <a href="/rules/9050.0650">9050.0650</a>, subpart 3, and is subject to the considerations listed in that subpart; or</p>

          <p> an actual good faith sale attempt was made at a price not more than an estimate of the highest current market value obtained within six months of application for admission or since the last determination of the maintenance charge, but no offer to purchase was received. The market value price estimate must be based upon the written estimates from two licensed real estate professionals. If a purchase offer at the lowest professional market value price estimate was received but was rejected by the seller, it is presumed that the failure to sell the property was due to an improper action on the part of the seller. The lowest market price estimate must be the figure taken into account in determining the resident's maintenance charge or the spousal allowance.</p>
          <p>For purposes of subitems (1) and (2), the source of information must be from the same geographic area as the property and knowledgeable about the value of the type of property offered for sale. For purposes of subitem (2), "an actual sale attempt" means the individual has listed the property with a licensed real estate broker or salesperson or, if the property is offered for sale by the owner, the owner has affixed to the property a prominently posted, conspicuous sign that is readable from the road or driveway entrance. The sign must include in large, legible type a notice of the sale and the address or phone number of the owner. The owner must prominently advertise the property for sale in the official newspaper of the county, the newspaper of largest circulation in the county, or the local shopper. The minimum period of an actual sale attempt is 90 consecutive days. If a property has been determined to be nonsalable, the owner of the property must offer it for sale again or establish it is still nonsalable within two years after the date of the last determination of nonsalability.</p>

      <p>A person whose application for admission is pending or a current resident of a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs shall declare all transfers or sales of property within ten days of the transfer or sale. The value of property transferred or sold must be treated as an available resource for payment of the resident's maintenance charge.

      <h2 class="headnote">Incorrect transfers. </h2>
      <p>A transfer or sale of property for less than market value within 12 months before admission or during the resident's stay in a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs, unless permitted under subpart 2, is presumed to be for the purpose of establishing or maintaining eligibility for admission to or continued residence in a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs or to avoid payment of the maintenance charge, unless the person furnishes convincing evidence to show that the transfer was for another purpose. Convincing evidence must include evidence that the person had no health or economic reasons to believe that nursing home or boarding care would be needed. Upon discovery of an incorrect transfer, a retroactive adjustment must be made in the maintenance charge assessed to the resident. If the property that was incorrectly transferred was in the resident's name, the maintenance charge must be increased to the full cost of care until the facility has been paid the value of the property that was incorrectly transferred in addition to the maintenance charge that would have otherwise been received. If the property that was incorrectly transferred was in the spouse's name only, the spousal allowance must be eliminated for the number of months which, when multiplied by the amount of the spousal allowance that would have been granted but for the incorrect transfer, equals the value of the property that was incorrectly transferred.</p>
      <p>If a resident's maintenance charge or a spousal allowance is adjusted because of a transfer for less than fair market value, the resident, spouse, dependent, or their legal representative may request from the administrator a waiver if the adjusted maintenance charge or spousal allowance will cause undue hardship resulting in an imminent threat to the individual's health or well-being. In evaluating a request for a waiver, the administrator shall take into account whether the individual was the victim of financial exploitation, whether the individual has made reasonable efforts to recover the transferred property or resource, and other factors relevant to a determination of hardship. If the administrator does not approve a waiver, the administrator shall issue a written notice to the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the decision. The decision may be appealed to the commissioner of veterans affairs. An appeal to the commissioner of veterans affairs must be handled in the same manner as a hearing under part <a href="/rules/9050.0580">9050.0580</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="headnote">Loans of property. </h2>
      <p>An applicant or resident who lends property or on whose behalf property is loaned is considered to have transferred the property. The facility financial staff shall evaluate the transaction as a transfer of property under subparts 1 and 2. If the person receives adequate compensation for the loan or made the loan more than 12 months before the person's entrance into a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs, the facility financial staff shall honor the loan. Adequate compensation must be shown by a written loan agreement and receipt of payments according to the schedule in the agreement. If the loan is payable on demand, is due, or is otherwise negotiable, the property is presumed to be available to the applicant or resident. This presumption may be overcome by convincing evidence presented by the person that the loan will not be repaid. Interest payments made by the borrower to the person are considered income in the month received and an asset if retained. Principal payments made by the borrower to the person are considered as assets.</p>

Goods are not considered compensation unless supported by contemporaneous receipts or other evidence of expenditure. The purchase of paid up life insurance with no cash surrender value available to the person while the person is a resident or within 12 months before admission must be considered a transfer of an asset without acceptable compensation.</p>

Trusts established other than by will by the person or the person's spouse under which the person may be the beneficiary of all or part of the payments from the trust and the distribution of the payments are determined by one or more trustees who may exercise discretion about the distribution to the person must be considered an available resource. This item applies regardless of whether the trust is irrevocable or is established for purposes other than to enable a person to qualify for admission to a facility operated by the commissioner of veterans affairs or whether the discretion of the trustees is exercised.

      <h2 class="headnote">Application of dependent spouse's or household's available resources. </h2>
      <p>If an applicant or resident, or the spouse of an applicant or resident, requests a deduction from the applicant's or resident's gross monthly income for support of a dependent spouse or household, the facility financial staff shall verify the available resources of the dependent spouse or household. All resources listed in subpart 2a must be excluded for the purposes of determining availability of resources. If the facility financial staff has verified that the dependent spouse or household has no resources available other than excluded resources, a deduction from the applicant's or resident's gross monthly income must be calculated according to subpart 3.</p>
      <p>Available resources must be calculated to include assets belonging to the spouse as of 12 months before the date of admission. Asset transfers to the applicant are permissible. Any action by a spouse within the 12 months before the initial admission for residency that defers income from an asset, limits the liquid value of an asset, or makes an asset unusable is presumed to be improper. If property or resources have been incorrectly transferred, the spousal allowance will be adjusted in accordance with part <a href="/rules/9050.0650">9050.0650</a>, subpart 3. Any asset transfer or sales after the date of initial admission by a spouse to anyone other than the resident is an incorrect transfer and part <a href="/rules/9050.0650">9050.0650</a>, subpart 3 applies, unless the proceeds of the transfer or sale are used by the spouse or dependent for normal living expenses.</p>
      <p>If a maintenance charge or a spousal allowance is adjusted because of an incorrect transfer, the resident, spouse, or dependent or their legal representative may request from the administrator a waiver if the adjusted maintenance charge or spousal allowance will cause undue hardship resulting in an imminent threat to the individual's health and well-being. In evaluating a waiver, the administrator shall take into account whether the individual was a victim of financial exploitation, whether the individual has made reasonable efforts to recover the transferred property or resource, and other factors relevant to a determination of hardship. If the administrator does not approve a waiver, the administrator shall issue a written notice to the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the decision. The decision may be appealed to the commissioner of veterans affairs. An appeal to the commissioner of veterans affairs must be handled in the same manner as a hearing under part <a href="/rules/9050.0580">9050.0580</a>.</p>
