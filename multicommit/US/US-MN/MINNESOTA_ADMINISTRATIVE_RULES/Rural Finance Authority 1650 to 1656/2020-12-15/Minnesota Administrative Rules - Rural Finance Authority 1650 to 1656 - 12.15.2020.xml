                  <p>A. The authority shall make unsecured loans to eligible borrowers for eligible purposes under a loan agreement between the authority as lender and the eligible borrower as borrower. The loans must be evidenced by promissory notes payable to the authority or its assigns.</p>
                  <p>B. A loan may not be made that violates any of the restrictions in subitems (1) to (6).</p>
                  <p>(1) A loan may not exceed loan amount limitations set forth in United States Code, title 26, sections 144 and 147(c).</p>
                  <p>(2) Ninety-five percent of the loan proceeds in excess of loan transaction costs must be expended for an eligible purpose, and not more than two percent of the loan proceeds may be used to pay loan transaction costs.</p>
                  <p>(3) The maturity of a loan or portion of a loan made to finance improvements or depreciable agricultural property may not exceed 120 percent of the useful life of the improvements or depreciable agricultural property under the code.</p>
                  <p>(4) Not more than five percent of the loan proceeds in excess of loan transaction costs may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, or to finance the purchase or improvement of a residence or working capital or inventory such as seed, fertilizer, or feeder livestock. Use of loan proceeds for reimbursement of costs incurred prior to the adoption by the authority of a preliminary resolution approving a loan and the issuance of a bond to fund it as described in part 1650.0551 or money borrowed to pay such costs constitutes use of loan proceeds for working capital or refinancing.</p>
                  <p>(5) All loan proceeds must be expended within six months of the loan closing.</p>
                  <p>(6) The acquisition by a first time farmer of land or personal property from a related person must be for the fair market value of the land or property, after which the related person must have no financial interest in the farming operation with respect to which the bond proceeds are to be used.</p>
                  <p>C. The authority shall issue a bond to provide money to fund each loan. The authority has no other money available for this purpose. The bond must be issued to the eligible lender who has agreed with the eligible borrower to finance the eligible borrower's loan by jointly submitting a loan application according to part 1650.0541. The bond must be issued in fully registered form under a loan agreement between the lender and the authority.</p>
                  <p>D. The bond must be a special, limited obligation of the authority payable solely from loan payments payable by the eligible borrower under the borrower's loan agreement and the promissory note evidencing the loan, that must be assigned to the lender and pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the bond, without recourse to the authority. The bond must not be a general obligation of the authority, the state of Minnesota, or any department, agency, or political subdivision of the state. The full faith and credit of the authority or the state or any department, agency, or political subdivision of the state must not be pledged for the bond's payment.</p>
                  <p>E. A bond may be additionally secured by a mortgage on or security interest in the property financed or other property provided by the borrower, or by personal guaranties made by the borrower or another individual. All agreements and documents providing or evidencing additional security must be entered into between the borrower or another individual and the lender. The authority may not be a party to the agreement or document and is not responsible in any way with respect to the authorization, execution, effectiveness, or adequacy of the additional security.</p>

                  <p>A. The authority must try to issue each bond as a "qualified small issue bond" within the meaning of section 144(a) of the code. Interest payable on a qualified small issue bond is not includable in gross income of the recipient for federal income tax purposes, or in net income of individuals, estates, or trusts for Minnesota income tax purposes. At the loan closing, the authority shall furnish to the lender an opinion of an attorney or firm of attorneys nationally recognized as bond counsel as to the validity of the bond and the tax exempt nature of the interest payable on the bond, addressed to the lender. The form of that opinion is available upon request to the authority by any eligible lender joining in a loan application.</p>
                  <p>B. The lender may not rely upon information provided by the authority as to state and federal tax matters, but may rely only upon representations, warranties, or covenants made by the authority in the loan documents and the legal opinion.</p>
                  <p>C. The lender is responsible to determine the applicability and effect of other state and federal laws on the lender's income, deductions, or tax status for state and federal tax purposes as a result of the purchase of a bond.</p>

                  <p>A. All applications under the program must be in forms provided by the RFA. A lender and an applicant must jointly complete and sign an application and prepare all supporting documents identified in the application. Financial statements must be dated within 120 days of the application.</p>
                  <p>B. The applicant shall not begin acquisition or construction of any part of the agricultural improvements before RFA approval of the application. Upon notice to the lender of approval by the RFA, the applicant may move forward with acquisition or construction of the agricultural improvements.</p>
                  <p>C. The lender shall complete the initial review of the proposal and determine the creditworthiness of the applicant and the value of the collateral to be used to secure the loan. If the lender agrees to make a mortgage loan to the applicant, the lender and the applicant shall jointly prepare the application and the required loan documents.</p>
                  <p>D. The lender, as the originator of the mortgage loan, shall present the application and loan documents to the RFA. Presentation of the documents constitutes an offer to sell a participation interest in the loan.</p>
                  <p>E. The nonrefundable application fee as established in Minnesota Statutes, section 41B.043, subdivision 3, must be submitted with the application.</p>
                  <p>F. The loan must be for a maximum term of ten years. The maximum participation is the amount established in Minnesota Statutes, section 41B.043, subdivision 1b.</p>
                  <p>G. The RFA is restricted to participation in loans that do not exceed 80 percent of the appraised value of the real estate offered for collateral. Additional collateral may be required based on the depreciability and saleability of the collateral and creditworthiness of the applicant.</p>
                  <p>H. If a change occurs in the information provided by the lender to the RFA, the lender shall immediately update and correct that information. Misrepresentation in the application or failure to update any required information is grounds to reject an application, revoke a notice of approval, or refuse to close the loan.</p>

                  <p>(1) the applicant meets all eligibility criteria of parts 1650.0601 to 1650.0661 and Minnesota Statutes, section 41B.043, subdivision 1a or 1b;</p>
                  <p>(2) the applicant demonstrates an ability to repay the mortgage loan and other obligations based on the financial information submitted with the application;</p>
                  <p>(3) the proposed agricultural improvements meet specifications set by statute and rule; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the RFA has sufficient funds available to purchase a participation in the loan.</p>
                  <p>C. The RFA shall promptly notify the lender in writing whether or not the offer is accepted. If the offer is not accepted, the notice must state the reasons.</p>
                  <p>D. If an offer is rejected, either the lender or the applicant may petition for RFA reconsideration. The petition must be in writing and must be sent within 30 days of the date of the RFA notice. The petition must state the grounds for the appeal, and may include additional relevant information. Within 15 working days of receiving the petition, the executive director shall send a written response to the petitioner upholding or reversing the original decision and giving the reasons for the decision.</p>
                  <p>E. After administrative appeal, a petitioner may appeal the executive director decision directly to the RFA board by written notice to the director within 15 days of receiving the director's reconsideration decision. The decision of the board is final.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of the RFA seller-sponsored loan participation program and for the issuance of bonds to finance or provide security for the program is to preserve and develop the state's agricultural resources. This is accomplished by extending credit on real estate security through the purchase of participation interests in first priority mortgage farm real estate loans. Loans to persons entering or reentering farming and meeting the eligibility criteria in this chapter are eligible for participation. Under this program, the eligible seller of a farm must partially finance the sale of the farm through a loan to an eligible borrower. An eligible lender and the state, acting through the RFA, shall jointly provide the remainder of the financing needed by the borrower.</p>

                  <p>A. The authority shall make loans to eligible borrowers for eligible purposes pursuant to a loan agreement between the authority as lender and the eligible borrower as borrower. The loans must be evidenced by promissory notes payable to the authority or its assigns, and except as provided in item E must be unsecured.</p>
                  <p>B. A loan may not be made if it violates any of the restrictions in subitems (1) to (6).</p>
                  <p>(1) The amount of a loan, together with the amount of any similar loan made to the same borrower or a related person or entity, may not exceed $250,000.</p>
                  <p>(2) Ninety-five percent of the loan proceeds must be expended for an eligible purpose, and not more than two percent of the loan proceeds may be used to pay loan transaction costs.</p>
                  <p>(3) The maturity of a loan or portion of a loan made to finance improvements or depreciable property to be used in an agricultural business enterprise may not exceed 120 percent of the useful life of the improvements or property under the code.</p>
                  <p>(4) Not more than five percent of the loan proceeds may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, or to finance the purchase or improvement of a residence or working capital or inventory. Use of loan proceeds for reimbursement of costs incurred before adoption by the authority of a preliminary resolution approving a loan and the issuance of a bond to fund it as described in part 1652.0060 or money borrowed to pay such costs constitutes use of loan proceeds for working capital or refinancing.</p>
                  <p>(5) All loan proceeds must be expended within six months of the loan closing or the first date on which loan proceeds are disbursed, whichever is later, or all proceeds must be expended within 18 months of the loan closing or the first date on which loan proceeds are disbursed, whichever is later, in which event the borrower must furnish to the authority all information as to the investment of loan proceeds and any money required to be rebated to the United States under section 148 of the code.</p>
                  <p>(6) Loan proceeds may not be used to finance the purchase of land, improvements, or depreciable property from a related person or entity.</p>
                  <p>C. The authority shall issue a bond to provide money to fund each loan. The authority has no other money available for this purpose. The bond must be issued to the eligible lender who has agreed with the eligible borrower to finance the eligible borrower's loan by jointly submitting a loan application in accordance with part 1652.0050. The bond must be issued in fully registered form pursuant to a loan agreement between the lender and the authority.</p>
                  <p>D. The bond must be a special, limited obligation of the authority payable solely from loan payments payable by the eligible borrower under the borrower's loan agreement and the promissory note evidencing the loan, which will be assigned to the lender and pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on the bond, without recourse to the authority. The bond must not be a general obligation of the authority, the state of Minnesota, or any department, agency, or political subdivision of the state, and the full faith and credit of the authority, the state, or any department, agency, or political subdivision of the state must not be pledged for its payment.</p>
                  <p>E. A bond may be additionally secured by a mortgage on or security interest in the property financed or other property provided by the borrower, or by personal guaranties made by the borrower or another individual. All agreements and documents providing or evidencing such additional security must be entered into between the borrower or another individual and the lender. The authority may not be a party to the agreement or document and may not be responsible in any way with respect to the authorization, execution, effectiveness, or adequacy of the additional security.</p>

                  <p>B. Upon a lender's demonstration of its ability to originate and service commercial real estate and equipment loans, the authority shall designate them as an approved lender for purposes of the ethanol production facility loan program.</p>
                  <p>C. Before offering loans to the authority for participation, each approved lender must enter into a master participation agreement. The agreement shall specify the contractual relationship between the parties and terms and conditions of loans to be made by the lender under the ethanol production facility loan program and offered to the authority for participation.</p>

The lender must record and cross-reference all documents relating to the loan including the authority note and loan agreement. The lender must notify the authority that the loan is closed and recorded and submit copies of the recorded documents to the authority.</p>
                  <p>B. Within ten business days of receipt of written notice under item A, that the loan is closed and recorded, the authority shall pay the lender the authority's participation interest in the loan.</p>
                  <p>C. Within five working days after the receipt of finally collected funds, the lender shall complete and return a participation certificate as prescribed by the authority evidencing the authority's undivided pro rata interest in the ethanol production facility loan.</p>

                  <p>C. A lender must repurchase the authority's participation interest if the lender has made misrepresentations or fails to perform its obligations under the participation agreement, has received written notice from the authority, and has not corrected the representation of performance under the notice.</p>
                  <p>D. Any repurchase shall be for the principal balance of the authority's participation plus accrued interest and any penalties or costs incurred by the authority to secure repurchase.</p>
