                  <p>A. The application must be signed by the land occupier and the landowner, if different, indicating their agreement to:</p>
                  <p>(1) grant the district's representatives access to the parcel where the conservation practice will be located;</p>
                  <p>(2) obtain all permits required in conjunction with the installation and establishment of the practice prior to starting construction of the practice; and</p>
                  <p>(3) be responsible for operation and maintenance of conservation practices applied under this program according to an operation and maintenance plan prepared or approved by a district technical representative or the district's delegate.</p>
                  <p>B. Costs to repair damage to conservation practices installed with state cost-share dollars are eligible if the damage was caused by reasons beyond the control of the land occupier.</p>
                  <p>C. If the practice has fully met or exceeded its designed effective life, the cost to reconstruct the practice is eligible for cost-share assistance.</p>
                  <p>D. Conservation practices where construction has begun prior to district approval are ineligible for financial assistance. The board may waive this requirement for emergency needs.</p>

                <p>Minnesota Statutes, sections 84.95, 103A.209, and 103F.501 to 103F.531, authorize the state board, in consultation with districts, private groups, and state and federal agencies, to implement a program to acquire easements on land to retire certain marginal agricultural land and protect environmentally sensitive areas to enhance soil and water quality, minimize damage to flood-prone areas, sequester carbon, and support native plant, fish, and wildlife habitats and to reestablish perennial cover and restore wetlands on that land. Parts 8400.3000 to 8400.3930 provide procedures and criteria to be followed by the state board and district boards in implementing Minnesota Statutes, sections 103F.501 to 103F.531. The state board shall implement the reinvest in Minnesota reserve program with district boards when practical, but may also implement the program directly.</p>

                <p>A. When a conservation easement of limited duration expires, a new conservation agreement and conservation easement for an additional period of not less than 20 years may be acquired by agreement of the state board and the landowner under the rules in force at that time. The state board may adjust payment rates as a result of renewing a conservation agreement and conservation easement after examining the condition of the established cover, conservation practices, and land values.</p>
                <p>B. The easement duration may be lengthened through mutual agreement of the current landowner with the state board, in consultation with the commissioners of agriculture and natural resources, if the state board determines that the changes are consistent with the purpose of the conservation easement program. When converting limited duration easements to permanent easements, the payment is the difference between the amount that would be paid per acre for the permanent easement as established for the most recent sign-up period and the amount already paid for the limited duration easement on the area.</p>

                  <p>A. Upon satisfactory performance under part 8400.3630, subpart 2, the landowner shall present receipts or invoices to the district board, or its delegate, of the costs incurred in the installation of the cost-shared practice. The district board shall review the receipts or invoices to determine the costs eligible for conservation easement program payment. If the district board determines that the costs requested for reimbursement are reasonable and necessary, it shall recommend payment to the landowner by submitting certification of satisfactory performance and providing documentation of reimbursable practice costs to the state board on forms provided by the state board. If the district board determines that certain costs requested for reimbursement are not eligible or reasonable, it shall notify the landowner in writing of this determination. The landowner may request reconsideration of this determination by the district board within 30 days of receipt of the determination. If additional costs are determined to be eligible and reasonable, the district board shall then recommend payment for the approved amount. The state board reserves the right to approve whether costs requested for reimbursement are eligible and reasonable.</p>

                  <p>A landowner is not in violation of the conservation easement if the failure, in whole or part, of a cost-shared practice was caused by reasons beyond the landowner's control such as extreme weather conditions. In these instances, the district board may recommend to the state board that conservation easement program cost-sharing funds be encumbered for reestablishment of the cost-shared practice. The encumbrance must comply with the limits prescribed by the state board. In no case may a district board authorize conservation easement program financial assistance to a landowner for the reestablishment of cost-shared practices that were removed or altered by the landowner, or that have failed due to improper maintenance during the term of the conservation easement.</p>

                  <p>"Conservation practice" means a practice containing a definition, purpose, conditions under which the practice is applied including design requirements, and specifications containing a statement of details required for installing a conservation practice, including necessary kinds, quality, and quantity of work and materials. A conservation practice may be a permanent or temporary, vegetative or structural measure that, when applied to the land, will contribute to the control of wind and water erosion and sedimentation. "Conservation practices" may be used in a development activity area or an agricultural area. Permanent practices are those that have an effective life of ten years or more and include grassed waterways, terraces, field windbreaks, water control structures, grade stabilization structures, sediment retention structures, strip-cropping, water and sediment control basins, and other permanent practices approved by the board. Temporary practices include conservation tillage, contour farming, grasses and legumes in rotation, emergency tillage, fabric filter barriers, filter strips, storm water inlet and outlet protection, and any other cultural practices approved by the board. The field office technical guide or other recognized technical procedures must be used to design, install, and certify practices.</p>

Upon request of a local government unit, an organization must provide a list to the local government unit and the plan review agencies of local water plan revisions necessary for compliance with the organization plan. A local water plan may serve as a storm water pollution prevention program if it is approved by the Pollution Control Agency and it complies with the requirements of any applicable national pollutant discharge elimination system/state disposal system storm water permit.</p>
                  <p>B. A plan must include a schedule for implementation of local water plans that requires all local water plans to be adopted not more than two years before the local comprehensive plan is due. A plan must not deviate from the schedule. Extensions of local comprehensive plan due dates do not alter the schedule. Organizations may extend all or portions of local water plans to align with the local comprehensive plan schedule during the initial three years of transition to the amended rule. Notwithstanding local water plan schedules in previously approved plans, all local water plans must be adopted according to this subpart after December 31, 2016.</p>

                  <p>A. Within 30 days of receiving a written petition, board staff are required to send a copy to the plan review authorities and the organization and initiate a preliminary assessment including a review of relevant documents, review of comments from the plan review authorities and the organization, and discussions with involved parties. The results of the preliminary assessment shall be reviewed with the executive director and a report prepared if the executive director determines just cause exists. Just cause may be established if no annual report or audit has been submitted compliant with the requirements in part 8410.0150, or if a plan has not been amended according to part 8410.0140, subpart 1, item C. Just cause may be established for other reasons according to subpart 3a. The executive director of the board may combine multiple petitions involving the same organization and process as one decision. If the executive director determines just cause does not exist, the petitioner, the organization, and the plan review authorities shall be provided written notice of the decision.</p>
                  <p>B. If just cause is established, board staff shall conduct further investigation and prepare a report. The report shall conclude whether a failure to implement exists, define the exact nature of the failure to implement, and recommend a course of action. The report shall be sent to the petitioner, the organization, and the plan review authorities. Board staff shall provide written notification to all those to whom it sent the report of the time and location of a meeting to discuss the contents of the report.</p>
                  <p>C. The organization is allowed 60 days after the meeting in item B to hold a public hearing to develop a formal course of action and send a formal response by mail to the board and known aggrieved parties.</p>

                  <p>B. whether the organization is actively implementing a plan that has been approved by the board within the previous ten years. At a minimum, the organization is addressing its priority issues in the plan, is carrying out its implementation actions, has a current monitoring program to assess whether progress is being made on goals, and has made progress on goals for the priority issues;</p>
                  <p>C. whether the organization is actively implementing the actions adopted in its plan that were derived from a county groundwater plan that has been approved by the board and adopted by the county;</p>
                  <p>D. whether the organization has a contact person that is capable of answering questions about the organization and able to assist local governments and citizens in resolving their concerns;</p>
                  <p>E. whether the organization submits annual activity reports and audits that comply with the requirements in part 8410.0150;</p>
                  <p>F. whether an evaluation under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.102, of an organization's performance, financial, and activity information resulted in any corrective actions or areas of concern;</p>
                  <p>G. whether the organization sufficiently implemented the actions in its previous plan and made progress on attaining the goals in its previous plan;</p>

                  <p>(3) direct the organization to develop an amended plan;</p>
                  <p>(4) set a time period for the submission of an amended plan that reflects the complexity of the amendments;</p>
                  <p>(5) direct staff or the dispute resolution committee to attempt to resolve the matter and to advise the board further; or</p>
                  <p>(6) issue findings of fact and conclusions of its investigation advising the affected organizations, county, or counties of the documented failure to implement the subject plan and advise the appropriate unit of government to complete its responsibility under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.231, subdivision 3, paragraph (b) or (c), within a prescribed period of time.</p>
                  <p>B. The board shall provide written notice of the determination to the petitioner, the organization, and the plan review authorities.</p>
                  <p>C. On issuance of its findings under item A, subitem (5), the board shall notify the appropriate counties to proceed as required by Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.231, subdivision 3, paragraph (b) or (c), as applicable. If a county fails to act after it is notified, the board shall notify state agencies that they may initiate their responsibilities under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.231, subdivision 3, paragraph (g).</p>

                  <p>A. No appeal may be made to the board for the board's dispute resolution committee established under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.101, subdivision 10, to hear and resolve disputes concerning plan implementation until after the procedures in subpart 4 have been completed or until after the executive director has made a decision that just cause does not exist under subpart 3, item A.</p>
                  <p>B. The determination of the board under subpart 4 or the decision of the executive director that just cause does not exist under subpart 3, item A, is final if not appealed to the executive director of the board within 30 days after the date on which the notice of determination or decision is sent to those required to receive notice. A written appeal may be made by the petitioner or the organization. Within 30 days after receiving the appeal, the board, its dispute resolution committee, or its executive director must decide whether to hear the appeal. An appeal may be denied and not heard if the board, its dispute resolution committee, or its executive director decide the appeal is without sufficient merit, trivial, or brought solely for purposes of delay.</p>
                  <p>C. After an appeal is granted, the appeal must be decided by the board within 60 days after the close of the hearing record by the dispute resolution committee. Parties to the appeal are the appellant and the organization. The board or its executive director may elect to join multiple appeals involving the same organization and actions into one decision. A party aggrieved by the board's final decision may seek judicial review as provided in Minnesota Statutes, sections 14.63 to 14.69.</p>

                  <p>A. Within 30 days after receiving the petition with evidence that the watershed district has been served with a copy of the petition, the board or its dispute resolution committee or executive director shall decide whether to grant the petition and hear the appeal. The board or its executive director shall grant the petition unless the appeal is deemed meritless, trivial, untimely, or brought solely for the purposes of delay or it is determined that the petitioner has not exhausted all local administrative remedies.</p>
                  <p>B. The board or its executive director may remand the appealed decision back to the watershed district if the petitioner has not exhausted all local administrative remedies, such as a public hearing, or if the watershed district's record is not adequate. If an appeal is remanded, the watershed district must make a decision within 60 days unless the remand order, or a subsequent order, specifies a longer period.</p>
                  <p>C. After granting the petition, the appeal must be heard by the dispute resolution committee and decided by the board within 60 days after the filing of the watershed district's record, submittal of the written briefs for the appeal, and the hearing by the dispute resolution committee. Parties to the appeal are the appellant and the watershed district. For appeals of rules, interveners are allowed. For appeals of permit decisions, interveners are not allowed unless they have been granted intervener status by the watershed district prior to the final permit decision.</p>
                  <p>D. Upon appeal, the watershed district shall forward to the board the record on which it based its decision within 30 days of the granting of the petition. The board shall make its decision on the appeal after hearing. Thirty days' notice of the hearing must be given by the board to the parties. The parties may present written and oral argument. When the watershed district has made formal findings contemporaneously with its decision or there is an accurate verbatim transcript of the proceedings and the proceedings were fairly conducted, the board shall base its review on the record. Otherwise it may remand the matter.</p>
                  <p>E. In the case of appeals of watershed district rules filed under subpart 1, the board shall affirm the watershed district's decision to adopt the rule if there was a rational basis to adopt the rule and if no procedural errors prejudicial to a party were made.</p>
                  <p>F. In the case of appeals of watershed district permit decisions filed under subpart 2, the board shall affirm the watershed district's decision if substantial evidence supports the findings of fact, if the watershed district correctly applied the law, watershed district rule and the watershed district's board-approved watershed management plan to the facts, and if the watershed district made no procedural errors prejudicial to a party. Otherwise, the board shall reverse the decision, amend it, or remand it with instructions for further proceedings.</p>

                  <p>A. A public transportation authority that requests an expedited appeal hearing via a petition filed with the executive director must include a written brief with the petition setting forth the items in dispute and the reasons for seeking expedited review, including the consequences of proceeding under subpart 3. A copy of the written brief must be provided to the watershed district at the same time as the petition as specified in subpart 2, item B.</p>
                  <p>B. Interveners are not allowed unless they have been granted intervener status by the watershed district prior to the final permit decision.</p>
                  <p>C. The watershed district must submit a copy of the record as soon as possible and in no case later than in conjunction with a written brief to the executive director and the public transportation authority at least ten days before the hearing. No further written submittals by the parties are allowed unless specifically authorized by the board.</p>
                  <p>D. The board or its dispute resolution committee shall hold a hearing within 30 days of receiving the petition. The board shall make a decision within 30 days of the hearing and apply the standard of review in subpart 3, item F, unless it decides there is not sufficient basis to grant the request to expedite the appeal in which case subpart 3 would apply.</p>

                  <p>This chapter implements the regulatory provisions of the Wetland Conservation Act of 1991, Laws 1991, chapter 354, as amended by Laws 1993, chapter 175; Laws 1994, chapter 627; Laws 1996, chapter 462; Laws 2000, chapter 382; Laws 2001, chapter 146; Laws 2002, chapter 220; Laws 2003, chapter 128; Laws 2004, chapters 221 and 255; Laws 2007, chapters 57 and 131; and Laws 2008, chapter 368. This chapter shall be interpreted to implement the purpose of the act, which is to:</p>
                  <p>A. achieve no net loss in the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of Minnesota's existing wetlands;</p>
                  <p>B. increase the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of Minnesota's wetlands by restoring or enhancing diminished or drained wetlands;</p>
                  <p>C. avoid direct or indirect impacts from activities that destroy or diminish the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of wetlands; and</p>
                  <p>D. replace wetland values where avoidance of activity is not feasible and prudent.</p>

                  <p>The regulatory provisions of the Wetland Conservation Act advance the purpose in this part by requiring persons proposing to impact a wetland to first, attempt to avoid the impact; second, attempt to minimize the impact; and finally, replace any impacted area with another wetland of at least equal function and value. As specified in greater detail in part 8420.0420, certain projects are exempt from the requirement for a replacement plan under the Wetland Conservation Act.</p>

                  <p>B. This chapter does not regulate normal farming practices in a wetland. "Normal farming practices" means ranching, silvicultural, grazing, and farming activities such as plowing, seeding, cultivating, and harvesting for the production of feed, food, and fiber products, but does not include activities that result in the draining of wetlands.</p>
                  <p>C. This chapter does not prevent control of noxious weeds if the control does not impact the wetland.</p>
                  <p>D. This chapter does not regulate impacts to incidental wetlands. "Incidental wetlands" are wetland areas that the landowner can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the local government unit, were created in nonwetland areas solely by actions, the purpose of which was not to create the wetland. Incidental wetlands include drainage ditches, impoundments, or excavations constructed in nonwetlands solely for the purpose of effluent treatment, containment of waste material, storm water retention or detention, drainage, soil and water conservation practices, and water quality improvements and not as part of a wetland replacement process that may, over time, take on wetland characteristics.</p>
                  <p>E. This chapter does not apply to the public waters and public waters wetlands as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.005, subdivisions 15 and 15a, which have been inventoried by the commissioner according to Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.201, except that:</p>
                  <p>(1) for projects affecting public waters wetlands, and for public transportation projects affecting the wetland areas of public waters, when the commissioner waives the requirement for a public waters work permit consistent with chapter 6115, the local government unit must make replacement, banking, wetland boundary, wetland type, no-loss, public road project notification, or exemption decisions; or</p>
                  <p>(2) for projects affecting both public waters and wetlands, the local government unit may, by written agreement with the commissioner, waive the requirement for a replacement plan, no-loss, or exemption decision if a public waters work permit is required and the commissioner includes the provisions of this chapter in the public waters work permit.</p>
                  <p>F. This chapter is in addition to other regulations including those of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, United States Department of Agriculture, Minnesota state agencies, watershed districts, and local governments.</p>
                  <p>G. This chapter does not apply to peat mining as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 93.461, which is subject to the permit to mine and reclamation requirements of Minnesota Statutes, sections 93.44 to 93.51, and the rules of the commissioner adopted under those sections.</p>
                  <p>H. This chapter does not require state agencies to obtain local government unit approvals. However, the state agencies must follow the procedures and standards prescribed by this chapter.</p>
                  <p>I. In addition to the provisions of this chapter, governmental decisions on impacting wetlands are subject to Minnesota Statutes, chapters 116B and 116D, which provide that an action which is likely to have material adverse effects on natural resources must not be allowed if there is a feasible and prudent alternative consistent with the requirements of the public health, safety, and welfare and the state's paramount concern for the protection of its natural resources. Economic considerations alone do not justify adversely effective actions.</p>

                  <p>A. "Wetlands" means lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For purposes of this subpart, wetlands must:</p>
                  <p>(1) have a predominance of hydric soils;</p>
                  <p>(2) be inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions; and</p>
                  <p>(3) under normal circumstances, support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation.</p>
                  <p>B. "A wetland" or "the wetland" means a distinct hydrologic feature with characteristics of item A, surrounded by nonwetland and including all contiguous wetland types, except those connected solely by riverine wetlands. "Wetland area" means a portion of a wetland or the wetland.</p>
                  <p>C. Wetlands does not include public waters wetlands and public waters unless reclassified as wetlands by the commissioner under Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.201.</p>
                  <p>D. The wetland size is the area within its boundary. The boundary must be determined according to the United States Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual (January 1987). The wetland type must be determined according to Wetlands of the United States, (1971 edition). Both documents are incorporated by reference under part 8420.0112, items A and B. The local government unit may seek the advice of the technical evaluation panel as to the wetland size and type.</p>

                  <p>"Wetland type" or "type" means a wetland type classified according to Wetlands of the United States (1956 and 1971 editions), as summarized in this subpart. Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States is a separate, parallel wetland typing system that may be used to characterize components of a wetland. Both documents are incorporated by reference under part 8420.0112, items A and B.</p>
                  <p>A. "Type 1 wetlands" are seasonally flooded basins or flats in which soil is covered with water or is waterlogged during variable seasonal periods but usually is well-drained during much of the growing season. Type 1 wetlands are located in depressions and in overflow bottomlands along watercourses. In type 1 wetlands, vegetation varies greatly according to season and duration of flooding and includes bottomland hardwoods as well as herbaceous growths.</p>
                  <p>B. "Type 2 wetlands" are inland fresh meadows in which soil is usually without standing water during most of the growing season but is waterlogged within at least a few inches of the surface. Vegetation includes grasses, sedges, rushes, and various broad-leafed plants. Meadows may fill shallow basins, sloughs, or farmland sags or may border shallow marshes on the landward side.</p>
                  <p>C. "Type 3 wetlands" are inland shallow fresh marshes in which soil is usually waterlogged early during a growing season and often covered with as much as six inches or more of water. Vegetation includes grasses, bulrushes, spikerushes, and various other marsh plants such as cattails, arrowheads, pickerelweed, and smartweeds. These marshes may nearly fill shallow lake basins or sloughs or may border deep marshes on the landward side and are also common as seep areas on irrigated lands.</p>
                  <p>D. "Type 4 wetlands" are inland deep fresh marshes in which soil is usually covered with six inches to three feet or more of water during the growing season. Vegetation includes cattails, reeds, bulrushes, spikerushes, and wild rice. In open areas, pondweeds, naiads, coontail, water milfoils, waterweeds, duckweeds, water lilies, or spatterdocks may occur. These deep marshes may completely fill shallow lake basins, potholes, limestone sinks, and sloughs or may border open water in such depressions.</p>
                  <p>E. "Type 5 wetlands" are inland open fresh water, shallow ponds, and reservoirs in which water is usually less than ten feet deep and is fringed by a border of emergent vegetation similar to open areas of type 4 wetland.</p>
                  <p>F. "Type 6 wetlands" are shrub swamps in which soil is usually waterlogged during the growing season and is often covered with as much as six inches of water. Vegetation includes alders, willows, buttonbush, dogwoods, and swamp privet. This type occurs mostly along sluggish streams and occasionally on floodplains.</p>
                  <p>G. "Type 7 wetlands" are wooded swamps in which soil is waterlogged at least to within a few inches of the surface during the growing season and is often covered with as much as one foot of water. This type occurs mostly along sluggish streams, on floodplains, on flat uplands, and in shallow basins. Trees include tamarack, arborvitae, black spruce, balsam, red maple, and black ash. Northern evergreen swamps usually have a thick ground cover of mosses. Deciduous swamps frequently support beds of duckweeds and smartweeds.</p>
                  <p>H. "Type 8 wetlands" are bogs in which soil is usually waterlogged and supports a spongy covering of mosses. This type occurs mostly in shallow basins, on flat uplands, and along sluggish streams. Vegetation is woody or herbaceous or both. Typical plants are heath shrubs, sphagnum moss, and sedges. In the north, leatherleaf, Labrador-tea, cranberries, carex, and cottongrass are often present. Scattered, often stunted, black spruce and tamarack may occur.</p>

                  <p>A. A local government unit may request the board to reclassify a county or major watershed wholly or partly within its jurisdiction on the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory documentation from the local government, the board must change the classification of a county or major watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the board must publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.</p>
                  <p>B. One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may request the local government unit to reclassify the county or major watershed on the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of the petition, the citizens must provide satisfactory documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit must consider the petition and forward the request to the board or provide a reason why the petition is denied.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subpart <inline name="num">1</inline>. <b>Determining local government unit.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>The local government unit responsible for making decisions must be determined according to items A to J.</p>
                  <p>A. Outside the seven-county metropolitan area, the local government unit is the county or city in which the activity is located, or its delegate.</p>
                  <p>B. In the seven-county metropolitan area, the local government unit is the city, town, or water management organization regulating surface-water-related matters in the area in which the activity is located, or its delegate. The watershed management plan adopted under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.231, and related board rules will normally indicate the appropriate local government unit. Lacking an indication, the local government unit must be the city, town, or its delegate.</p>
                  <p>C. For activities on state land, the local government unit is the state agency, or the agency's designee, with administrative responsibility for that land. However, state agencies must coordinate with local government units that would otherwise have jurisdiction, according to items A and B, when conducting or making decisions on activities in wetlands.</p>
                  <p>D. Notwithstanding items A to G, the Department of Natural Resources is the approving authority for activities associated with projects requiring permits to mine under Minnesota Statutes, section 93.481, and for projects affecting calcareous fens.</p>
                  <p>E. Implementation of this chapter and the act may be delegated from a county, city, or town, as applicable according to item A or B, to a soil and water conservation district or other governmental entity by the passage of resolutions by both parties. The delegation becomes effective when resolutions have been passed by both parties, or on the date specified in the resolutions, whichever is later. Both parties must provide notice to the board, the commissioner, and the soil and water conservation district within 15 business days of adoption of the resolution. The notice must include a copy of the resolution and a description of the applicable geographic area.</p>
                  <p>F. If the activity is located in two jurisdictions, the local government unit is the one exercising zoning authority over the project or, if both have zoning authority, the one in which most of the wetland impacts will occur. If no zoning permits are required, the local government unit is the one in which most of the wetland impacts will occur. If an activity will affect wetlands in more than one local government unit, the board may coordinate the project review to ensure consistency and consensus among the local government units involved. Local government units may maintain separate jurisdiction if mutually agreed upon.</p>
                  <p>G. For a replacement site located in more than one jurisdiction, the local government unit is the one in which most of the replacement wetland area occurs.</p>
                  <p>H. For replacement plans where the project-specific replacement will occur in a different local government unit than the impact, approval of all local government units involved or as specified in items A to G constitutes final approval of the replacement plan and is required before the project may proceed. The local government unit with jurisdiction for the impact site must approve all components of the replacement plan, following the procedures required by this chapter. The local government unit with jurisdiction for the replacement site must limit the review to evaluation of the replacement site and make a decision accordingly. As part of the approval of the replacement plan, the local government unit with jurisdiction for the replacement site assumes responsibility for ensuring compliance with monitoring provisions according to parts 8420.0800 to 8420.0820. The local government unit with jurisdiction for the replacement site may enter into joint powers agreements with a local government unit with jurisdiction for the impact site, assess fees, or develop other procedures considered necessary to facilitate the process.</p>
                  <p>I. For instances where the activity or replacement occurs in multiple jurisdictions, the local government unit with decision-making authority must coordinate with the other local government units.</p>
                  <p>J. The board shall resolve all questions as to which government entity is the responsible authority, applying the guidelines in items A to I.</p>

                  <p>A. Local government units are responsible for making decisions on applications made under this chapter. Each local government unit of the state, except tribal lands and state agencies, must send a written acknowledgment, including a copy of the adopting resolution, to the board that it is assuming its responsibilities under this chapter and the act.</p>
                  <p>B. A local government unit must provide knowledgeable and trained staff with expertise in water resource management to manage the program or secure a qualified delegate. Otherwise, the board may declare a moratorium as prescribed in subpart 3 or take other appropriate legal action to ensure proper implementation and compliance with this chapter. The board may establish standards and requirements for training, experience, and certification.</p>
                  <p>C. The local government unit may, through resolution, rule, or ordinance, place decision-making authority with staff according to procedures it establishes. For final decisions made by staff, the local government unit must establish a local appeal process that includes an evidentiary public hearing before appointed or elected officials.</p>
                  <p>D. As provided for in part 8420.0240, technical questions concerning the public value, location, size, and type of wetland must be submitted to the technical evaluation panel. The local government unit may use a technical evaluation panel to predetermine public value, location, size, or type of wetlands under its jurisdiction and use this determination in administering this chapter and the act.</p>
                  <p>E. An application must not be approved unless entitlement thereto is established by a fair preponderance of the evidence. For each finding of fact and recommendation included in a written technical evaluation panel report that is not adopted by the local government unit, the local government unit must provide detailed reasons for rejecting the finding of fact or recommendation in its record of decision; otherwise, the local government unit has not sufficiently considered the technical evaluation panel report.</p>
                  <p>F. In the absence of an application, the local government unit may evaluate information related to a potential activity upon the request of a landowner. The evaluation provided does not constitute a decision for the purposes of parts 8420.0100 to 8420.0935.</p>
                  <p>G. The local government unit must retain a record of all decisions for a minimum of ten years after all applicable requirements and conditions pertaining to the project are fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>H. The local government unit and soil and water conservation district may charge processing fees in amounts not greater than are necessary to cover the reasonable costs of implementing this chapter and for technical and administrative assistance to landowners in processing other applications for projects affecting wetlands.</p>
                  <p>I. The local government unit must annually report information to the board regarding implementation of this chapter in a format and time period prescribed by the board. Failure to comply with the board's reporting requirements may subject the local government to a penalty under subpart 3.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">3</inline>. <b>Failure to apply law.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. If a local government unit fails to acknowledge in writing its responsibilities under this chapter and the act, as required in subpart 2, the board must impose, in the local government unit's jurisdiction, a 60-day moratorium on making decisions and implementing this chapter and the act. The board must notify the local government unit in writing of the start and end dates of the moratorium. The board must end the moratorium within the 60 days upon written agreement by the local government unit that it will assume, and is currently capable of implementing, its duties under this chapter and the act. If at the end of the initial 60-day moratorium a written agreement has not been made for the local government unit to apply the law, the board may extend the moratorium until the local government unit agrees to apply the law.</p>
                  <p>B. If the board has information that a local government unit is not following this chapter or the act in making decisions; if the local government unit does not have knowledgeable and trained staff with experience in water resource management; or if the local government unit fails to comply with the board's reporting requirements, the board must notify the local government unit in writing of its concerns. The local government unit must respond in writing within 60 days of being notified by the board. If not satisfied with the local government unit's written response, or none is received, the board must ask the local government unit to appear at a hearing before the board to discuss the matter. The board may invite comments from other local governments or state and federal agencies. If the board determines at the hearing that corrective action is necessary, the board must write the local government unit directing specific corrective action to occur within 60 days of receiving the board's decision. The notice must explain the reason for the action. If, after the 60-day period, the local government unit has not corrected the problem to the satisfaction of the board, the board must declare a moratorium as prescribed in item A or take other appropriate legal action to ensure compliance.</p>
                  <p>C. When a moratorium is declared as prescribed in item A or B, a decision cannot be made on an application because a local government unit authorized to implement this chapter does not exist while the moratorium is in effect. An application pending a local government unit decision when a moratorium is declared must be returned by the local government unit to the applicant within 15 business days of the moratorium being placed in effect. An application submitted while a moratorium is in effect must be returned by the local government unit to the applicant with an explanation and within 15 business days of the local government unit's receipt of the application.</p>

                <p>A. For each local government unit, there is a technical evaluation panel. Panel membership consists of: a technical professional employee of the board, a technical professional employee of the soil and water conservation district of the county in which the activity is occurring, and a technical professional with expertise in water resource management appointed by the local government unit. For projects affecting public waters, public waters wetlands, or wetlands within the shoreland protection zone, the panel also includes a technical professional employee of the Department of Natural Resources. The local government unit must coordinate the panel.</p>
                <p>B. Two members of the technical evaluation panel must be knowledgeable and trained in applying methodologies of the United States Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual (January 1987), Wetland Plants and Plant Communities of Minnesota &amp; Wisconsin (S. Eggers and D. Reed 1997), Wetlands of the United States (United States Fish and Wildlife Service Circular 39, 1971 edition), and Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States (Cowardin, et al., 1979 edition), including updates and supplements, and any modifications or guidance provided by the board. The panel must also be knowledgeable and trained in evaluation of wetland functions and the resulting public value. The panel may seek advice and assistance from others with additional expertise to help the panel in its work.</p>
                <p>C. The technical evaluation panel, if requested to do so by the local government unit, the landowner, or a member of the panel, must make technical findings and recommendations regarding applications, the scope of this chapter and the act, the applicability of exemption and no-loss standards, wetland functions and the resulting public value, direct and indirect impacts, possible violations of this chapter and the act, enforcement matters under part 8420.0900, comprehensive wetland protection and management plans and implementing rules and ordinances, and other technical issues related to implementation of this chapter. The panel must review applications for replacement of public road projects submitted according to part 8420.0544, banking projects according to parts 8420.0700 to 8420.0755, and replacement wetland monitoring as provided in parts 8420.0800 to 8420.0820. The panel must provide its findings to the local government unit for consideration. For violations of this chapter that may result in the issuance of an enforcement order, the panel must consult with the enforcement authority.</p>
                <p>D. The panel's recommendation to the local government unit may recommend approval, approval with changes or conditions, or denial of an application. When a technical evaluation panel assembles findings or makes a recommendation, the local government unit must consider the findings or recommendation of the panel in its approval or denial of an application. The panel shall make no findings or recommendations without at least one member having made an on-site inspection. Panel findings and recommendations must be documented and endorsed by a majority of the members. If the local government unit does not agree with the panel's findings and recommendation, the detailed reasons for the disagreement must be part of the local government unit's record of decision.</p>
                <p>E. Applicants must cooperate in providing local government unit staff and members of the technical evaluation panel and their designated experts with access to proposed project sites for investigation. Investigations must be preceded by notice to the landowner or designated agent, unless prior approval has been granted. If an applicant refuses to allow access, the local government unit may deny an application.</p>

                  <p>A. Within 15 business days of receipt of a complete application, the local government unit must send a copy of the application and a notice of application on a form provided by the board to members of the technical evaluation panel; the watershed district or water management organization, if there is one; the commissioner; and individual members of the public who request a copy. The notice must identify the type of application, the date the comment period ends, and where to submit comments. Individual members of the public who request a copy must be sent a summary of the application that includes information to identify the applicant and the location and scope of the project. The comment period must be at least 15 business days from the date the notice of application is sent. Revisions of an approved and valid replacement plan must be noticed according to this subpart by sending a summary of the proposed revisions if:</p>
                  <p>(1) the wetland area to be impacted under the revised replacement plan is:</p>
                  <p>(a) increased by more than ten percent;</p>
                  <p>(b) a different type;</p>
                  <p>(c) part of a different wetland; or</p>
                  <p>(d) more than 500 feet from the location of the previously approved wetland impact; or</p>
                  <p>(2) the replacement is:</p>
                  <p>(a) a different type;</p>
                  <p>(b) more than 500 feet from the location of the previously approved replacement; or</p>
                  <p>(c) a different action eligible for credit.</p>
                  <p>B. This subpart does not apply to exemption or no-loss applications. However, a local government unit may issue a notice for an exemption or no-loss application following the requirements in this part when the local government unit believes that input from those required to receive notice will be useful in determining whether an exemption or no-loss applies.</p>

                  <p>The local government unit's decision must be based on the standards and procedures required by this chapter and on the technical evaluation panel's findings and recommendation, when provided. The local government unit must consider and include in its record of decision the technical evaluation panel's recommendation, when provided, to approve, modify, or deny the application. The local government unit must also consider any comments received from those required to receive notice. The local government unit's decision must be made in compliance with the time period prescribed by Minnesota Statutes, section 15.99, which, on the effective date of this part, generally requires a decision in 60 days. The local government unit may make on-site exemption and no-loss decisions if the decisions are noticed according to subpart 5 and project details are provided sufficient to document eligibility. The local government unit's decision is valid for three years or as otherwise specified in the local government unit's decision when the technical evaluation panel advises that a longer period is justified in accordance with the standards in parts 8420.0100 to 8420.0935.</p>

Wetland areas created solely by beaver activities may be drained by removing those materials placed by beaver. Drainage is permitted by removing or moving materials blocking installed roadway culverts and related drainage structures. Additional excavation or removal of other materials is not permitted unless it can be shown by aerial photographs that the proposed activity will not drain or fill wetland that was there before the beaver dam was built or before the culvert became plugged;</p>
                <p>C. temporary or seasonal water level management activities done for the purpose of performing maintenance or as part of vegetation or habitat management activities, which will not result in the conversion of a wetland to a nonwetland or conversion of a nondegraded wetland to a different type;</p>
                <p>D. an activity conducted as part of an approved replacement or banking plan, conducted or authorized by public agencies for the purpose of wetland restoration or fish and wildlife habitat restoration or improvement according to the guidance referenced in part 8420.0112, items J and H, or repair and maintenance of earthen containment structures;</p>
                <p>E. excavation limited to removal of deposited sediment in wetlands that are presently utilized as storm water management basins, or excavation and removal of contaminated substrate, when the excavated area is limited to the minimum dimensions necessary for achieving the desired purpose and stabilized to prevent water quality degradation;</p>
                <p>F. an activity associated with the operation, routine maintenance, or emergency repair of existing utilities and public works structures, including pipelines, provided the activity does not result in additional wetland intrusion or additional impacts, either wholly or partially;</p>
                <p>G. temporarily crossing or entering a wetland to perform silvicultural activities, including timber harvest as part of a forest management activity, so long as the activity limits the impact on the hydrologic and biologic characteristics of the wetland; the activity does not result in the construction of dikes, drainage ditches, tile lines, or buildings; and the timber harvesting and other silvicultural practices do not result in the drainage of the wetland or public waters; or</p>
                <p>H. a temporary impact that is rectified by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland. No-loss under this item only applies if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
                <p>(1) the physical characteristics of the affected wetland, including ground elevations, contours, inlet dimensions, outlet dimensions, substrate, plant communities, and hydrologic regime, are restored to preproject conditions sufficient to ensure that all preproject functions are restored;</p>
                <p>(2) the activity is completed and the physical characteristics of the wetland are restored within six months of the start of the activity, unless an extension is granted by the local government unit after consultation with the technical evaluation panel;</p>
                <p>(3) the landowner provides sufficient financial assurance acceptable to the local government unit to cover the estimated cost to restore the wetland to preproject conditions. The local government unit must return any remaining financial assurance to the landowner upon a determination by the local government unit that the conditions in this item have been met by the landowner; and</p>
                <p>(4) a no-loss has not been approved under this item for a particular site within a wetland within the previous ten years, except that repairs to the original project may be allowed under the no-loss if the local government unit determines the request to be necessary and reasonable.</p>

                  <p>A. An impact is exempt from replacement if it qualifies for any one of the listed exemptions. An impact is not disqualified when it is indicated as not exempt under a different exemption. Persons proposing to conduct an exempt activity may contact the local government unit to verify eligibility for an exemption and to evaluate alternatives to avoid or minimize wetland impacts. When the total amount of impact exceeds the amount allowed under the applicable exemption, the impact is not exempt and the entire amount of impact must be replaced.</p>
                  <p>B. No exemptions apply to:</p>
                  <p>(1) calcareous fens as identified by the commissioner;</p>
                  <p>(2) wetlands that have been deposited in the state wetland bank;</p>
                  <p>(3) wetlands that have previously received replacement credit as a result of an approved replacement or banking plan; or</p>
                  <p>(4) wetlands that were partially impacted, so that the remainder would be eligible for an exemption, when the exemption would not have been applicable before the impact. Impacts to any such wetlands are subject to the replacement requirements of this chapter or, for calcareous fens, part 8420.0935.</p>
                  <p>C. Exemptions may not be combined on a project.</p>
                  <p>D. Present and future owners of wetlands impacted without replacement under an exemption for agricultural activities in subpart 2 or drainage in subpart 3 must make no use of the wetland area after it is impacted, other than as agricultural land or other use specified in subpart 2, for at least ten years after the impact unless it is first replaced according to Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.222. Except for land in public ownership, at the time of impact, the local government unit may require the landowner to record a notice of these restrictions in the office of the county recorder for the county in which the project is located if the local government unit determines the wetland area impacted is at risk of conversion to a nonagricultural use or use other than that specified in subpart 2 within ten years, based on the zoning classification, proximity to a municipality or full-service road, or other criteria as determined by the local government unit. In making a decision under this item, the local government unit must review the applicable comprehensive plan, if one exists, when evaluating the risk of conversion to a nonagricultural use and monitor and enforce the prohibition on using the area impacted for a nonagricultural purpose for at least ten years. At a minimum, the recorded document must contain the name or names of the landowners, a legal description of the property to which the restrictions apply, a statement of the restrictions, the date on which the restrictions expire, the name of the local government that approved the exemption, if an exemption occurred, the signatures of all owners, and an acknowledgment.</p>

                  <p>A replacement plan is not required for:</p>
                  <p>A. impacts resulting from agricultural activities in a wetland that was planted with annually seeded crops or was in a crop rotation seeding of pasture grass or legumes in six of the last ten years prior to January 1, 1991. Documentation, such as aerial photographs, United States Department of Agriculture records, or other applicable documentation may be used as evidence for this exemption. Impacts eligible for this exemption must be to type 1 or 2 wetlands;</p>
                  <p>B. impacts resulting from agricultural activities in a type 1 wetland on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use, except for bottomland hardwood type 1 wetlands, and impacts resulting from agricultural activities in a type 2 or 6 wetland that is less than two acres in size and located on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use;</p>
                  <p>C. impacts resulting from soil and water conservation projects that are certified by soil and water conservation district technical staff after review by the technical evaluation panel, if the project minimizes adverse effects on the hydrologic and biologic characteristics of the wetland. For purposes of this item, examples of soil and water conservation projects include those identified in the State Cost Share Program Manual, available from the board or soil and water conservation districts, and federally funded demonstration, research, and cost share programs and projects;</p>
                  <p>D. filling a wetland to accommodate wheeled booms on irrigation devices if the fill does not impede normal drainage;</p>
                  <p>E. impacts resulting from aquaculture activities, including pond excavation and construction and maintenance of associated access roads and dikes, authorized under and conducted in accordance with a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344, but not including construction or expansion of buildings;</p>
                  <p>F. impacts resulting from wild rice production activities, including necessary diking and other activities authorized under a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344; or</p>
                  <p>G. impacts resulting from agricultural activities that are subject to federal farm program restrictions that meet minimum state standards under this chapter and Minnesota Statutes, sections 103A.202 and 103B.3355, and that have been approved by the board, the commissioners of natural resources and agriculture, and the Pollution Control Agency. An exemption under this item is not valid until such approval is obtained. If approved, the conditions and standards shall be noticed by the board to local government units and published in the State Register. The conditions and standards take effect 30 days after publication and remain in effect unless superseded by subsequent statute, rule, or notice in the State Register. Upon taking effect, this exemption only applies to impacts on agricultural land annually enrolled in the federal Farm Program that are not beyond what is:</p>
                  <p>(1) allowed under the other exemptions in this part;</p>
                  <p>(2) necessary to replace, maintain, or repair existing private drainage infrastructure with a capacity not to exceed that which was originally constructed; or</p>
                  <p>(3) replaced at a ratio of 1:1 or greater under United States Department of Agriculture provisions as supported by documentation from the United States Department of Agriculture, which must be included as evidence to support this exemption.</p>
                  <p>If the impact would result in loss of eligibility, the landowner cannot qualify for the exemption.</p>

                  <p>A. For the purposes of this subpart, "public drainage system" means a drainage system as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 103E.005, subdivision 12, and any ditch or tile lawfully connected to the drainage system.</p>
                  <p>B. A replacement plan is not required for:</p>
                  <p>(1) impacts resulting from maintenance or repair of existing public drainage systems conducted or authorized by a public drainage authority under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 103E, when the maintenance or repair does not drain type 3, 4, or 5 wetlands that have existed for more than 25 years before the proposed impact; or</p>
                  <p>(2) impacts resulting from maintenance or repair of existing drainage systems other than public drainage systems, when the maintenance or repair does not drain wetlands that have existed for more than 25 years before the proposed impact.</p>
                  <p>For projects proposed under this item, the landowner must provide documentation that the wetlands to be partially or completely impacted by the maintenance or repair have not existed for more than 25 years. Documentation may include, but is not limited to: aerial photographs, climatological records, soil borings, vegetative analysis, elevation surveys, or drainage system maintenance records.</p>
                  <p>C. A replacement plan is not required for:</p>
                  <p>(1) draining a wetland on agricultural land when the wetland was:</p>
                  <p>(a) planted with annually seeded crops before July 5, except for crops that are normally planted after this date, in eight out of the ten most recent years before the impact;</p>
                  <p>(b) in a crop rotation seeding of pasture grass, cover crop, or legumes or was fallow for a crop production purpose in eight out of the ten most recent years before the impact; or</p>
                  <p>(c) enrolled in a state or federal land conservation program and met the requirements of unit (a) or (b) before enrollment;</p>
                  <p>(2) draining type 1 wetlands, or up to five acres of type 2 or 6 wetlands, in an unincorporated area on land that has been assessed drainage benefits for a public drainage system, provided that:</p>
                  <p>(a) during the 20-year period that ended January 1, 1992:</p>
                  <p>i. there was an expenditure made from the drainage system account for the public drainage system;</p>
                  <p>ii. the public drainage system was repaired or maintained as approved by the drainage authority; or</p>
                  <p>iii. no repair or maintenance of the public drainage system was required under Minnesota Statutes, section 103E.705, subdivision 1, as determined by the public drainage authority; and</p>
                  <p>(b) the wetlands are not drained for conversion to:</p>
                  <p>i. platted lots;</p>
                  <p>ii. planned unit, commercial, or industrial developments; or</p>
                  <p>iii. any development with more than one residential unit per 40 acres, except for parcels subject to local zoning standards that allow family members to establish an additional residence on the same 40 acres.</p>
                  <p>If wetlands drained under this subitem are converted to prohibited uses during the ten-year period following drainage, the wetlands must be replaced under Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.222.</p>
                  <p>Documentation such as aerial photographs, United States Department of Agriculture records, or other applicable documentation may be used as evidence for the exemption under this item.</p>
                  <p>D. For projects completed under this subpart, spoil must be placed and stabilized in a manner that minimizes wetland impacts without jeopardizing the stability of the ditch or contributing to the degradation of downstream water quality.</p>
                  <p>E. A public drainage authority may, as part of a repair, install control structures, realign a ditch, construct dikes along a ditch, or make other modifications as necessary to prevent drainage of a wetland.</p>
                  <p>F. Wetlands and public waters of all types that could be drained as a part of a public drainage repair project are eligible for the permanent wetlands preserve program established under Minnesota Statutes, section 103F.516. The board must give priority to acquisition of easements on type 3, 4, or 5 wetlands that have been in existence for more than 25 years on public drainage systems and other wetlands that have the greatest risk of drainage from a public drainage repair project.</p>

                  <p>No person may impact a wetland, wholly or partially, without being eligible for an exemption or no-loss, or first having a wetland replacement plan approved by the local government unit. Before approval of a replacement plan, the local government unit must ensure that the applicant has exhausted all possibilities to avoid and minimize wetland impacts according to sequencing in part 8420.0520. The applicant must demonstrate to the local government unit that the replacement plan complies with this part and parts 8420.0515 to 8420.0528. A replacement plan that fails to meet the requirements of this chapter is inadequate in replacing lost function and value and must be denied by the local government unit.</p>

                  <p>A. Avoidance is required when indicated by part 8420.0515.</p>
                  <p>B. Wetland dependence determination:</p>
                  <p>(1) Based on information provided by the applicant, the local government unit must determine if the proposed project is wetland dependent. A project is wetland dependent if wetland features or functions are essential to fulfill the basic purpose of the project. A wetland present at the site of a proposed project does not make that project wetland dependent.</p>
                  <p>(2) A project that has been determined by the local government unit to be wetland dependent is exempt from the analysis of avoidance alternatives in item C.</p>
                  <p>C. Alternatives analysis:</p>
                  <p>(1) In addition to documentation for the proposed project, the applicant must provide the local government unit with documentation describing at least two alternatives that avoid wetland impacts, one of which may be the no-build alternative. For projects that repair or rehabilitate existing infrastructure, only one alternative is required. The alternatives may include consideration of alternate sites or alternative project configurations on the proposed site. The alternatives must be judged by the local government unit as good faith efforts, or the local government unit may require the applicant to redraft them for reconsideration.</p>
                  <p>(2) The local government unit must determine whether any proposed feasible and prudent alternatives are available that would avoid impacts to wetlands. An alternative is considered feasible and prudent if it meets all of the following requirements:</p>
                  <p>(a) it is capable of being done from an engineering point of view;</p>
                  <p>(b) it is in accordance with accepted engineering standards and practices;</p>
                  <p>(c) it is consistent with reasonable requirements of the public health, safety, and welfare;</p>
                  <p>(d) it is an environmentally preferable alternative based on a review of social, economic, and environmental impacts; and</p>
                  <p>(e) it would create no truly unusual problems.</p>
                  <p>(3) The local government unit must consider the following in evaluating avoidance alternatives as applicable:</p>
                  <p>(a) whether the basic project purpose can be reasonably accomplished using one or more other sites in the same general area that would avoid wetland impacts. An alternate site must not be excluded from consideration only because it includes or requires an area not owned by the applicant that could reasonably be obtained, used, expanded, or managed to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed project;</p>
                  <p>(b) the general suitability of the project site and alternate sites considered by the applicant to achieve the purpose of the project;</p>
                  <p>(c) whether reasonable modification of the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project would avoid impacts to wetlands;</p>
                  <p>(d) efforts by the applicant to accommodate or remove constraints on alternatives imposed by zoning standards or infrastructure, including requests for conditional use permits, variances, or planned unit developments;</p>
                  <p>(e) the physical, economic, and demographic requirements of the project. Economic considerations alone do not make an alternative not feasible and prudent; and</p>
                  <p>(f) the amount, distribution, condition, and public value of wetlands and associated resources to be affected by the project and the potential for direct and indirect effects over time.</p>
                  <p>(4) If the local government unit determines that a feasible and prudent alternative exists that would avoid impacts to wetlands, it must deny the replacement plan. If no feasible and prudent alternative is available that would avoid impacts to wetlands, the local government unit must evaluate the replacement plan for compliance with subparts 4 to 8.</p>

                  <p>D. the sensitivity of the site design to the natural features of the site, including topography, hydrology, and existing vegetation;</p>
                  <p>E. the value, function, and spatial distribution of the wetlands on the site;</p>

                  <p>(3) confine impacts to the fringe or periphery of the wetland; and</p>

                  <p>A. Flexibility in application of the sequencing steps may be requested by the applicant and allowed at the discretion of the local government unit, subject to the conditions in item B, as determined by the local government unit, if:</p>

                  <p>(3) the only feasible and prudent upland site available for the project or replacement has greater ecosystem function and public value than the wetland. This may be appropriate only if the applicant:</p>

                  <p>(2) project-specific replacement within the same major watershed or county as the impacted wetland, a majority of which is in-kind.</p>

                  <p>B. For replacement via banking, impacts in bank service area 10 that are replaced in bank service area 9 or the Des Moines River Basin in bank service area 8 and impacts in bank service area 1 that are replaced in bank service area 2 count as replacement within the same bank service area for the purpose of reducing the minimum required replacement ratio according to this subpart.</p>
                  <p>C. For purposes of determining project-specific replacement ratios, the local government unit may authorize the use of out-of-kind wetland replacement in the same ratio allowed for in-kind replacement. Out-of-kind replacement may qualify for the same ratio as in-kind when it consists of a type or plant community that has been significantly lost in the watershed or that will provide important functional benefits to the watershed in accordance with the principles described in part 8420.0830, subpart 5, as determined by the technical evaluation panel based on a review of available evidence or according to a local plan approved by the board. A reduced ratio for out-of-kind replacement is typically not appropriate for wetlands that are difficult to replace, such as white cedar swamps or bogs.</p>
                  <p>D. Wetland replacement must be of a size sufficient to ensure that it provides equal or greater public value than the impacted wetland it will replace. The actual replacement ratio required may be more than the ratio required in item A if the local government unit determines that a higher ratio is necessary to replace the public value of the wetland lost. In no case shall the replacement ratio be less than 1:1 in greater than 80 percent areas or agricultural land, and 2:1 in all other areas.</p>
                  <p>E. Owners of wetlands impacted for use as agricultural land may make no use of the wetland area after it is impacted, other than as agricultural land, for a period of ten years unless future replacement to achieve a ratio equaling or exceeding the appropriate ratio for nonagricultural land in item A occurs. The landowner must record a notice of this restriction in the office of the county recorder in which the project is located, and, as a condition of local government unit approval, provide documentation of the recording to the local government unit.</p>
                  <p>F. The board may approve special replacement ratios based on data derived from comprehensive inventories of replacement opportunities. The board must give notice of the replacement ratios to local government units and must publish the ratios in the State Register. The board must provide opportunities for public input and comment before publishing the special replacement ratios. The conditions and standards take effect 30 days after publication and remain in effect unless superseded by subsequent statute, rule, or notice in the State Register.</p>

                  <p>A. The preferred method of replacement is that which takes advantage of naturally occurring hydrogeomorphic conditions with minimal landscape alteration and is most likely to result in a wetland area that functions wholly, perpetually, and naturally. Wetland restoration is generally preferred over creation, and restoration of completely impacted wetlands is generally preferred over other methods of replacement.</p>
                  <p>B. Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished according to the ecology of the landscape area. The replacement site must be ecologically suitable for providing the desired functions and compatible with adjacent land uses. A replacement or banking plan that would result in wetland types or characteristics that do not naturally occur in the landscape area in which the replacement will occur must be denied. Replacement must not adversely affect other habitat types or ecological communities that are important in maintaining the overall biological diversity of the area.</p>
                  <p>C. Replacement projects must be located and designed, to the maximum extent practicable, to be self-sustaining once performance standards have been achieved. "Self-sustaining" refers to the ability of a wetland to provide the desired functions over time in a changing landscape without human intervention.</p>
                  <p>D. In addition to items A to C, when determining the location, type, function, and design of replacement, applicants and local government units must consider: landscape position, habitat requirements, development and habitat loss trends, sources of watershed impairment, protection and maintenance of upland resources and riparian areas, and providing a suite of functions.</p>

                  <p>A. Establishment or preservation of unmanicured vegetated upland buffer areas is required adjacent and contiguous to replacement wetlands receiving credit under part 8420.0526, subparts 3 to 7.</p>
                  <p>B. For replacement wetlands less than two acres in size, the buffer must be a minimum average width of 25 feet. For all other replacement wetlands, the buffer must be a minimum width of 25 feet and an average width of 50 feet.</p>
                  <p>C. The applicant may request the local government unit to vary the upland buffer standards under items A and B. The local government unit may vary the standards under items A and B based on a recommendation by the technical evaluation panel when compliance is not practicable or feasible, and the replacement wetland will otherwise meet the requirements of subpart 5, or when the variance would be ecologically beneficial.</p>

                  <p>A. Siting wetland replacement must follow this priority order:</p>
                  <p>(1) in the same minor watershed as the affected wetland;</p>
                  <p>(2) in the same major watershed as the affected wetland;</p>
                  <p>(3) in the same county as the affected wetland;</p>
                  <p>(4) for replacement by wetland banking, in the same wetland bank service area as the impacted wetland, except that impacts in a 50 to 80 percent area must be replaced in a 50 to 80 percent area and impacts in a less than 50 percent area must be replaced in a less than a 50 percent area; and</p>
                  <p>(5) for project-specific replacement, in an adjacent major watershed to the affected wetland or, for replacement by wetland banking, in an adjacent wetland bank service area, except that impacts in a 50 to 80 percent area must be replaced in a 50 to 80 percent area and impacts in a less than 50 percent area must be replaced in a less than 50 percent area.</p>
                  <p>B. Notwithstanding item A, siting wetland replacement in greater than 80 percent areas may follow the priority order under this item:</p>
                  <p>(1) by wetland banking after evaluating replacement within the minor and major watersheds;</p>
                  <p>(2) replaced in an adjacent wetland bank service area if wetland bank credits are not reasonably available in the same wetland bank service area as the affected wetland, as determined by a comprehensive inventory approved by the board; or</p>
                  <p>(3) statewide.</p>
                  <p>C. Notwithstanding item A, siting wetland replacement in the seven-county metropolitan area must follow the priority order under this item:</p>
                  <p>(1) in the affected county;</p>
                  <p>(2) in another of the seven metropolitan counties; or</p>
                  <p>(3) in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially within the seven-county metropolitan area, but at least one-to-one must be replaced within the seven-county metropolitan area.</p>
                  <p>D. Siting wetland replacement for public transportation projects must comply with part 8420.0544.</p>
                  <p>E. When reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities are not available in siting priorities listed in items A to D, the applicant may seek opportunities at the next level. For the purposes of this item, "reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities" means opportunities that are:</p>
                  <p>(1) ecologically suitable and sustainable according to subpart 5; and</p>
                  <p>(2) available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics consistent with overall project purposes. The cost of replacement credits alone is not sufficient reason to conclude that reasonable, practicable, or environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities are not available.</p>
                  <p>F. Regulatory agencies, local government units, and other entities involved in wetland restoration must collaborate to identify potential replacement opportunities in watersheds within their jurisdictional areas.</p>

                  <p>A. Replacement of wetland function and value must be completed in advance of or concurrent with the actual wetland impact. For replacement that is not in advance, a financial assurance is required according to subpart 9.</p>

                  <p>(1) approved wetland bank credits withdrawn before the impact; or</p>
                  <p>(2) project-specific replacement for which construction has been certified and the first monitoring report of the first full growing season following construction certification has been submitted according to part 8420.0810, and the replacement meets all goals and performance standards applicable to that development stage of the replacement site.</p>
                  <p>C. Any action being proposed for replacement credit must be specifically identified for replacement purposes and approved by the local government unit as part of a replacement or banking plan before the actual restoration or creation activity is initiated.</p>

                  <p>A. For wetland replacement that is not in advance, a financial assurance acceptable to the local government unit must be submitted to, and approved by, the local government unit to ensure successful replacement. The local government unit may waive this requirement if it determines the financial assurance is not necessary to ensure successful replacement. The local government unit may incorporate this requirement into any financial assurance required by the local government unit for other aspects of the project.</p>
                  <p>B. The financial assurance may be used to cover costs of actions necessary to bring the project into compliance with the approved replacement plan specifications and monitoring requirements. The financial assurance does not serve as an in-lieu fee and is not a substitute for enforcement, but may be used for repair, construction, vegetation establishment and management, maintenance, monitoring, or other actions the local government unit determines necessary to ensure adequate replacement.</p>
                  <p>C. Before drawing on the financial assurance, the local government unit must provide written notice to the landowner stating the actions necessary to bring the replacement project into compliance and that the landowner has 30 days to complete the actions, after which the local government unit will use the financial assurance to gain compliance. Use of the financial assurance by the local government unit may be appealed by the landowner within 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed, according to part 8420.0910.</p>
                  <p>D. The local government unit may release a portion of the financial assurance upon successful completion of construction, but must retain a sufficient amount to ensure successful vegetative establishment and completion of the monitoring requirements. Within 60 days of certification of successful replacement and completion of monitoring according to part 8420.0820, subpart 2, the local government unit must release any remaining financial assurance submitted by the applicant, provided all other conditions of the approval are met.</p>

                  <p>A. The actions in this part are eligible for replacement credit as determined by the local government unit in parts 8420.0500 to 8420.0820. Sufficient information to determine eligibility and credit must be provided to the local government unit as part of a replacement or banking plan application.</p>
                  <p>B. This part identifies the amount of credit allowed for each action, however, the actual amount may be less as determined by the local government unit. When the local government unit allows less replacement credit than the amounts described in this part, the local government unit must provide justification for the lower credit allocation.</p>
                  <p>C. Subparts 3 to 7 require the incorporation of buffer areas meeting the minimum requirements described in part 8420.0522, subpart 6.</p>
                  <p>D. Modification or conversion of nondegraded wetlands from one wetland type to another by damming, diking, impounding, or excavating does not constitute replacement credit. Restoration of wetlands drained or filled in violation of this chapter is not eligible for replacement credit. Wetlands impacted under an exemption may not be restored for replacement credit for ten years after the impact.</p>

                  <p>A. Up to ten percent of the buffer area is eligible for replacement credit for establishment or preservation of nonnative vegetation and up to 25 percent of the buffer area is eligible for replacement credit for establishment or preservation of native, noninvasive vegetation. Establishing upland buffer around existing high value wetlands adjacent to the replacement wetland is eligible for replacement credit only when the minimum widths provided in part 8420.0522, subpart 6, are maintained and the maximum buffer area under item B is not exceeded.</p>
                  <p>B. The area of buffer for which replacement credit is granted under item A must not exceed the area of the replacement wetland.</p>
                  <p>C. For buffer areas of native, noninvasive vegetation, the local government unit may increase the amount of credit to a maximum of 50 percent if the technical evaluation panel finds that additional buffer will improve replacement wetland sustainability and provide significant functional benefits. Buffers add to replacement wetland sustainability and provide significant functional benefits when they:</p>
                  <p>(1) extend upstream in the watershed, provide slope and soil stability, and otherwise protect and improve water quality;</p>
                  <p>(2) protect valuable native plant communities or habitats that could otherwise be lost or degraded;</p>
                  <p>(3) provide important habitat connections; or</p>
                  <p>(4) otherwise substantially improve important wetland functions based on a functional assessment and consideration of current and future adjacent land use.</p>

                  <p>B. Water control structures must be constructed using specifications provided in the Minnesota Wetland Restoration Guide or their equivalent. Control structures may be subject to the Department of Natural Resources dam safety regulations.</p>
                  <p>C. Best management practices must be established and maintained at the replacement site as necessary to protect the replacement wetland and other waterbodies. Erosion control measures must be employed during construction and until permanent ground cover is established.</p>
                  <p>D. Native, noninvasive vegetation must be established in restored and created wetlands. Each replacement or banking plan must include a vegetation establishment and management plan. The vegetation establishment and management plan must include a goal of, and specific provisions for, establishing plant communities that correspond to the hydrology and landscape position of the replacement site. If the replacement wetland is seeded or planted, the seed or planting stock should be from native, noninvasive species in accordance with the Minnesota Wetland Restoration Guide. In evaluating the vegetation establishment and management plan, the local government unit must determine that implementation of the plan is likely to result in establishment of the appropriate native, noninvasive vegetation within the monitoring period. During the monitoring period, the applicant must take reasonable steps to control invasion by any nonnative or invasive species.</p>
                  <p>E. The bottom contours of created types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands must provide a variety of water depths, comparable to natural wetlands in the vicinity of the replacement, and be consistent with part 8420.0522, subpart 5.</p>
                  <p>F. The edge of created or graded wetlands must be comparable to other naturally occurring wetlands of similar hydrologic condition and landscape position in the major watershed. Sideslopes of created wetlands, graded portions of restored wetlands, and graded buffer strips, must not be steeper than 8:1, eight feet horizontally for every one foot vertically, or flatter, unless the technical evaluation panel concurs that steeper slopes are acceptable based on the surrounding landscape and the characteristics of other naturally occurring wetlands in the vicinity. Sideslopes of 10:1 to 15:1 are preferred.</p>
                  <p>G. Treatment of runoff before discharge to replacement areas is required to improve sustainability and minimize degradation of the wetland over time. The replacement area must be physically separated from any water quality treatment system. "Treatment of runoff" under this part means:</p>
                  <p>(1) any part of a storm water treatment system needed to comply with water quality treatment requirements of state or local storm water permits or ordinances, provided the treatment system is physically separated from the replacement wetland; or</p>
                  <p>(2) when water quality treatment is not required by state or local permits or ordinances, the installation of appropriate best management practices, to the extent practicable and feasible, to protect long-term wetland function.</p>
                  <p>H. For projects that contain elements that include dams, dikes, or other impoundment features, the construction plans must be designed, overseen, and certified by a registered professional engineer.</p>

                  <p>The following replacement wetland design elements must be considered for replacement wetlands and incorporated to the extent practicable and feasible:</p>
                  <p>A. restored wetlands should emulate the hydrology and vegetation of the presettlement wetland condition;</p>
                  <p>B. expanded buffers should be incorporated into the design of replacement wetlands in areas where there is a high potential for erosion and the buffer will improve slope stability or when necessary to provide wildlife habitat corridor connections with other wetlands or habitats;</p>
                  <p>C. measures should be taken to manage hydraulic bounce as indicated in the guidance document under part 8420.0112, item N; and</p>
                  <p>D. for all restored wetlands where the original organic substrate has been stripped away and for all created wetlands, the organic substrate must be sufficient to establish a functioning wetland and to accomplish the goals of the replacement or banking plan. When feasible, organic soil used for backfill should be salvaged from the impacted wetland for utilization in the replacement wetland. Organic soil for backfill from wetlands dominated by nonnative or invasive species should be avoided.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>8420.<inline name="num">0544</inline> <b>REPLACEMENT FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>A. Impacts resulting from public transportation projects must be replaced according to the requirements of this chapter except as provided in this part.</p>
                <p>B. Wetlands impacted by public transportation projects:</p>
                <p>(1) outside the seven-county metropolitan area may be replaced statewide, except that impacts in less than 50 percent areas must be replaced in less than 50 percent areas; and</p>
                <p>(2) in the seven-county metropolitan area must be replaced in the seven-county metropolitan area or in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially within the seven-county metropolitan area, but at least one-to-one must be replaced within the seven-county metropolitan area.</p>
                <p>This item does not apply to replacement completed using wetland banking credits established by an applicant who submitted a complete wetland banking application to a local government unit by April 1, 1996.</p>
                <p>C. A replacement plan is required for public transportation projects that involve new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes.</p>
                <p>D. A replacement plan is not required for individual public road projects that impact wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the public road authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements. This item only applies to authorities for public road projects that:</p>
                <p>(1) minimize impacts associated with the project and consider replacing important site-specific wetland functions on site; and</p>
                <p>(2) provide project-specific plans and information, including project locations, wetland boundaries, amount and type of wetlands impacted, demonstration of impact minimization, and any changes or addenda, to the board's bank administrator, the technical evaluation panel, the commissioner, and members of the public requesting a copy:</p>
                <p>(a) at least 30 days before construction;</p>
                <p>(b) at an annual meeting of the parties required to receive notice, convened to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; or</p>
                <p>(c) within 30 days of commencing minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet.</p>
                <p>Public road authorities that do not follow the process required in this item for a project must submit a complete replacement plan application to the local government unit and provide for replacement of impacts associated with the project according to this chapter.</p>
                <p>E. For impacts associated with a new public road project, or a public road project expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, the public transportation authority may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish credits. Purchase of credits under this item is allowed only when the board has determined that sufficient credits are available for sale.</p>
                <p>F. The technical evaluation panel must review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public road authority and provide recommendations regarding on-site replacement if requested to do so by the local government unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the technical evaluation panel.</p>
                <p>G. Those required to receive notice of public road projects may appeal minimization, delineation, and on-site replacement decisions made by the public road authority to the board according to part 8420.0905.</p>
                <p>H. Changes to impacts proposed by local road authorities in item D must be reported to the board within six months from the date of the change being finalized.</p>
                <p>I. Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation is responsible, and public road authority projects that do not meet the requirements of item D, the board must replace public road project impacts, including impacts to public waters if authorized by the commissioner or a delegated authority, that result from local government projects on existing roads.</p>
                <p>J. Public road authorities, at their discretion, may deviate from federal and state design standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid impacts, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards for construction or reconstruction under this item. This item does not preclude an action for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.</p>

                <p>The purpose of parts 8420.0700 to 8420.0755 is to provide standards for the establishment and administration of a state wetland banking system, including individual wetland bank sites, as authorized by Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.2242. The purpose of the state wetland banking system is to provide a market-based structure that allows for replacement of unavoidable impacts with preestablished replacement wetlands. The board or the board's designee is responsible for management of the bank, including recording all bank transactions, maintaining bank records, and ensuring that the operation of the bank complies with parts 8420.0700 to 8420.0755.</p>

                  <p>Replacement wetland credits that result from any of the eligible actions in part 8420.0526, and that meet the standards of parts 8420.0522 and 8420.0528, may be deposited in the state wetland bank for later use in replacing unavoidable impacts. To be eligible for deposit in the bank, the credits must be specifically designated for wetland banking purposes prior to undertaking the replacement actions and certified by the local government unit prior to deposit. Designation of credits for wetland banking is accomplished by approval of a wetland banking plan by a local government unit. Replacement actions completed or initiated without prior local government unit approval are not eligible for deposit in the wetland bank.</p>

Based on a comprehensive local water or wetland protection and management plan approved by the board, a local government unit may, by rule or ordinance, limit the establishment of bank sites within its jurisdiction. The local government unit that approves a banking plan application is responsible for construction certification according to part 8420.0800, ensuring the monitoring provisions of part 8420.0810 are fulfilled, and certifying credits for deposit according to part 8420.0725.</p>
                  <p>B. The board may reject or modify an application for deposit if, during its review, any part of the bank application or plan is missing, incorrect, or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>

                  <p>When replacement actions are proposed for banking purposes, the applicant must submit to the local government unit a banking plan application, in a form prescribed by the board, containing the information identified in parts 8420.0305, item B, and 8420.0330, subpart 3, item B, and other information required by the board. The banking plan must also contain specific performance standards and a proposed credit release schedule based upon achievement of those standards. The local government unit is responsible for ensuring that a copy of the banking plan application is sent to the administrator of the state wetland bank, to the St. Paul District Office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and to those required to receive a copy of an application in part 8420.0255, subpart 3. The technical evaluation panel must review the banking plan application and may recommend changes or additions to the performance standards and credit allocation schedule. The wetland banking plan applicant must be advised of any panel recommendations. Based on the panel's findings and recommendations and other comments received, the local government unit must determine the likelihood that the replacement actions will be successful and approve, approve with modifications, or deny the banking plan application.</p>

                  <p>When a banking plan applicant wishes to use a portion of the credits generated from a banking project for project-specific replacement, the banking plan must identify the project-specific impact and the amount of credits to be used according to a corresponding replacement plan. The credits must meet the requirements of parts 8420.0500 to 8420.0528 and the approved replacement plan, and be deducted before deposit of any credits into the state wetland bank.</p>

                  <p>No credits may be deposited in the state wetland bank until a perpetual conservation easement, in a format prescribed by the board, is granted to and accepted by the state. The easement must encompass the entire replacement area, unless the local government unit and the board approve an alternate boundary at the time of bank application approval. The easement must provide for preservation of the banked wetland's functions by the fee owner and wetland banking plan applicant. The wetland banking plan applicant must also provide a title insurance policy that is acceptable to the state naming the state of Minnesota as the insured. If the conservation easement does not abut a public road, the fee owner and wetland banking plan applicant must also grant and record an access easement in favor of the board; the local government unit; and any other state, local, or federal regulatory authority that has authorized use of credits from the site for wetland replacement. The access easement does not confer a right of access to the general public. The boundary of bank areas must be clearly marked as prescribed in the conservation easement. This subpart does not apply to state land.</p>

                <p><shortTitle>8420.<inline name="num">0725</inline> <b>CERTIFICATION AND DEPOSIT OF CREDITS.</b></shortTitle></p>
                <p>A. To be deposited into the state wetland bank, replacement credits must be certified for deposit by the local government unit in which they are located. Certification of credits by the local government unit is requested by the banking plan applicant and may occur at any time during the monitoring period. The certification must be based on the findings and recommendation of the technical evaluation panel and must identify the area by type, area of buffer, and credits eligible for deposit. The technical evaluation panel must ensure that sufficient time has passed for the wetland to become established, especially vegetation and hydrology, before recommending certification. The area certified must be based on a land survey or comparable method of field measurement. The person making the measurement must verify in writing as to the method and accuracy of the measurement. Failure to follow the approved construction specifications or vegetation management plan is sufficient grounds for the local government unit to deny certification of credits for deposit.</p>
                <p>B. The certification and request for deposit of credits must be in a form prescribed by the board and must contain the following information:</p>
                <p>(1) name, address, and telephone number of the banking plan applicant;</p>
                <p>(2) a complete copy of the banking plan application and local government unit approval, supporting documents, and a legal boundary survey of the land area that will be subject to restrictions (for initial deposit only);</p>
                <p>(3) a copy of the deed for the property containing the wetland and any easement if the banking plan applicant is not the fee owner (for initial deposit only);</p>
                <p>(4) a copy of the recorded conservation easement according to part 8420.0705, subpart 5;</p>
                <p>(5) amount of replacement credit to be deposited, to the square foot, by wetland type;</p>
                <p>(6) technical evaluation panel recommendation and local government unit certification; and</p>
                <p>(7) other information required by the board.</p>
                <p>C. Up to 15 percent of the credits proposed for banking are eligible for deposit in the bank immediately after the certification of construction according to part 8420.0820, subpart 2, and recording of a conservation easement according to part 8420.0705, subpart 5.</p>
                <p>D. After the initial deposit, the remaining credits proposed for banking are eligible for deposit in accordance with the credit release schedule and performance standards included in the approved banking plan, subject to review by the technical evaluation panel and certification by the local government unit. If the approved banking plan does not contain a credit release schedule and associated performance standards, remaining credits will be eligible for deposit based on the findings and recommendation of the technical evaluation panel regarding the success of the proposed replacement action.</p>
                <p>E. After certifying the credits for deposit, the local government unit must forward the signed request for deposit form to the board's banking administrator. No credits will be deposited until receipt of the completed and approved request to deposit form by the board. The board must acknowledge the deposit to the banking plan applicant and local government unit and enter the information in item B into the wetland bank.</p>
                <p>F. If the banking plan applicant chooses not to proceed with the initial deposit, the banking plan applicant may return the site to its preconstruction condition without replacement. If credits have been deposited but none have been withdrawn, the banking plan applicant may request the board vacate the conservation easement at the applicant's expense. If the board vacates the conservation easement, the account will be closed and the site may be returned to preconstruction condition without replacement. Replacement areas wholly or partially deposited into the bank, on which withdrawals have occurred or which otherwise have been used for replacement, are subject to this chapter, including replacement for any subsequent impacts.</p>

                  <p>A. If, during the monitoring period, the local government unit or the technical evaluation panel determines that a bank site does not meet the specifications in the approved banking plan, the local government unit must require corrective actions and notify the board's banking administrator. The board may restrict further deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of all credits associated with the bank site until the local government unit and the board, based on findings from the technical evaluation panel, determine that the banking project has been brought into compliance.</p>
                  <p>B. If, after the monitoring period, the board determines that wetlands deposited into the bank are not in compliance with the conditions of the conservation easement, the board must require corrective actions of the fee owner or banking plan applicant to bring the bank site into compliance with easement conditions.</p>
                  <p>C. If satisfactory remediation does not result under item A or B, the local government unit or the board may undertake reconstruction work to bring the site into compliance. Alternatively, when credits have not been withdrawn or transferred, the board may vacate the conservation and access easement and close the account. The board and local government unit may require reimbursement of reasonable costs of bringing the site into compliance or vacating the conservation and access easement.</p>
                  <p>D. Fee owners, banking plan applicants, or account holders may appeal restrictions on credit deposits, withdrawals, and transfers or demands for reimbursement of reconstruction costs to the board.</p>

                  <p>Replacement plan applicants seeking to use banking credits for replacement are responsible for contacting and arranging for acquisition of the credits from the holder of a bank account according to the wetland replacement requirements of this chapter. The board shall supply information on wetland bank sites according to part 8420.0755, subpart 1, item B. Replacement plan applicants proposing the use of bank credits for replacement must complete a credit withdrawal form prescribed by the board and include it as part of the replacement plan application submitted to the local government unit. If the local government unit approves the use of bank credits for replacement, the local government unit must sign the credit withdrawal form and notify the board's banking administrator according to part 8420.0255, subpart 5. The board shall not withdraw credits from a bank account unless a regulatory entity with authority over the use of the credits has approved the use of the subject credits for replacement of a specific wetland impact. Local government unit approval of replacement plans involving the use of banking credits is conditional upon withdrawal of the credits by the board. Impacts under replacement plans must not occur until the board has notified the replacement plan applicant that the credits have been withdrawn.</p>

                  <p>A. Monitoring of replacement wetlands is the responsibility of the landowner of the property where the replacement wetland is located. Any agreement to transfer monitoring responsibilities from the landowner to a local government unit or other party must be in writing and signed by both parties and does not release the applicant from the responsibility to provide replacement as specified in the approved replacement plan.</p>
                  <p>B. For project-specific replacement in which the wetland impact site occurs in a different local government unit from the replacement site, the local government unit for the impact site may assume the monitoring enforcement responsibility for the replacement site upon written agreement between the local government units.</p>

                  <p>A. Monitoring may, at the discretion of the local government unit, begin upon construction certification, but must begin no later than the first full growing season following construction certification. Monitoring must continue for five full growing seasons or until the local government unit determines, with the concurrence of the technical evaluation panel, that the replacement is successful, but in no case may the determination be made before the end of the third full growing season.</p>
                  <p>B. If the goals of the approved plan have not been achieved after the fifth season of monitoring but, in the written opinion of the technical evaluation panel, may be achieved with more time, the local government unit may, through written notification of the applicant, extend the monitoring period for not more than an additional five growing seasons. The local government unit's notification of extension must specify the reasons for the extension and any corrective actions necessary to bring the replacement wetland into compliance with the approved plan.</p>
                  <p>C. For project-specific replacement plans, if the local government unit determines that, at any time during the monitoring period and based on the recommendation of the technical evaluation panel, the goals of the approved replacement plan have not been achieved, and will not be achieved with more time, the local government unit must pursue one or more corrective actions identified in part 8420.0820, subpart 1.</p>

                  <p>A. Following the first full growing season after construction certification, the applicant must submit annual monitoring reports documenting the progress of the replacement wetland during the monitoring period. The first annual monitoring report must include any monitoring required by the local government unit during the previous year. The applicant must submit the annual report to the appropriate local government unit on a date determined by the local government unit, but no later than December 31. The local government unit must ensure that copies of the monitoring report are distributed to the technical evaluation panel. For wetland banking projects, the applicant must also submit the annual report to the board's wetland banking administrator. The monitoring reports must be submitted annually, or biannually if the local government unit determines that, after the third full growing season, biannual reports are sufficient for long-term monitoring, until the local government unit determines the replacement has been successful.</p>
                  <p>B. The purpose of the annual report is to describe actual wetland restoration or creation activities completed during the past year, activities planned for the upcoming year, and the success of the replacement activities in achieving identified goals and performance standards. The annual report must, at a minimum, include:</p>
                  <p>(1) a project location map with legal description;</p>
                  <p>(2) a description of replacement wetland goals and performance standards in terms of size, replacement credit amount, wetland types, hydrology, and wetland functions and a comparison of the current replacement wetland to these goals and standards;</p>

                  <p>(4) a description of activities planned for the upcoming year;</p>
                  <p>(5) hydrology measurements during the growing season, including water level elevations at fixed, repeatable locations representative of the replacement wetland types or areal coverage measurements of inundation for replacement wetlands with deeper hydrologic regimes;</p>
                  <p>(6) a map of plant communities within the boundaries of the replacement site, including estimates of square footage or acreage of each and identification of areas of invasive or nonnative vegetation;</p>
                  <p>(7) color photographs of all replacement areas taken during the growing season from fixed, repeatable reference locations that are representative of each plant community type;</p>
                  <p>(8) a delineation and survey of the replacement wetland areas, if applicable, for the final monitoring season; and</p>
                  <p>(9) other information specified in the approved monitoring plan or subsequently requested by the local government unit.</p>

                  <p>B. For project-specific replacement, if the local government unit determines that the goals of the approved replacement plan will not be met, it must take one or more of the following actions:</p>
                  <p>(1) order specific corrective actions on the replacement wetlands;</p>
                  <p>(2) order the applicant to prepare and implement a new or revised replacement plan;</p>
                  <p>(3) request the enforcement authority to issue a cease and desist order on the wetland impact activity if it has not been completed;</p>
                  <p>(4) request the local soil and water conservation district and enforcement authority to order restoration of the impacted wetland;</p>

                  <p>C. If the landowner fails to submit the annual report associated with a project-specific replacement plan in accordance with part 8420.0810, the local government unit responsible for monitoring oversight must either pursue enforcement actions under item B or prepare the annual report for the applicant. The local government unit may charge fees for preparing the report or use any financial assurance the applicant had provided to complete monitoring requirements.</p>

                  <p>A. As an alternative to the rules adopted under Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.2242, subdivision 1, and the public value criteria established or approved under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.3355, a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan may be developed by a local government unit, or one or more local government units operating under a joint powers agreement, provided that the requirements of this part are met. This part provides minimum standards. Local government units may require equivalent or more stringent standards and procedures for wetland conservation, but not less stringent standards and procedures.</p>
                  <p>B. The ultimate goal of a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan is to maintain and improve the quality, quantity, and biological diversity of wetland resources within watersheds through the prioritization of existing wetlands and the strategic selection of replacement sites. The purpose of developing a plan is to provide a watershed and ecosystem-based framework to make wetland impact and replacement decisions that meet state standards and locally identified goals and support the sustainability or improvement of wetland resources in watersheds while providing local flexibility as allowed under subpart 4.</p>
                  <p>C. Any local government unit opting to pursue development of a plan and incorporating this chapter into local ordinance must provide documentation to the board demonstrating local capacity to implement the plan.</p>

                  <p>To maximize effectiveness, the comprehensive wetland protection and management plan should be developed as part of, or in coordination with, other relevant local or regional plans and requirements.

                  <p>To the extent practical and feasible, the comprehensive wetland protection and management plan should be based on watershed boundaries. The size of watershed addressed should not be larger than is appropriate to ensure that the wetland resources provided through replacement will effectively compensate for approved impacts. For local governments with multiple watersheds, a separate analysis should be completed for each watershed substantially within the local government's jurisdiction. Local governments should consider joint planning efforts for those watersheds that cross political boundaries.</p>

                  <p>The comprehensive wetland protection and management component of the local water plan may:</p>
                  <p>A. vary application of the sequencing standards in part 8420.0520, for projects based on the classification and criteria in the plan;</p>
                  <p>B. vary the replacement standards of part 8420.0522, subparts 3 to 9, and the actions eligible for credit under part 8420.0526, based on the classification and criteria in the plan, so long as there is no net loss of public value within the area subject to the plan and so long as:</p>
                  <p>(1) in a 50 to 80 percent area, a minimum acreage requirement of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of impacted wetland requiring replacement is met within the area subject to the plan; and</p>
                  <p>(2) in a less than 50 percent area, a minimum acreage requirement of two acres of replaced wetland for each acre of impacted wetland requiring replacement is met within the area subject to the plan;</p>

                  <p>A. The comprehensive wetland protection and management plan must include the establishment of watershed goals based on an analysis of the existing ecological conditions of the plan area and the development of corresponding goals for maintaining and improving those conditions. The ecological condition of the plan area should be based on inventories of historic and existing wetland resources, including identification of degraded wetlands, existing high-quality wetlands, and immediate and long-term resource needs within the plan area. The analysis may be completed as part of the comprehensive wetland protection and management plan or adopted from a relevant local or regional water plan, if one exists.</p>
                  <p>B. The plan may provide for the classification of wetlands in the plan area based on:</p>
                  <p>(1) an inventory of existing wetlands in the plan area;</p>
                  <p>(2) an assessment of the wetland functions listed in part 8420.0522, subpart 1, using a methodology chosen by the technical evaluation panel and based on one of the methodologies established or approved by the board;</p>
                  <p>(3) landscape position, adjacent habitats or buffers, connectivity with or between important resources, projected land use, and other watershed-scale criteria; and</p>
                  <p>(4) the resulting public value.</p>
                  <p>C. The plan must include an inventory and prioritization of replacement sites based on an analysis of the types and locations of replacement projects that will provide the desired wetland functions, benefit the watershed from a landscape perspective, and best offset losses of public value caused by approved impacts. The goal of the analysis is to provide a framework from which replacement actions and locations will provide the greatest value to the public based on the ecological needs of the watershed. Priority should be given to naturally self-sustaining replacement that best achieves watershed goals and improves the ecological condition of the watershed. The plan must include strategies for the promotion and establishment of high-priority replacement sites that best meet the goals of the plan.</p>
                  <p>D. Comprehensive wetland protection and management plans developed as part of county, watershed district, or watershed management organization plan may identify those areas that qualify as high-priority areas for wetland preservation, enhancement, restoration, and establishment according to part 8420.0835.</p>
                  <p>E. The plan must include a provision for periodic assessment of the effectiveness of the plan, and the local government unit's implementation of it, in achieving plan goals. Updates to previously approved plans must include an analysis of the effectiveness of the previous plan, including the identification of barriers to achieving identified goals and development of strategies to overcome them.</p>
                  <p>F. The plan must specify the period covered by the plan, which must extend at least five years but not more than ten years from the date the board approves the plan.</p>

                  <p>A. A notice of intent to plan must be sent, at the beginning of the planning process, to the technical evaluation panel, the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Agriculture, the Pollution Control Agency, watershed management organizations within the plan area, local government units within and adjacent to the plan area, and the St. Paul district office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers with an invitation to actively participate in the development of the plan. The notice should also include a general description of the planning effort, the planning area, and an anticipated timeline.</p>
                  <p>B. The technical evaluation panel must be consulted in all components of plan and ordinance development, including conducting wetland functional assessments, establishing wetland management classifications and standards, prioritizing replacement sites, and identifying local reference standard wetlands.</p>
                  <p>C. The local government unit must implement a process for notifying and involving local citizens in the development of the plan and determination of local value. Local citizen involvement may include the formation of a citizen's advisory committee or utilization of other existing citizen groups.</p>
                  <p>D. Upon completion, the local government unit must submit the draft comprehensive wetland protection and management plan and ordinance or rule for a 60-day review and comment period to those required to receive notice under item A. The local government unit must respond in writing, within 30 days of the end of the review period, to any comments received during the review period.</p>
                  <p>E. The local government unit must conduct a public hearing on the plan no sooner than 30 days after the end of the 60-day review period but before submitting the final draft plan to the board for approval.</p>
                  <p>F. After conducting the public hearing but before final adoption, the local government unit must submit the plan and ordinance or rule, all written comments received, a record of the public hearing, and a summary of responses to comments and changes incorporated as a result of the review process to the board for review under subpart 7.</p>
                  <p>G. An organization that is invited to participate in the development of the draft local plan, but declines to do so or fails to participate or to provide written comments during the local review process, waives the right during the review under item D to submit comments, except comments concerning consistency of the plan with laws and rules administered by that agency. In determining the merit of an agency comment, the board must consider the involvement of the agency in the development of the local plan.</p>
                  <p>H. Except as otherwise provided for in this part, all other requirements relating to development of the plan must be consistent with the local water plan processes under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.231, 103B.311, or 103D.401. A plan developed as part of a local water management plan may follow the review and approval process applicable to the local water management plan instead of the review and approval process under items D to F.</p>

                  <p>A. The board shall make a decision to approve or disapprove a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan within 60 days of receipt of a complete and final draft of the plan and ordinance or rule as required in subpart 6, item F. The board may disapprove all or parts of the plan if the board determines the plan does not meet the requirements of this part. If the board has not made a decision within 60 days of receipt of the final plan, the plan is deemed approved. The 60-day period may be extended upon mutual agreement of the board and the local government unit.</p>
                  <p>B. In its review of a plan, the board must advise the local government unit of those elements of the plan that are more restrictive than this chapter and the act.</p>
                  <p>C. If the board disagrees with the plan or any elements of the plan, the board shall, in writing, notify the local government unit of the plan deficiencies and suggested changes. The board must include in the response to the local government unit the scientific justification, if applicable, for the board's concerns with the plan. Upon receipt of the board's concerns with the plan, the local government unit has 60 days to revise the plan and resubmit the plan to the board for reconsideration, or the local government unit may request a hearing before the board. The board must hold a hearing within the boundaries of the jurisdiction of the local government within 60 days of the request for hearing. After the hearing, the board must, within 60 days, prepare a report of its decision and inform the local government unit.</p>
                  <p>D. If, after the hearing, the board and local government unit disagree on the plan, the board must, within 60 days, initiate mediation through a neutral party. If the board and local government unit agree in writing not to use mediation or the mediation does not result in a resolution of the differences between the parties, then the board may commence a declaratory judgment action in the district court of the county where the local government unit is located. If the board does not commence a declaratory judgment action within the applicable 60-day period, the plan is deemed approved.</p>
                  <p>E. The declaratory judgment action must be commenced within 60 days after the date of the written agreement not to use mediation or 60 days after conclusion of the mediation. If the board commences a declaratory judgment action, the district court must review the board's record of decision and the record of decision of the local government unit. The district court must affirm the plan if it meets the requirements of this part.</p>

                  <p>A. The comprehensive wetland protection and management plan is effective after approval by the board as provided in subpart 7 and after adoption of the plan into the official controls of the local government unit.</p>
                  <p>B. Comprehensive wetland protection and management plans remain in effect according to subpart 5, item F, unless revised according to subpart 6 and approved by the board. Plans that contain revision dates inconsistent with this part must comply with the plan's date if the date is not more than ten years beyond the date of board approval. An extension of the revision date of the plan may be granted by the board.</p>
                  <p>C. All amendments to the adopted plan and ordinance are effective upon completion of the same process required for the original plan, except when the proposed amendments constitute minor amendments and:</p>
                  <p>(1) a public hearing has been held to explain the amendments;</p>
                  <p>(2) the local government unit has sent copies of the amendments to those required to receive notice under subpart 6; and</p>
                  <p>(3) the board has either agreed that the amendments are minor or failed to act within 60 days of receipt of the amendments.</p>
                  <p>D. For the purposes of this subpart, "minor amendments" include clarifications, updates to wetland or replacement site inventories, and other changes that do not substantially alter the standards of the approved plan and ordinance or rule, as determined by the board. Amendments required to bring the plan into conformance with revisions to this chapter are also considered minor.</p>

                  <p>A. Water management plans prepared by water management organizations in the metropolitan area under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.231, by counties outside the metropolitan area under Minnesota Statutes, section 103B.311, and by watershed districts outside the metropolitan area under Minnesota Statutes, sections 103D.401 and 103D.405, may identify those areas that qualify as high-priority areas for wetland preservation, enhancement, restoration, and establishment. To designate a high-priority area, the preservation, enhancement, restoration, and establishment of wetlands must have or achieve high public value based on the functions of wetlands listed in part 8420.0522, subpart 1, and the goals of the water management plan.</p>
                  <p>B. High-priority areas should be designated by minor watershed or subwatershed. Strong consideration should be given to identifying as high-priority areas minor watersheds that have less than 50 percent of their original wetland acreages and where restoration of previously impacted or degraded wetlands will contribute toward achieving watershed-based goals. Consideration should also be given to watersheds that contain high-valued wetlands that are at risk of degradation or loss, the protection of which is integral to maintaining the ecology and condition of the watershed. Identification of high-priority watersheds should be consistent with part 8420.0830, subpart 5, item A.</p>
                  <p>C. Local water plans may identify individual wetlands, or criteria to establish individual wetlands, as high-priority areas. Individual wetlands identified as high-priority areas should be of high local value, at risk of degradation or loss, and consistent with any existing wetland classification criteria established under part 8420.0830, subpart 5, items A and B. Plans may also identify individual sites as high-priority areas for wetland restoration and establishment. High-priority restoration sites should be identified according to the criteria in part 8420.0830, subpart 5, items A and C.</p>
                  <p>D. Local water plans that identify high-priority areas and intend to accept applications for wetland preservation areas under part 8420.0840 should include criteria for eligibility and prioritization of applications.</p>
                  <p>E. The board shall review the inclusion of high-priority areas in plans as part of the standard process for plan review. High-priority areas approved by the board that are not in a high-priority region under subpart 1 become high-priority regions with board approval.</p>

Wetlands located in high-priority areas as identified in part 8420.0835 and a local water plan are eligible for enrollment as wetland preservation areas. A wetland so enrolled is exempt from property tax. Sites identified as high-priority areas for wetland restoration and establishment are eligible for wetland preservation area designation only after restoration of the wetland. Wetland areas receiving replacement credit are not eligible for designation as a wetland preservation area.</p>

                  <p>A landowner may apply to the county or watershed district, if the county or watershed district chooses to accept wetland preservation areas, for designation of a wetland as a wetland preservation area on forms provided by the board. The applicant must include a buffer strip that meets the minimum width requirements of part 8420.0522, subpart 6, around the perimeter of the wetland. The applicant may include up to four acres of upland for each acre of wetland. The application must be accompanied by a restrictive covenant on a form provided by the board. The covenant must contain the same limitations on use that are provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 103F.515, subdivision 4, including a covenant that the enrolled upland area must be vegetated by the landowner to permanent vegetation other than noxious weeds. The covenant must be signed, acknowledged, and ready for recording.</p>

                  <p>Upon receipt of a complete application, the county or watershed district must send a copy of the application to the county assessor, the board, and the soil and water conservation district where the land is located. The soil and water conservation district must prepare an advisory statement of existing and potential preservation problems or conflicts and send the statement to the owner of record and to the county or watershed district. The county or watershed district may accept the application if the wetland is in a high-priority region and high-priority area, the application provides for the minimum required buffer strip, and the application is accompanied by the proper covenant. The county or watershed district may limit or reject additional upland proposed to be included according to criteria identified in the approved plan and standards the county may establish. The county or watershed district may reject the application if the application does not qualify or may require modification and resubmittal of the application. If the application qualifies, the county or watershed district may approve it and mark the date of approval on the application. The county or watershed district must notify the landowner of the acceptance or denial of the application within 60 days from the date of the application. Within five business days of approval of the application, the county or watershed district must forward it to the county recorder for recording of the restrictive covenant or memorialization of the application on the certificate of title. The county or watershed district must also send a copy of the approved application to the county assessor for entry in the assessor's records as a wetland preservation area. The county or watershed district must also send copies of the approved application to the soil and water conservation district, the local government unit, and the board.</p>

                  <p>A. Cease and desist orders may be issued when the enforcement authority has probable cause that an activity is being or will again be conducted that impacts a wetland, does not qualify for no-loss or an exemption under parts 8420.0415 and 8420.0420, and is being or will again be conducted without prior approval of a replacement plan by a local government unit under part 8420.0255 or involving a decision stayed by the board pursuant to part 8420.0905.</p>
                  <p>B. A cease and desist order must not be issued if the landowner:</p>
                  <p>(1) has, and is complying with, a valid replacement plan, exemption, or no-loss approved by the local government unit or a completed and submitted public road project notification that has not been stayed, remanded, or reversed on appeal under part 8420.0905; or</p>
                  <p>(2) has sufficient evidence to support qualification for an exemption or no-loss.</p>
                  <p>C. The enforcement authority must advise the landowner that the landowner's written application, if any, for a replacement plan, exemption, or no-loss should be made immediately to the local government unit and that any wetland that has been impacted may require restoration if the application for replacement plan, exemption, or no-loss is denied or reversed on appeal. The enforcement authority issuing a cease and desist order must promptly submit copies to the soil and water conservation district, local government unit, and Department of Natural Resources.</p>
                  <p>D. If an application for a replacement plan, exemption, or no-loss approval is triggered by a cease and desist order, the local government unit must make the decision according to part 8420.0255 and the standards and application procedures applicable to the type of application.</p>
                  <p>E. If the decision is that the activity is exempt or qualifies as a no-loss, the local government unit must request that the enforcement authority rescind the cease and desist order, pending the outcome of any appeal, and notify the soil and water conservation district, the enforcement authority, and the landowner.</p>
                  <p>F. If the application is denied, the local government unit must immediately notify the soil and water conservation district, the enforcement authority, and the landowner.</p>
                  <p>G. In cases where the cease and desist order has been issued to a local government unit, the decision of exemption or no-loss must be made by the board.</p>

                  <p>A. The enforcement authority must issue a restoration order or replacement order when:</p>
                  <p>(1) the impact has already been completed when discovered or, after a cease and desist order has been issued, the landowner does not apply for a replacement plan, exemption, or no-loss within three weeks;</p>

                  <p>(3) the local government unit denies the application.</p>
                  <p>B. Promptly upon being informed by the enforcement authority or the local government unit of the need, a soil and water conservation district staff person must inspect the site and prepare a plan in consultation with the local government unit and the enforcement authority for restoring the site to its prealtered condition. The soil and water conservation district may request assistance from the local government unit or technical evaluation panel in inspecting the site and preparing the plan. Restoration must be ordered unless the technical evaluation panel concludes that restoration is not possible or prudent. The soil and water conservation district must incorporate its plan into a restoration or replacement order and send it to the enforcement authority for service in person or by certified mail to the landowner or responsible party.</p>

                  <p>A. A restoration order must specify dates by which the landowner or responsible party must:</p>
                  <p>(1) restore the wetland according to the soil and water conservation district plan and obtain a certificate of satisfactory restoration from the soil and water conservation district; or</p>
                  <p>(2) submit a complete replacement plan, exemption, or no-loss application to the local government unit.</p>
                  <p>B. If an application submitted under item A, subitem (2), is denied, the landowner or responsible party must restore the wetland as specified in the order.</p>
                  <p>C. The restoration order must be rescinded if the landowner or responsible party obtains approval of an after-the-fact replacement plan, exemption, or no-loss from the local government unit that is not reversed on appeal.</p>
                  <p>D. A replacement order must specify a date by which the landowner or responsible party must submit a complete replacement plan application to the local government unit and a subsequent date by which the landowner or responsible party must replace the wetland according to the approved replacement plan and obtain a certificate of satisfactory replacement from the soil and water conservation district. The restoration or replacement order must specify a time period of at least 30 days for submittal of a complete application under this subpart.</p>
                  <p>E. If a complete application is not submitted within the time period specified in the restoration order, or as properly extended, the landowner or responsible party must restore the wetland as specified in the order before submitting an application under item A, subitem (2), unless the local government unit and the enforcement authority agree otherwise or unless allowed under appeal.</p>
                  <p>F. A certificate of satisfactory restoration or replacement may be issued with conditions that must be met in the future, such as for issues with wetland vegetation, weed control, inspections, monitoring, or hydrology. Failure to fully comply with any conditions that have been specified may result in the issuance of a new restoration or replacement order.</p>

                  <p>A. If the technical evaluation panel determines that restoration will not restore all the loss caused by the impact, the order may require a combination of restoration and replacement or may require replacement rather than restoration. The order must direct the landowner or responsible party to obtain replacement plan approval from the local government unit. The order must specify that if replacement plan approval is not obtained, the landowner or responsible party must restore the wetland as ordered.</p>
                  <p>B. Each cease and desist, restoration, and replacement order must state that violation of the order is a misdemeanor.</p>
                  <p>C. If, as part of a misdemeanor proceeding, the court orders restoration or replacement, the technical evaluation panel must determine which is appropriate, and if it is restoration, the method of restoration. If the court orders replacement, the landowner or responsible party must follow the replacement plan process under subpart 6 and part 8420.0330, and the wetland replacement, construction, and monitoring requirements of this chapter.</p>

A decision made by local government unit staff is final if not appealed to the local government unit within 30 days after the date on which the decision is sent to those required to receive notice of the decision. Notwithstanding the time frames of Minnesota Statutes, section 15.99, or any other law to the contrary, the local government unit must make a ruling within 30 days from the date of the filing of the appeal, unless the appellant and local government unit mutually agree, in writing, to an extension of time beyond the 30 days.</p>
                  <p>B. Appeal of a final decision made by staff may be made by the landowner, by any of those required to receive notice of the decision, or by 100 residents of the county in which a majority of the wetland is located.</p>
                  <p>C. An appeal is effective upon mailing the petition and payment of any applicable fees to the local government unit. A filing fee is not required for appeals petitioned by state agencies or members of the technical evaluation panel.</p>

                  <p>A. The decision of a local government unit to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application is final if not appealed to the board within 30 days after the date on which the decision is sent to those required to receive notice of the decision unless the applicant and local government unit mutually agree, in writing, to an extension of time beyond the 30 days. Appeals of decisions made by local government staff must be made to the local government unit as provided for in subpart 2. This subpart also applies to decisions made under comprehensive wetland protection and management plans.</p>
                  <p>B. Appeal may be made by the landowner, by any of those required to receive notice of the decision, or by 100 residents of the county in which a majority of the wetland is located.</p>
                  <p>C. An appeal is effective upon mailing the petition and payment of a nonrefundable filing fee in an amount determined by the board, not to exceed $1,000, to the board with evidence that a copy of the petition has been mailed to the local government unit. The petition should include information to establish sufficient grounds for the appeal. The filing fee is not required for appeals petitioned by state agencies or members of the technical evaluation panel. Another filing fee is not required for appeals that have been remanded if the filing fee was paid and the same party appeals the new decision made under remand. After receipt of a petition, the local government unit must send a copy of the petition to all those to whom it was required to send a notice of the decision.</p>

                  <p><shortTitle>Subp. <inline name="num">4</inline>. <b>Board appeal procedures.</b></shortTitle></p>
                  <p>A. Within 30 days after receiving the petition, the board, its dispute resolution committee, or its executive director must decide whether to grant the petition and hear the appeal. After considering the size of the proposed impacts and the quality of the affected wetland, any patterns of similar acts by the petitioner or responsible party or by the local government unit in administration of this chapter and the act, and the consequences of the delay resulting from the appeal, the board, its dispute resolution committee, or its executive director shall grant the petition unless the appeal is deemed to be without sufficient merit, trivial, or brought solely for the purposes of delay; the petitioner has not exhausted all local administrative remedies; or the petitioner has not submitted the required filing fee.</p>
                  <p>B. The board, its dispute resolution committee, or its executive director may stay the local government unit decision until the appeal is resolved.</p>
                  <p>C. The board, its dispute resolution committee, or its executive director may remand the appealed decision back to the local government unit if the petitioner has not exhausted all local administrative remedies, such as a local government unit evidentiary public hearing, if expanded technical review is needed, or if the local government unit's record is not adequate. If an appeal is remanded, a new application is not required and additional information may be submitted before a decision is made by the local government unit. The local government unit must make a decision on an appeal that has been remanded within 60 days unless the remand order, or a subsequent order, specifies a longer period.</p>
                  <p>D. After the petition is granted, the appeal must be heard by the dispute resolution committee and decided by the board within 60 days after filing of the local government unit's written record, submittal of written briefs for the appeal, and a hearing by the dispute resolution committee. Parties to the appeal are the appellant, the landowner, the local government unit, and those required to receive notice of the local government unit decision.</p>
                  <p>E. The board or its executive director may elect to combine related appeals and process as one decision, either multiple appeals on the same project or appeals of different local government unit decisions on the same project.</p>
                  <p>F. Within 30 days of the grant of the appeal, unless an extension of time is approved by the board, the local government unit must forward to the board the written record on which it based its decision. The board must forward one copy of the record to each of the parties to the appeal. The board shall make its decision on the appeal after hearing. The board must give the parties 30 days' notice of the hearing. The board must base its review on the record and the argument presented to the board by the parties. However, if the local government unit did not consider fundamental information, such as aerial photographs, soil maps, or wetland maps, or did not make formal findings contemporaneously with its decision; if there is not accurate verbatim transcript of the proceedings; if the proceedings were not fairly conducted; or if the record is otherwise incomplete or deficient, the board may remand the matter or receive additional evidence. If, before the date set for the hearing, application is made to the board for leave to present additional evidence on the issues in the case and it is shown to the satisfaction of the board that additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the local government unit, the board may order that the additional evidence be taken before the local government unit upon such conditions that the board deems proper. The local government unit may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and must file with the board, to become a part of the record, the additional evidence, together with any modifications or new findings or decision.</p>
                  <p>G. The board shall affirm the local government unit's decision if the local government unit's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous; if the local government unit correctly applied the law to the facts, including this chapter; and if the local government unit made no procedural errors prejudicial to a party. Otherwise, the board shall reverse the decision, amend it, or remand it with instructions for further proceedings. The board must provide notice of its decision to the parties to the appeal.</p>

A local government unit making a request under this subpart must provide the attorney general with a copy of the complaint as soon as possible after being served. If requested by the attorney general, the court must grant additional time to file an answer equal to the time between service of the complaint on the local government unit and receipt of the complaint by the attorney general.</p>

                  <p>A. An application for compensation under this part must identify the applicant, locate the wetland, and refer the board to its appeal file in the matter.</p>
                  <p>B. An application must include an agreement that, in exchange for compensation, the applicant shall convey to the state a perpetual conservation easement in the form required by Minnesota Statutes, section 103F.516. The applicant must provide an abstract of title demonstrating the ability to convey the easement free of any prior title, lien, or encumbrance. Failure to provide marketable title negates the state's obligation to compensate.</p>
                  <p>C. The applicant must submit official documentation from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the watershed district or water management organization, if any, the county, and the town or city, as applicable, that the proposed impact and the proposed subsequent use of the wetland are lawful under their respective legal requirements.</p>
                  <p>D. The landowner must demonstrate that the proposed impact is a feasible and prudent project and that the replacement plan as proposed is a reasonable good faith effort to fulfill the wetland replacement, construction, and monitoring requirements of this chapter and the act.</p>
                  <p>E. If the replacement plan was approved, but with conditions or modifications, the applicant must show that the conditions or modifications make the replacement unworkable or not feasible. A plan is unworkable or not feasible if the replacement must be on land that the applicant does not own, the applicant has made good faith efforts to acquire a replacement site and not succeeded, and there is not a qualifying replacement available in a wetland bank. A plan is also unworkable or not feasible if it is not possible to carry out for engineering reasons. The applicant must show that forgoing the proposed project will cause the applicant damages and that disallowing the proposed use will enhance the public value of the wetland.</p>
                  <p>F. The applicant must submit to the board the requirements in this part in writing, by certified mail. The applicant must indicate on the application whether the applicant wants to make oral argument to the board. The board may require that the applicant appear before the board.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of this part is to provide minimum standards and criteria for identifying, protecting, and managing calcareous fens as authorized by Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.223. Calcareous fens, as identified by the commissioner, must not be impacted or otherwise altered or degraded, wholly or partially, by any action, unless the commissioner, under an approved management plan, decides some alteration is necessary. The exemptions under part 8420.0420 and the sequencing provisions under part 8420.0520 do not apply to calcareous fens.</p>

                  <p>A calcareous fen is a peat-accumulating wetland dominated by distinct groundwater inflows having specific chemical characteristics. The water is characterized as circumneutral to alkaline, with high concentrations of calcium and low dissolved oxygen content. The chemistry provides an environment for specific and often rare hydrophytic plants.</p>
