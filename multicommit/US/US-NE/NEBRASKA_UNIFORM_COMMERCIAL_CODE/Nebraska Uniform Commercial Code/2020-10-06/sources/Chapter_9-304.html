			Law governing perfection and priority
of security interests in deposit accounts.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a) The local
law of a bank's jurisdiction governs perfection, the effect of perfection
or nonperfection, and the priority of a security interest in a deposit account
maintained with that bank.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(b) The following rules determine a bank's jurisdiction for purposes
of this part:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(1) If an agreement between the bank and its
customer governing the deposit account expressly provides that
a particular jurisdiction is the bank's jurisdiction for purposes of this
part, this article, or the Uniform Commercial Code, that jurisdiction is the
bank's jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(2) If subdivision (1) does not apply and an agreement between the bank
and its customer governing the deposit account expressly provides that the
agreement is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction
is the bank's jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(3) If neither subdivision (1) nor subdivision (2) applies and an agreement
between the bank and its customer governing the deposit account expressly
provides that the deposit account is maintained at an office in a particular
jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the bank's jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(4) If none of the preceding subdivisions applies, the bank's jurisdiction
is the jurisdiction in which the office identified in an account statement
as the office serving the customer's account is located.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(5) If none of the preceding subdivisions applies, the bank's jurisdiction
is the jurisdiction in which the chief executive office of the bank is located.</p>

<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Source.</span> New; derived from section 8-110(e) and former section 9-103(6).</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Deposit Accounts.</span> Under this section, the law of the "bank's jurisdiction" governs perfection and priority of a security interest in deposit accounts. Subsection (b) contains rules for determining the "bank's jurisdiction". The substance of these rules is substantially similar to that of the rules determining the "security intermediary's jurisdiction" under former section 8-110(e), except that subsection (b)(1) provides more flexibility than the analogous provision in former section 8-110(e)(1). Subsection (b)(1) permits the parties to choose the law of one jurisdiction to govern perfection and priority of security interests and a different governing law for other purposes. The parties' choice is effective, even if the jurisdiction whose law is chosen bears no relationship to the parties or the transaction. Section 8-110(e)(1) has been conformed to subsection (b)(1) of this section, and section 9-305(b)(1), concerning a commodity intermediary's jurisdiction, makes a similar departure from former section 9-103(6)(e)(i).</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Change in Law Governing Perfection.</span> When the bank's jurisdiction changes, the jurisdiction whose law governs perfection under subsection (a) changes, as well. Nevertheless, the change will not result in an immediate loss of perfection. See section 9-316(f) and (g).</span><br><br>
