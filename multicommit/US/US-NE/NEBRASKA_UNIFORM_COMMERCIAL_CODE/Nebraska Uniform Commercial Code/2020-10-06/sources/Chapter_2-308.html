<div style="text-indent: 1em;">If both parties know buyer is to pick up goods at place of storage, that is place for delivery. Goosic Constr. Co. v. City Nat. Bank of Crete, 196 Neb. 86, 241 N.W.2d 521 (1976).</div>
<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</span> Paragraphs (a) and (b) — section 43(1), Uniform Sales Act; paragraph (c) — none.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes:</span> Slight modification in language.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</span></span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">1. Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide for those noncommercial sales and for those occasional commercial sales where no place or means of delivery has been agreed upon by the parties. Where delivery by carrier is "required or authorized by the agreement", the seller's duties as to delivery of the goods are governed not by this section but by section 2-504.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">2. Under paragraph (b) when the identified goods contracted for are known to both parties to be in some location other than the seller's place of business or residence, the parties are presumed to have intended that place to be the place of delivery. This paragraph also applies (unless, as would be normal, the circumstances show that delivery by way of documents is intended) to a bulk of goods in the possession of a bailee. In such a case, however, the seller has the additional obligation to procure the acknowledgement by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">3. Where "customary banking channels" call only for due notification by the banker that the documents are available, leaving the buyer himself or herself to see to the physical receipt of the goods, tender at the buyer's address is not required under paragraph (c). But that paragraph merely eliminates the possibility of a default by the seller if "customary banking channels" have been properly used in giving notice to the buyer. Where the bank has purchased a draft accompanied by or associated with documents or has undertaken its collection on behalf of the seller, part 5 of article 4 spells out its duties and relations to its customer. Where the documents move forward under a letter of credit the Article on Letters of Credit spells out the duties and relations between the bank, the seller, and the buyer. Delivery in relationship to either tangible or electronic documents of title is defined in article 1, section 1-201.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">4. The rules of this section apply only "unless otherwise agreed". The surrounding circumstances, usage of trade, course of dealing, and course of performance, as well as the express language of the parties, may constitute an "otherwise agreement".</div>
