<strong>9-518.
			Claim concerning inaccurate or wrongfully
filed record.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a) A person may file in the filing office an information statement with respect to a record
indexed there under the person's name if the person believes that the record
is inaccurate or was wrongfully filed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(b) An information statement under subsection (a) must:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(1) identify the record to which it relates by the file number assigned
to the initial financing statement to which the record relates;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(2) indicate that it is an information statement;
and</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(3) provide the basis for the person's belief that the record is inaccurate
and indicate the manner in which the person believes the record should be
amended to cure any inaccuracy or provide the basis for the person's belief
that the record was wrongfully filed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(c) A person may file
in the filing office an information statement with respect to a record filed
there if the person is a secured party of record with respect to the financing

the record was not entitled to do so under section 9-509(d).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(d) An information statement
under subsection (c) must:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(1) identify the record to which it relates by the

relates;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(2)
indicate that it is an information statement; and</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(3) provide the basis for the person's

<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Source.</span> New.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Information Statements.</span> Former article 9 did not afford a nonjudicial means for a debtor to indicate that a financing statement or other record was inaccurate or wrongfully filed. Subsection (a) affords the debtor the right to file an information statement. Among other requirements, the information statement must provide the basis for the debtor's belief that the public record should be corrected. See subsection (b). These provisions, which resemble the analogous remedy in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1681i, afford an aggrieved person the opportunity to state its position on the public record. They do not permit an aggrieved person to change the legal effect of the public record. Thus, although a filed information statement becomes part of the "financing statement", as defined in section 9-102, the filing does not affect the effectiveness of the initial financing statement or any other filed record. See subsection (e).</span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Sometimes a person files a termination statement or other record relating to a filed financing statement without being entitled to do so. A secured party of record with respect to the financing statement who believes that such a record has been filed may, but need not, file an information statement indicating that the person that filed the record was not entitled to do so. See subsection (c). An information statement has no legal effect. Its sole purpose is to provide some limited public notice that the efficacy of a filed record is disputed. If the person that filed the record was not entitled to do so, the filed record is ineffective, regardless of whether the secured party of record files an information statement. Likewise, if the person that filed the record was entitled to do so, the filed record is effective, even if the secured party of record files an information statement. See section 9-510(a), 9-518(e). Because an information statement filed under subsection (c) has no legal effect, a secured party of record—even one who is aware of the unauthorized filing of a record—has no duty to file one. Just as searchers bear the burden of determining whether the filing of initial financing statement was authorized, searchers bear the burden of determining whether the filing of every subsequent record was authorized.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Inasmuch as the filing of an information statement has no legal effect, this section does not provide a mechanism by which a secured party can correct an error that it discovers in its own financing statement.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This section does not displace other provisions of this article that impose liability for making unauthorized filings or failing to file or send a termination statement (see section 9-625(e)), nor does it displace any available judicial remedies.</div>
<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Resort to Other Law.</span> This article cannot provide a satisfactory or complete solution to problems caused by misuse of the public records. The problem of "bogus" filings is not limited to the UCC filing system but extends to the real property records, as well. A summary judicial procedure for correcting the public record and criminal penalties for those who misuse the filing and recording systems are likely to be more effective and put less strain on the filing system than provisions authorizing or requiring action by filing and recording offices.</span><br><br>
