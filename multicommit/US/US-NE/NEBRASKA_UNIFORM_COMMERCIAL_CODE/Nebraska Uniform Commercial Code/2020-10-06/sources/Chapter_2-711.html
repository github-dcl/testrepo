<div style="text-indent: 1em;">Where seller fails to deliver, buyer may cancel, recover payments made, and "cover" and have damages for purchase of substitute goods. Farmer's Union Co-op Co. of Mead v. Flamme Brothers, 196 Neb. 699, 245 N.W.2d 464 (1976).</div>
<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</span> No comparable index section; subsection (3) — section 69(5), Uniform Sales Act.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes:</span> The prior uniform statutory provision is generally continued and expanded in subsection (3).</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</span></span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">1. To index in this section the buyer's remedies, subsection (1) covering those remedies permitting the recovery of money damages, and subsection (2) covering those which permit reaching the goods themselves. The remedies listed here are those available to a buyer who has not accepted the goods or who has justifiably revoked his or her acceptance. The remedies available to a buyer with regard to goods finally accepted appear in the section dealing with breach in regard to accepted goods. The buyer's right to proceed as to all goods when the breach is as to only some of the goods is determined by the section on breach in installment contracts and by the section on partial acceptance.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Despite the seller's breach, proper retender of delivery under the section on cure of improper tender or replacement can effectively preclude the buyer's remedies under this section, except for any delay involved.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">2. To make it clear in subsection (3) that the buyer may hold and resell rejected goods if he or she has paid a part of the price or incurred expenses of the type specified. "Paid" as used here includes acceptance of a draft or other time negotiable instrument or the signing of a negotiable note. His or her freedom of resale is coextensive with that of a seller under this article except that the buyer may not keep any profit resulting from the resale and is limited to retaining only the amount of the price paid and the costs involved in the inspection and handling of the goods. The buyer's security interest in the goods is intended to be limited to the items listed in subsection (3), and the buyer is not permitted to retain such funds as he or she might believe adequate for his or her damages. The buyer's right to cover, or to have damages for nondelivery, is not impaired by his or her exercise of his or her right of resale.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">3. It should also be noted that the code requires its remedies to be liberally administered and provides that any right or obligation which it declares is enforceable by action unless a different effect is specifically prescribed (section 1-106).</div>
