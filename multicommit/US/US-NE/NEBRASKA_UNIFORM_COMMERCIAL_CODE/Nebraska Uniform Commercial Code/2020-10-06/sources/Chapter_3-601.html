<div style="text-indent: 1em;">For purposes of subsection (1) of former section 3-601, a setoff is a means of satisfaction of a debt. Harmon Cable Communications v. Scope Cable Television, 237 Neb. 871, 468 N.W.2d 350 (1991).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Subsection (2) of former section 3-601 is a "catchall" provision which does not come into play if a debt is discharged by some means encompassed in subsection (1) of this section. Harmon Cable Communications v. Scope Cable Television, 237 Neb. 871, 468 N.W.2d 350 (1991).</div>
<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Subsection (a) replaces subsections (1) and (2) of former section 3-601. Subsection (b) restates former section 3-602. Notice of discharge is not treated as notice of a defense that prevents holder-in-due-course status. Section 3-302(b). Discharge is effective against a holder in due course only if the holder had notice of the discharge when holder-in-due-course status was acquired. For example, if an instrument bearing a canceled indorsement is taken by a holder, the holder has notice that the indorser has been discharged. Thus, the discharge is effective against the holder even if the holder is a holder in due course.</div>
