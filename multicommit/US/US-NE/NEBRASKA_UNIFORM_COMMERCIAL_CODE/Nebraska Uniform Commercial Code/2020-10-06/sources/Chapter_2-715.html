<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prior Uniform Statutory Provisions:</span> Subsection (2)(b) — sections 69(7) and 70, Uniform Sales Act.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes:</span> Rewritten.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purposes of Changes and New Matter:</span></span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">1. Subsection (1) is intended to provide reimbursement for the buyer who incurs reasonable expenses in connection with the handling of rightfully rejected goods or goods whose acceptance may be justifiably revoked, or in connection with effecting cover where the breach of the contract lies in nonconformity or nondelivery of the goods. The incidental damages listed are not intended to be exhaustive but are merely illustrative of the typical kinds of incidental damage.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">2. Subsection (2) operates to allow the buyer, in an appropriate case, any consequential damages which are the result of the seller's breach. The "tacit agreement" test for the recovery of consequential damages is rejected. Although the older rule at common law which made the seller liable for all consequential damages of which he or she had "reason to know" in advance is followed, the liberality of that rule is modified by refusing to permit recovery unless the buyer could not reasonably have prevented the loss by cover or otherwise. Subparagraph (2) carries forward the provisions of the prior uniform statutory provision as to consequential damages resulting from breach of warranty, but modifies the rule by requiring first that the buyer attempt to minimize his or her damages in good faith, either by cover or otherwise.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">3. In the absence of excuse under the section on merchant's excuse by failure of presupposed conditions, the seller is liable for consequential damages in all cases where he or she had reason to know of the buyer's general or particular requirements at the time of contracting. It is not necessary that there be a conscious acceptance of an insurer's liability on the seller's part, nor is his or her obligation for consequential damages limited to cases in which he or she fails to use due effort in good faith.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Particular needs of the buyer must generally be made known to the seller while general needs must rarely be made known to charge the seller with knowledge.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Any seller who does not wish to take the risk of consequential damages has available the section on contractual limitation of remedy.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">4. The burden of proving the extent of loss incurred by way of consequential damage is on the buyer, but the section on liberal administration of remedies rejects any doctrine of certainty which requires almost mathematical precision in the proof of loss. Loss may be determined in any manner which is reasonable under the circumstances.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">5. Subsection (2)(b) states the usual rule as to breach of warranty, allowing recovery for injuries "proximately" resulting from the breach. Where the injury involved follows the use of goods without discovery of the defect causing the damage, the question of "proximate" cause turns on whether it was reasonable for the buyer to use the goods without such inspection as would have revealed the defects. If it was not reasonable for him or her to do so, or if he or she did in fact discover the defect prior to his or her use, the injury would not proximately result from the breach of warranty.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">6. In the case of sale of wares to one in the business of reselling them, resale is one of the requirements of which the seller has reason to know within the meaning of subsection (2)(a).</div>
