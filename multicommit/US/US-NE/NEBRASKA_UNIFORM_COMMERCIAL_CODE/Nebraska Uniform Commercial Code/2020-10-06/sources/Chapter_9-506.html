<strong>9-506.
			Effect of errors or omissions.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements
of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless
the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to
provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 9-503(a) is seriously
misleading.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(c) If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's
correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would
disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name
of the debtor in accordance with section 9-503(a), the name provided does
not make the financing statement seriously misleading.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(d) For purposes of section 9-508(b), the "debtor's correct name" in
subsection (c) means
the correct name of the new debtor.</p>

<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Source.</span> Former section 9-402(8).</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Errors and omissions.</span> Like former section 9-402(8), subsection (a) is in line with the policy of this article to simplify formal requisites and filing requirements. It is designed to discourage the fanatical and impossibly refined reading of statutory requirements in which courts occasionally have indulged themselves. Subsection (a) provides the standard applicable to indications of collateral. Subsections (b) and (c), which are new, concern the effectiveness of financing statements in which the debtor's name is incorrect. Subsection (b) contains the general rule: a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the debtor's name in accordance with section 9-503(a) is seriously misleading as a matter of law. Subsection (c) provides an exception: If the financing statement nevertheless would be discovered in a search under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, then as a matter of law the incorrect name does not make the financing statement seriously misleading. A financing statement that is seriously misleading under this section is ineffective even if it is disclosed by (i) using a search logic other than that of the filing office to search the official records, or (ii) using the filing office's standard search logic to search a data base other than that of the filing office. For purposes of subsection (c), any name that satisfies section 9-503(a) at the time of the search is a "correct name."</span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This section and section 9-503 balance the interests of filers and searchers. Searchers are not expected to ascertain nicknames, trade names, and the like by which the debtor may be known and then search under each of them. Rather, it is the secured party's responsibility to provide the name of the debtor sufficiently in a filed financing statement. Subsection (c) sets forth the only situation in which a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor is not seriously misleading. As stated in subsection (b), if the name of the debtor provided on a financing statement is insufficient and subsection (c) is not satisfied, the financing statement is seriously misleading. Such a financing statement is ineffective even if the debtor is known in some contexts by the name provided on the financing statement and even if searchers know or have reason to know that the name provided on the financing statement refers to the debtor. Any suggestion to the contrary in a judicial opinion is incorrect.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">To satisfy the requirements of section 9-503(a)(2), a financing statement must indicate that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative. To satisfy the requirements of section 9-503(a)(3), a financing statement must indicate that the collateral is held in a trust and provide additional information that distinguishes the trust from certain other trusts. The indications and additional information are not part of the debtor's name. Nevertheless, a financing statement that fails to provide an indication or the additional information when required does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor under sections 9-502(a) and 9-503(a), does not "substantially satisfy the requirements" of part 5 within the meaning of this section and so is ineffective.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">In addition to requiring the debtor's name and an indication of the collateral, section 9-502(a) requires a financing statement to provide the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party. Inasmuch as searches are not conducted under the secured party's name, and no filing is needed to continue the perfected status of security interest after it is assigned, an error in the name of the secured party or its representative will not be seriously misleading. However, in an appropriate case, an error of this kind may give rise to an estoppel in favor of a particular holder of a conflicting claim to the collateral. See section 1-103.</div>
<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. New Debtors.</span> Subsection (d) provides that, in determining the extent to which a financing statement naming an original debtor is effective against a new debtor, the sufficiency of the financing statement should be tested against the name of the new debtor.</span><br><br>
