<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Rejection of breach of warranty instruction as regards manufacturer was not error where alleged failure to warn of danger was not proximate cause of injury.

<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</span> Section 69(6) and (7), Uniform Sales Act.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes:</span> Rewritten.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purposes of Changes:</span></span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">1. This section deals with the remedies available to the buyer after the goods have been accepted and the time for revocation of acceptance has gone by. In general this section adopts the rule of the prior uniform statutory provision for measuring damages where there has been a breach of warranty as to goods accepted, but goes further to lay down an explicit provision as to the time and place for determining the loss.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">The section on deduction of damages from price provides an additional remedy for a buyer who still owes part of the purchase price, and frequently the two remedies will be available concurrently. The buyer's failure to notify of his or her claim under the section on effects of acceptance, however, operates to bar his or her remedies under either that section or the present section.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">2. The "nonconformity" referred to in subsection (1) includes not only breaches of warranties but also any failure of the seller to perform according to his or her obligations under the contract. In the case of such nonconformity, the buyer is permitted to recover for his or her loss "in any manner which is reasonable".</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">3. Subsection (2) describes the usual, standard, and reasonable method of ascertaining damages in the case of breach of warranty but it is not intended as an exclusive measure. It departs from the measure of damages for nondelivery in utilizing the place of acceptance rather than the place of tender. In some cases the two may coincide, as where the buyer signifies his or her acceptance upon the tender. If, however, the nonconformity is such as would justify revocation of acceptance, the time and place of acceptance under this section is determined as of the buyer's decision not to revoke.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">4. The incidental and consequential damages referred to in subsection (3), which will usually accompany an action brought under this section, are discussed in detail in the comment on the next section.</div>
