<strong>3-108.
			Payable on demand or at definite time.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a) A promise or order is "payable on demand" if it (i) states that it is payable on demand or at sight, or otherwise indicates that it is payable at the will of the holder, or (ii) does not state any time of payment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(b) A promise or order is "payable at a definite time" if it is payable on elapse of a definite period of time after sight or acceptance or at a fixed date or dates or at a time or times readily ascertainable at the time the promise or order is issued, subject to rights of (i) prepayment, (ii) acceleration, (iii) extension at the option of the holder, or (iv) extension to a further definite time at the option of the maker or acceptor or automatically upon or after a specified act or event.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(c) If an instrument, payable at a fixed date, is also payable upon demand made before the fixed date, the instrument is payable on demand until the fixed date and, if demand for payment is not made before that date, becomes payable at a definite time on the fixed date.</p>

<div style="text-indent: 1em;">Under former section 3-108, company check held to be a demand instrument payable on sight or presentment to a collecting bank. Berman v. United States Nat. Bank, 197 Neb. 268, 249 N.W.2d 187 (1976).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Under former section 3-108, note which contained no due date held to be a demand note. Erickson v. Newell, 183 Neb. 641, 163 N.W.2d 286 (1968).</div>
<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This section is a restatement of former section 3-108 and section 3-109. Subsection (b) broadens former section 3-109 somewhat by providing that a definite time includes a time readily ascertainable at the time the promise or order is issued. Subsection (b)(iii) and (iv) restates former section 3-109(1)(d). It adopts the generally accepted rule that a clause providing for extension at the option of the holder, even without a time limit, does not affect negotiability since the holder is given only a right which the holder would have without the clause. If the extension is to be at the option of the maker or acceptor or is to be automatic, a definite time limit must be stated or the time of payment remains uncertain and the order or promise is not a negotiable instrument. If a definite time limit is stated, the effect upon certainty of time of payment is the same as if the instrument were made payable at the ultimate date with a term providing for acceleration.</div>
