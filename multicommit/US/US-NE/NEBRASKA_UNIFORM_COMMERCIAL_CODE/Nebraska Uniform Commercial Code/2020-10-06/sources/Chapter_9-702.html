Pre-July 1, 2001, Transactions.</span> Subsection (a) contains the general rule that this article applies to transactions, security interests, and other liens within its scope (see section 9-109), even if the transaction or lien was entered into or created before July 1, 2001. Thus, secured transactions entered into under former article 9 must be terminated, completed, consummated, and enforced under this article. Subsection (b) is an exception to the general rule. It applies to valid, pre-July 1, 2001, transactions and liens that were not governed by former article 9 but would be governed by this article if they had been entered into or created on or after July 1, 2001. Under subsection (b), these valid transactions, such as the creation of agricultural liens and security interests in commercial tort claims, retain their validity under this article and may be terminated, completed, consummated, and enforced under this article. However, these transactions also may be terminated, completed, consummated, and enforced by the law that otherwise would apply had this article not taken effect.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Judicial Proceedings Commenced Before July 1, 2001.</span> As is usual in transition provisions, subsection (c) provides that this article does not affect litigation pending on the July 1, 2001, date.</span><br><br>
