Claims covered by the section include not only claims to ownership but also any other claim of a property or possessory right. It includes the claim to a lien or the claim of a person in rightful possession of an instrument who was wrongfully deprived of possession. Also included is a claim based on section 3-202(b) for rescission of a negotiation of the instrument by the claimant. Claims to an instrument under section 3-306 are different from claims in recoupment referred to in section 3-305(a)(3).</div>
