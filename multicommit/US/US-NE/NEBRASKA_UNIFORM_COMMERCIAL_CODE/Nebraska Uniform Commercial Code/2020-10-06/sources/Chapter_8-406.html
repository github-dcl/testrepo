<strong>8-406.
			Obligation to notify issuer of lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken security certificate.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">If a security certificate has been lost, apparently destroyed, or wrongfully taken, and the owner fails to notify the issuer of that fact within a reasonable time after the owner has notice of it and the issuer registers a transfer of the security before receiving notification, the owner may not assert against the issuer a claim for registering the transfer under section 8-404 or a claim to a new security certificate under section 8-405.</p>

If the lost certificate was indorsed by the owner, then the registration of the transfer was not wrongful under section 8-404, unless the owner made an effective demand that the issuer not register transfer under section 8-403.</div>
