<strong>9-522.
			Maintenance and destruction of records.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a) The filing office shall maintain a record of the information provided in a filed financing statement for at least one year after the effectiveness of the financing statement has lapsed under section 9-515 with respect to all secured parties of record. The record must be retrievable by using the name of the debtor and by using the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(b) Except to the extent that a statute governing disposition of public records provides otherwise, the filing office immediately may destroy any written record evidencing a financing statement. However, if the filing office destroys a written record, it shall maintain another record of the financing statement which complies with subsection (a).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a record of a financing statement or amendment statement for which the place of filing was changed by Laws 1998, LB 1321, and which financing statement or amendment statement could have been continued or was continued by filing a new continuation statement pursuant to Laws 1998, LB 1321, section 110, does not have to be retained by the original filing office and may be disposed of or destroyed.</p>

<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Source.</span> Former section 9-403(3), revised substantially.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Maintenance of Records.</span> Section 9-523 requires the filing office to provide information concerning certain lapsed financing statements. Accordingly, subsection (a) requires the filing office to maintain a record of the information in a financing statement for at least one year after lapse. During that time, the filing office may not delete any information with respect to a filed financing statement; it may only add information. This approach relieves the filing office from any duty to determine whether to substitute or delete information upon receipt of an amendment. It also assures searchers that they will receive all information with respect to financing statements filed against a debtor and thereby be able themselves to determine the state of the public record.</span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">The filing office may maintain this information in any medium. Subsection (b) permits the filing office immediately to destroy written records evidencing a financing statement, provided that the filing office maintains another record of the information contained in the financing statement as required by subsection (a).</div>
