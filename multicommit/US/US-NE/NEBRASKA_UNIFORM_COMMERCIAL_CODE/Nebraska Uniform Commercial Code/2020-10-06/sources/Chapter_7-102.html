<span style="padding-right: 0.05in;"><strong>Annotations</strong></span><ul>
<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</span> Former section 7-102.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes:</span> New definitions of "carrier", "good faith", "record", "sign", and "shipper". Other definitions revised to accommodate electronic mediums.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purposes:</span></span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">1. "Bailee" is used in this article as a blanket term to designate carriers, warehousemen, and others who normally issue documents of title on the basis of goods which they have received. The definition does not, however, require actual possession of the goods. If a bailee acknowledges possession when it does not have possession, the bailee is bound by sections of this article which declare the "bailee's" obligations. (See definition of "issuer" in this section and sections 7-203 and 7-301 on liability in case of nonreceipt.)  A "carrier" is one type of bailee and is defined as a person that issues a bill of lading. A "shipper" is a person who enters into the contract of transportation with the carrier. The definitions of "bailee", "consignee", "consignor", "goods", and "issuer", are unchanged in substance from prior law. "Document of title" is defined in article 1, and may be in either tangible or electronic form.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">2. The definition of warehouse receipt contained in the general definitions section of this code (section 1-201) does not require that the issuing warehouse be "lawfully engaged" in business or for profit. The warehouse's compliance with applicable state regulations such as the filing of a bond has no bearing on the substantive issues dealt with in this article. Certainly the
issuer's violations of law should not diminish its responsibility on documents the issuer has put in commercial circulation. But it
is still essential that the business be storing goods "for hire" (section 1-201 and this section). A person does not become a
warehouse by storing its own goods.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">3. When a delivery order has been accepted by the bailee it is for practical purposes indistinguishable from a warehouse receipt. Prior to such acceptance there is no basis for imposing obligations on the bailee other than the ordinary obligation of
contract which the bailee may have assumed to the depositor of the goods. Delivery orders may be either electronic or tangible
documents of title. See definition of "document of title" in section 1-201.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">4. The obligation of good faith imposed by this article and by article 1, section 1-304 includes the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">5. The definitions of "record" and "sign" are included to facilitate electronic mediums. See comment 9 to section 9-102
discussing "record" and the comment to amended section 2-103 discussing "sign".</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">6. "Person entitled under the document" is moved from former section 7-403.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">7. These definitions apply in this article unless the context otherwise requires. The "context" is intended to refer to the
context in which the defined term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code. The definition applies whenever the defined term
is used unless the context in which the defined term is used in the statute indicates that the term was not used in its defined
sense. See comment to section 1-201.</div>
