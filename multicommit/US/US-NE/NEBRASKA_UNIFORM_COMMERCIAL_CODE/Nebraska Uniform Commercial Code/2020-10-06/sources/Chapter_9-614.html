<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(D) a telephone number or mailing address from which additional information concerning the disposition and the obligation secured is available.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(2) A particular phrasing of the notification is not required.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(3) In no event shall it be necessary for the notification of disposition to refer to any guarantee agreement, to identify or designate the capacity in which a debtor or secondary obligor is being sent such notification, or to identify or designate the capacity in which the debtor or secondary obligor may be liable for any deficiency existing after sale or disposition of collateral.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(4) The following form of notification, when completed, provides sufficient information:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">......(Name and address of secured party)......</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">......(Date)......</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">NOTICE OF OUR PLAN TO SELL PROPERTY</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">......(Name and address of any obligor who is also a debtor)......</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Subject: ......(Identification of Transaction)......</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">We have your ......(describe collateral)......, because you broke promises in our agreement.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(For a public disposition:)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">We will sell ......(describe collateral)...... at public sale.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Time: ...............................................</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Place: ..............................................</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(6) A notification in the form of subdivision (4) is sufficient, even if it includes errors in information not required by subdivision (1), unless the error is misleading with respect to rights arising under this article.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(7) If a notification under this section is not in the form of subdivision (4), law other than this article determines the effect of including information not required by subdivision (1).</p>

Source.</span> New.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Notification in Consumer-Goods Transactions.</span> Paragraph (1) sets forth the information required for a reasonable notification in a consumer-goods transaction. A notification that lacks any of the information set forth in paragraph (1) is insufficient as a matter of law. Compare section 9-613(2), under which the trier of fact may find a notification to be sufficient even if it lacks some information listed in paragraph (1) of that section.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Safe-Harbor Form of Notification; Errors in Information.</span> Although paragraph (2) provides that a particular phrasing of a notification is not required, paragraph (3) specifies a safe-harbor form that, when properly completed, satisfies paragraph (1). Paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) contain special rules applicable to erroneous and additional information. Under paragraph (4), a notification in the safe-harbor form specified in paragraph (3) is not rendered insufficient if it contains additional information at the end of the form. Paragraph (5) provides that nonmisleading errors in information contained in a notification are permitted if the safe-harbor form is used and if the errors are in information not required by paragraph (1). Finally, if a notification is in a form other than the paragraph (3) safe-harbor form, other law determines the effect of including in the notification information other than that required by paragraph (1).</span><br><br>
