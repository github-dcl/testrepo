			Contents and form of notification before disposition of collateral: general.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Except in a consumer-goods transaction, the following rules apply:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(1) The contents of a notification of disposition are sufficient if the notification:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(A) describes the debtor and the secured party;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(B) describes the collateral that is the subject of the intended disposition;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(C) states the method of intended disposition;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(D) states that the debtor is entitled to an accounting of the unpaid indebtedness and states the charge, if any, for an accounting; and</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(E) states the time and place of a public disposition or the time after which any other disposition is to be made.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(2) Whether the contents of a notification that lacks any of the information specified in subdivision (1) are nevertheless sufficient is a question of fact.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(3) The contents of a notification providing substantially the information specified in subdivision (1) are sufficient, even if the notification includes:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(A) information not specified by that subdivision; or</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(B) minor errors that are not seriously misleading.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(4) A particular phrasing of the notification is not required.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(5) In no event shall it be necessary for the notification of disposition to refer to any guarantee agreement, to identify or designate the capacity in which a debtor or secondary obligor is being sent such notification, or to identify or designate the capacity in which the debtor or secondary obligor may be liable for any deficiency existing after sale or disposition of collateral.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(6) The following form of notification and the form appearing in section 9-614(4), when completed, each provides sufficient information:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">NOTIFICATION OF DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL</p>

Source.</span> New.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Contents of Notification.</span> To comply with the "reasonable authenticated notification" requirement of section 9-611(b), the contents of a notification must be reasonable. Except in a consumer-goods transaction, the contents of a notification that includes the information set forth in paragraph (1) are sufficient as a matter of law, unless the parties agree otherwise. (The reference to "time" of disposition means here, as it did in former section 9-504(3), not only the hour of the day but also the date.) Although a secured party may choose to include additional information concerning the transaction or the debtor's rights and obligations, no additional information is required unless the parties agree otherwise. A notification that lacks some of the information set forth in paragraph (1) nevertheless may be sufficient if found to be reasonable by the trier of fact, under paragraph (2). A properly completed sample form of notification in paragraph (5) or in section 9-614(3) is an example of a notification that would contain the information set forth in paragraph (1). Under paragraph (4), however, no particular phrasing of the notification is required.</span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This section applies to a notification of a public disposition conducted electronically. A notification of an electronic disposition satisfies paragraph (1)(E) if it states the time when the disposition is scheduled to begin and states the electronic location. For example, under the technology current in 2010, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or other Internet address where the site of the public disposition can be accessed sufficies as an electronic location.</div>
