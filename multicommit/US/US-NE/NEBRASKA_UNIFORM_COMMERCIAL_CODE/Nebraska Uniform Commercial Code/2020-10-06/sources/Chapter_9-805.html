<strong>9-805.
			Effectiveness of action taken before
July 1, 2013.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a)
The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2013, is effective to perfect
a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable
requirements for perfection under this article as it existed on July 1, 2013.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(b) This article does
not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before July
1, 2013, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection
under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this
article as it existed before July 1, 2013. However, except as otherwise provided
in subsections (c) and (d) and section 9-806, the financing statement ceases
to be effective:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(1)
if the financing statement is filed in this state, at the time the financing
statement would have ceased to be effective had Laws 2011, LB90, not become
law; or</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(2)
if the financing statement is filed in another jurisdiction, at the earlier
of:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(A)
the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the
law of that jurisdiction; or</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(B) June 30, 2018.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(c) The filing of a continuation statement on or after
July 1, 2013, does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement
filed before July 1, 2013. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation
statement on or after July 1, 2013, and in accordance with the law of the
jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this article as it existed
on July 1, 2013, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same
office in that jurisdiction before July 1, 2013, continues for the period
provided by the law of that jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(d) Subsection (b)(2)(B) applies to a financing statement
that, before July 1, 2013, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies
the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction
governing perfection as provided in this article as it existed before July
1, 2013, only to the extent that this article as it existed on July 1, 2013,
provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which
the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest
in collateral covered by the financing statement.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(e) A financing statement that includes
a financing statement filed before July 1, 2013, and a continuation statement
filed on or after July 1, 2013, is effective only to the extent that it satisfies
the requirements of part 5 as it existed on July 1, 2013, for an initial financing
statement. A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a decedent's
estate indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative
within the meaning of section 9-503(a)(2) as it existed on July 1, 2013. A
financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee
acting with respect to property held in trust indicates that the collateral
is held in a trust within the meaning of section 9-503(a)(3) as it existed
on July 1, 2013.</p>
