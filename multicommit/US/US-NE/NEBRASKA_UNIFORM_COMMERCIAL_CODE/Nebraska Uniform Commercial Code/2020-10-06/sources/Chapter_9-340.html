			Effectiveness of right of recoupment or set-off against deposit account.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a bank with which a deposit account is maintained may exercise any right of recoupment or set-off against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the application of this article to a security interest in a deposit account does not affect a right of recoupment or set-off of the secured party as to a deposit account maintained with the secured party.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(c) The exercise by a bank of a set-off against a deposit account is ineffective against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account which is perfected by control under section 9-104(a)(3), if the set-off is based on a claim against the debtor.</p>

<span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMMENT</span></span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Source.</span> New; subsection (b) is based on a nonuniform Illinois amendment.</span><br><br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Set-off vs. Security Interest.</span> This section resolves the conflict between a security interest in a deposit account and the bank's rights of recoupment and set-off.</span><br><br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Subsection (a) states the general rule and provides that the bank may effectively exercise rights of recoupment and set-off against the secured party. Subsection (c) contains an exception: If the secured party has control under section 9-104(a)(3) (i.e., if it has become the bank's customer), then any set-off exercised by the bank against a debt owed by the debtor (as opposed to a debt owed to the bank by the secured party) is ineffective. The bank may, however, exercise its recoupment rights effectively. This result is consistent with the priority rule in section 9-327(4), under which the security interest of a bank in a deposit account is subordinate to that of a secured party who has control under section 9-104(a)(3).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This section deals with rights of set-off and recoupment that a bank may have under other law. It does not create a right of set-off or recoupment, nor is it intended to override any limitations or restrictions that other law imposes on the exercise of those rights.</div>
<br><span style="margin-left: -2em;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Preservation of Set-Off Right.</span> Subsection (b) makes clear that a bank may hold both a right of set-off against, and an article 9 security interest in, the same deposit account. By holding a security interest in a deposit account, a bank does not impair any right of set-off it would otherwise enjoy. This subsection does not pertain to accounts evidenced by an instrument (e.g., certain certificates of deposit), which are excluded from the definition of "deposit accounts".</span><br><br>
