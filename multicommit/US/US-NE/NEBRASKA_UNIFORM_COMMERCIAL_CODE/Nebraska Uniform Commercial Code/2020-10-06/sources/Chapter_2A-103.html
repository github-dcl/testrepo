			Definitions and index of definitions.</strong><br><p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(1) In this article unless the context otherwise requires:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(a) "Buyer in ordinary course of business" means a person who in good
faith and without knowledge that the sale to him or her is in violation of
the ownership rights or security interest or leasehold interest of a third
party in the goods, buys in ordinary course from a person in the business
of selling goods of that kind but does not include a pawnbroker. "Buying"
may be for cash or by exchange of other property or on secured or unsecured
credit and includes acquiring goods or documents of title under a preexisting
contract for sale but does not include a transfer in bulk or as security for
or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.</p>

contract for default by the other party.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(c) "Commercial unit" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage
is a single whole for purposes of lease and division of which materially impairs
its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a
single article, as a machine, or a set of articles, as a suite of furniture

the goods or the right to possession and use of the goods is a condition to
effectiveness of the lease contract;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(C) the lessee, before signing the lease contract, receives an accurate
and complete statement designating the promises and warranties, and any disclaimers
of warranties, limitations or modifications of remedies, or liquidated damages,
including those of a third party, such as the manufacturer of the goods, provided
to the lessor by the person supplying the goods in connection with or as part
of the contract by which the lessor acquired the goods or the right to possession

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(D) if the lease is not a consumer lease, the lessor, before the lessee
signs the lease contract, informs the lessee in writing (a) of the identity
of the person supplying the goods to the lessor, unless the lessee has selected
that person and directed the lessor to acquire the goods or the right to possession
and use of the goods from that person, (b) that the lessee is entitled under
this article to the promises and warranties, including those of any third
party, provided to the lessor by the person supplying the goods in connection
with or as part of the contract by which the lessor acquired the goods or
the right to possession and use of the goods, and (c) that the lessee may

any disclaimers and limitations of them or of remedies.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(h) "Goods" means all things that are movable at the time of identification
to the lease contract, or are fixtures (section 2A-309), but the term does

<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(l) "Lease contract" means the total legal obligation that results from
the lease agreement as affected by this article and any other applicable rules
of law. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term includes
a sublease contract.</p>

party in the goods leases in ordinary course from a person in the business
of selling or leasing goods of that kind but does not include a pawnbroker.
"Leasing" may be for cash or by exchange of other property or on secured or

goods after expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease contract.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(r) "Lien" means a charge against or interest in goods to secure payment

to goods of the kind subject to the lease.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(u) "Present value" means the amount as of a date certain of one or
more sums payable in the future, discounted to the date certain. The discount
is determined by the interest rate specified by the parties if the rate was

takes into account the facts and circumstances of each case at the time the
transaction was entered into.</p>

pledge, gift, or any other voluntary transaction creating an interest in goods.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">(w) "Sublease" means a lease of goods the right to possession and use
of which was acquired by the lessor as a lessee under an existing lease.</p>

2A-221, 2A-309, 2A-406, 2A-407, 2A-504(3)(b), and 2A-516(3)(b).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">For a transaction to qualify as a consumer lease it must first qualify
as a lease. Section 2A-103(1)(j). Note that this article regulates the transactional
elements of a lease, including a consumer lease; consumer protection statutes,
present and future, and existing consumer protection decisions are unaffected
by this article. Section 2A-104(1)(c) and (2). Of course, article 2A as state
law also is subject to federal consumer protection law.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This definition is modeled after the definition of consumer lease in
the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1667 (1982), and in the Unif.
Consumer Credit Code section 1.301(14), 7A U.L.A. 43 (1974). However, this
definition of consumer lease differs from its models in several respects:
The lessor can be a person regularly engaged either in the business of leasing
or of selling goods, the lease need not be for a term exceeding four months,
a lease primarily for an agricultural purpose is not covered, and whether
there should be a limitation by dollar amount and its amount is left up to
the individual states.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This definition focuses on the parties as well as the transaction. If
a lease is within this definition, the lessor must be regularly engaged in
the business of leasing or selling, and the lessee must be an individual not
an organization; note that a lease to two or more individuals having a common
interest through marriage or the like is not excluded as a lease to an organization
under section 1-201(28). The lessee must take the interest primarily for a
personal, family, or household purpose. If required by the enacting state,
total payments under the lease contract, excluding payments for options to
renew or buy, cannot exceed the figure designated.</div>

2A-219(1), 2A-220(1)(a), 2A-221, 2A-405(c), 2A-407, 2A-516(2), and 2A-517(1)(a)
and (2).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">For a transaction to qualify as a finance lease it must first qualify
as a lease. Section 2A-103(1)(j). Unless the lessor is comfortable that the
transaction will qualify as a finance lease, the lease agreement should include
provisions giving the lessor the benefits created by the subset of rules applicable
to the transaction that qualifies as a finance lease under this article.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">A finance lease is the product of a three-party transaction. The supplier
manufactures or supplies the goods pursuant to the lessee's specification,
perhaps even pursuant to a purchase order, sales agreement, or lease agreement
between the supplier and the lessee. After the prospective finance lease is
negotiated, a purchase order, sales agreement, or lease agreement is entered
into by the lessor (as buyer or prime lessee) or an existing order, agreement,
or lease is assigned by the lessee to the lessor, and the lessor and the lessee
then enter into a lease or sublease of the goods. Due to the limited function
usually performed by the lessor, the lessee looks almost entirely to the supplier
for representations, covenants, and warranties. If a manufacturer's warranty
carries through, the lessee may also look to that. Yet, this definition does
not restrict the lessor's function solely to the supply of funds; if the lessor
undertakes or performs other functions, express warranties, covenants, and
the common law will protect the lessee.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This definition focuses on the transaction, not the status of the parties;
to avoid confusion it is important to note that in other contexts, e.g., tax
and accounting, the term finance lease has been used to connote different
types of lease transactions, including leases that are disguised secured transactions.
M. Rice, Equipment Financing, 62-71 (1981). A lessor who is a merchant with
respect to goods of the kind subject to the lease may be a lessor under a
finance lease. Many leases that are leases back to the seller of goods (section
2A-308(3)) will be finance leases. This conclusion is easily demonstrated
by a hypothetical. Assume that B has bought goods from C pursuant to a sales
contract. After delivery to and acceptance of the goods by B, B negotiates
to sell the goods to A and simultaneously to lease the goods back from A,
on terms and conditions that, we assume, will qualify the transaction as a
lease. Section 2A-103(1)(j). In documenting the sale and lease back, B assigns
the original sales contract between B, as buyer, and C, as seller, to A. A
review of these facts leads to the conclusion that the lease from A to B qualifies
as a finance lease, as all three conditions of the definition are satisfied.
Subparagraph (i) is satisfied as A, the lessor, had nothing to do with the
selection, manufacture, or supply of the equipment. Subparagraph (ii) is satisfied
as A, the lessor, bought the equipment at the same time that A leased the
equipment to B, which certainly is in connection with the lease. Finally,
subparagraph (iii)(A) is satisfied as A entered into the sales contract with
B at the same time that A leased the equipment back to B. B, the lessee, will
have received a copy of the sales contract in a timely fashion.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Subsection (i) requires the lessor to remain outside the selection,
manufacture, and supply of the goods; that is the rationale for releasing
the lessor from most of its traditional liability. The lessor is not prohibited
from possession, maintenance, or operation of the goods, as policy does not
require such prohibition. To insure the lessee's reliance on the supplier,
and not on the lessor, subsection (ii) requires that the goods (where the
lessor is the buyer of the goods) or that the right to possession and use
of the goods (where the lessor is the prime lessee and the sublessor of the
goods) be acquired in connection with the lease (or sublease) to qualify as
a finance lease. The scope of the phrase "in connection with" is to be developed
by the courts, case by case. Finally, as the lessee generally relies almost
entirely upon the supplier for representations and covenants and upon the
supplier or a manufacturer, or both, for warranties with respect to the goods,
subsection (iii) requires that one of the following occur: (A) The lessee
receive a copy of the supply contract before signing the lease contract; (B)
the lessee's approval of the supply contract is a condition to the effectiveness
of the lease contract; (C) the lessee receive a statement describing the promises
and warranties and any limitations relevant to the lessee before signing the
lease contract; or (D) before signing the lease contract and except in a consumer
lease, the lessee receive a writing identifying the supplier (unless the supplier
was selected and required by the lessee) and the rights of the lessee under
section 2A-209, and advising the lessee a statement of promises and warranties
is available from the supplier. Thus, even where oral supply orders or computer-placed
supply orders are compelled by custom and usage the transaction may still
qualify as a finance lease if the lessee approves the supply contract before
the lease contract is effective and such approval was a condition to the effectiveness
of the lease contract. Moreover, where the lessor does not want the lessee
to see the entire supply contract, including price information, the lessee
may be provided with a separate statement of the terms of the supply contract
relevant to the lessee; promises between the supplier and the lessor that
do not affect the lessee need not be included. The statement can be a restatement
of those terms or a copy of portions of the supply contract with the relevant
terms clearly designated. Any implied warranties need not be designated, but
a disclaimer or modification of remedy must be designated. A copy of any manufacturer's
warranty is sufficient if that is the warranty provided. However, a copy of
any Regulation M disclosure given pursuant to 12 C.F.R. section 213.4(g) concerning
warranties in itself is not sufficient since those disclosures need only briefly
identify express warranties and need not include any disclaimer of warranty.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">If a transaction does not qualify as a finance lease, the parties may
achieve the same result by agreement; no negative implications are to be drawn
if the transaction does not qualify. Further, absent the application of special
rules (fraud, duress, and the like), a lease that qualifies as a finance lease
and is assigned by the lessor or the lessee to a third party does not lose
its status as a finance lease under this article. Finally, this article creates
no special rule where the lessor is an affiliate of the supplier; whether
the transaction qualifies as a finance lease will be determined by the facts
of each case.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(h) "Goods". Section 9-102(a)(44). See section 2A-103(3) for reference
to the definition of "account", "chattel paper", "document", "general intangible",
and "instrument". See section 2A-217 for determination of the time and manner
of identification.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(i) "Installment lease contract". Section 2-612(1).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(j) "Lease". New. There are several reasons to codify the law with respect
to leases of goods. An analysis of the case law as it applies to leases of
goods suggests at least several significant issues to be resolved by codification.
First and foremost is the definition of a lease. It is necessary to define
lease to determine whether a transaction creates a lease or a security interest
disguised as a lease. If the transaction creates a security interest disguised
as a lease, the transaction will be governed by the Article on Secured Transactions
(Article 9) and the lessor will be required to file a financing statement
or take other action to perfect its interest in the goods against third parties.
There is no such requirement with respect to leases under the common law and,
except with respect to leases of fixtures (section 2A-309), this article imposes
no such requirement. Yet the distinction between a lease and a security interest
disguised as a lease is not clear from the case law at the time of the promulgation
of this article. DeKoven, Leases of Equipment: Puritan Leasing Company v.
August, A Dangerous Decision, 12 U.S.F. L. Rev. 257 (1978).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">At common law a lease of personal property is a bailment for hire. While
there are several definitions of bailment for hire, all require a thing to
be let and a price for the letting. Thus, in modern terms and as provided
in this definition, a lease is created when the lessee agrees to furnish consideration
for the right to the possession and use of goods over a specified period of
time. Mooney, Personal Property Leasing: A Challenge, 36 Bus. Law. 1605, 1607
(1981). Further, a lease is neither a sale (section 2-106(1)) nor a retention
or creation of a security interest (sections 1-201(b)(35) and 1-203)). Due
to extensive litigation to distinguish true leases from security interests,
an amendment to former section 1-201(37) (now codified as section 1-203) was
promulgated with this article to create a sharper distinction.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">This section as well as section 1-203 must be examined to determine
whether the transaction in question creates a lease or a security interest.
The following hypotheticals indicate the perimeters of the issue. Assume that
A has purchased a number of copying machines, new, for $1,000 each; the machines
have an estimated useful economic life of three years. A advertises that the
machines are available to rent for a minimum of one month and that the monthly
rental is $100.00. A intends to enter into leases where A provides all maintenance,
without charge to the lessee. Further, the lessee will rent the machine, month
to month, with no obligation to renew. At the end of the lease term the lessee
will be obligated to return the machine to A's place of business. This transaction
qualifies as a lease under the first half of the definition, for the transaction
includes a transfer by A to a prospective lessee of possession and use of
the machine for a stated term, month to month. The machines are goods (section
2A-103(1)(h)). The lessee is obligated to pay consideration in return, $100.00
for each month of the term.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">However, the second half of the definition provides that a sale or a
security interest is not a lease. Since there is no passing of title, there
is no sale. Sections 2-106(1) and 2A-103(3). Under pre-code security law this
transaction would have created a bailment for hire or a true lease and not
a conditional sale. Da Rocha v. Macomber, 330 Mass. 611, 614-15, 116 N.E.2d
139, 142 (1953). Under section 1-203, the same result would follow. While
the lessee is obligated to pay rent for the one-month term of the lease, one
of the other four conditions of section 1-203(b) must be met and none is.
The term of the lease is one month and the economic life of the machine is
36 months; thus, section 1-203(b)(1) is not now satisfied. Considering the
amount of the monthly rent, absent economic duress or coercion, the lessee
is not bound either to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of
the goods or to become the owner. If the lessee did lease the machine for
36 months, the lessee would have paid the lessor $3,600 for a machine that
could have been purchased for $1,000; thus, section 1-203(b)(2) is not satisfied.
Finally, there are no options; thus, subparagraphs (3) and (4) of section
1-203(b) are not satisfied. This transaction creates a lease, not a security
interest. However, with each renewal of the lease the facts and circumstances
at the time of each renewal must be examined to determine if that conclusion
remains accurate, as it is possible that a transaction that first creates
a lease, later creates a security interest.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Assume that the facts are changed and that A requires each lessee to
lease the goods for 36 months, with no right to terminate. Under pre-code
security law this transaction would have created a conditional sale, and not
a bailment for hire or true lease. Hervey v. Rhode Island Locomotive Works,
93 U.S. 664, 672-73 (1876). Under this subsection, and section 1-203, the
same result would follow. The lessee's obligation for the term is not subject
to termination by the lessee and the term is equal to the economic life of
the machine.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">Between these extremes there are many transactions that can be created.
Some of the transactions were not properly categorized by the courts in applying
the 1978 and earlier official texts of former section 1-201(37). This subsection,
together with section 1-203, draws a brighter line, which should create a
clearer signal to the professional lessor and lessee.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(k) "Lease agreement". This definition is derived from section 1-201(b)(3).
Because the definition of lease is broad enough to cover future transfers,
lease agreement includes an agreement contemplating a current or subsequent
transfer. Thus it was not necessary to make an express reference to an agreement
for the future lease of goods (section 2-106(1)). This concept is also incorporated
in the definition of lease contract. Note that the definition of lease does
not include transactions in ordinary building materials that are incorporated
into an improvement on land. Section 2A-309(2).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">The provisions of this article, if applicable, determine whether a lease
agreement has legal consequences; otherwise the law of bailments and other
applicable law determine the same. Sections 1-103 and 2A-103(4).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(l) "Lease contract". This definition is derived from the definition
of contract in section 1-201(b)(12). Note that a lease contract may be for
the future lease of goods, since this notion is included in the definition
of lease.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(m) "Leasehold interest". New.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(n) "Lessee". New.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(o) "Lessee in ordinary course of business". Section 1-201(b)(9).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(p) "Lessor". New.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(q) "Lessor's residual interest". New.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(r) "Lien". New. This term is used in section 2A-307 (priority of liens
arising by attachment or levy on, security interests in, and other claims
to goods).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(s) "Lot". Section 2-105(5).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(t) "Merchant lessee". New. This term is used in section 2A-511 (merchant
lessee's duties as to rightfully rejected goods). A person may satisfy the
requirement of dealing in goods of the kind subject to the lease as lessor,
lessee, seller, or buyer.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(u) "Purchase". Section 1-201(b)(29). This definition omits the reference
to lien contained in the definition of purchase in article 1 (section 1-201(b)(29)).
This should not be construed to exclude consensual liens from the definition
of purchase in this article; the exclusion was mandated by the scope of the
definition of lien in section 2A-103(1)(r). Further, the definition of purchaser
in this article adds a reference to lease; as purchase is defined in section
1-201(b)(29) to include any other voluntary transaction creating an interest
in property, this addition is not substantive.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(v) "Sublease". New.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(w) "Supplier". New.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(x) "Supply contract". New.</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">(y) "Termination". Section 2-106(3).</div>
<br><div style="text-indent: 1em;">The effect of a termination is provided in section 2A-505(2).</div>
